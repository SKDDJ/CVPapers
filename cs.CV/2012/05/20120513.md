- **Summary**: A gray-level image texture descriptors based on fractal dimension estimation is proposed in this work. The proposed method estimates the fractal dimension using probability (Voss) method. The descriptors are computed applying a multiscale transform to the fractal dimension curves of the texture image. The proposed texture descriptor method is evaluated in a classification task of well known benchmark texture datasets. The results show the great performance of the proposed method as a tool for texture images analysis and characterization.

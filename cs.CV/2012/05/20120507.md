- **Summary**: Contrast enhancement is an important area of research for the image analysis. Over the decade, the researcher worked on this domain to develop an efficient and adequate algorithm. The proposed method will enhance the contrast of image using Binarization method with the help of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The paper aims to enhance the image contrast of bimodal and multi-modal images. The proposed methodology use to collect mathematical information retrieves from the image. In this paper, we are using binarization method that generates the desired histogram by separating image nodes. It generates the enhanced image using histogram specification with binarization method. The proposed method has showed an improvement in the image contrast enhancement compare with the other image.

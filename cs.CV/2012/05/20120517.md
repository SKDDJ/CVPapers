- **Summary**: This paper demonstrates the use of neural networks for developing a system that can recognize hand-written English alphabets. In this system, each English alphabet is represented by binary values that are used as input to a simple feature extraction system, whose output is fed to our neural network system.

- **Summary**: According to the character of Gaussian, we modify the Rank-Ordered Absolute Differences (ROAD) to Rank-Ordered Absolute Differences of mixture of Gaussian and impulse noises (ROADG). It will be more effective to detect impulse noise when the impulse is mixed with Gaussian noise. Combining rightly the ROADG with Optimal Weights Filter (OWF), we obtain a new method to deal with the mixed noise, called Optimal Weights Mixed Filter (OWMF). The simulation results show that the method is effective to remove the mixed noise.

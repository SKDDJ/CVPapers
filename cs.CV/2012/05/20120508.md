- **Summary**: This paper discusses a novel method for Facial Expression Recognition System which performs facial expression analysis in a near real time from a live web cam feed. Primary objectives were to get results in a near real time with light invariant, person independent and pose invariant way. The system is composed of two different entities trainer and evaluator. Each frame of video feed is passed through a series of steps including haar classifiers, skin detection, feature extraction, feature points tracking, creating a learned Support Vector Machine model to classify emotions to achieve a tradeoff between accuracy and result rate. A processing time of 100-120 ms per 10 frames was achieved with accuracy of around 60%. We measure our accuracy in terms of variety of interaction and classification scenarios. We conclude by discussing relevance of our work to human computer interaction and exploring further measures that can be taken.

- **Summary**: The success rates of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for printed Malayalam documents is quite impressive with the state of the art accuracy levels in the range of 85-95% for various. However for real applications, further enhancement of this accuracy levels are required. One of the bottle necks in further enhancement of the accuracy is identified as close-matching characters. In this paper, we delineate the close matching characters in Malayalam and report the development of a specialised classifier for these close-matching characters. The output of a state of the art of OCR is taken and characters falling into the close-matching character set is further fed into this specialised classifier for enhancing the accuracy. The classifier is based on support vector machine algorithm and uses feature vectors derived out of spectral coefficients of projection histogram signals of close-matching characters.

- **Summary**: The applications using face biometric has proved its reliability in last decade. In this paper, we propose DBC based Face Recognition using DWT (DBC- FR) model. The Poly-U Near Infra Red (NIR) database images are scanned and cropped to get only the face part in pre-processing. The face part is resized to 100*100 and DWT is applied to derive LL, LH, HL and HH subbands. The LL subband of size 50*50 is converted into 100 cells with 5*5 dimention of each cell. The Directional Binary Code (DBC) is applied on each 5*5 cell to derive 100 features. The Euclidian distance measure is used to compare the features of test image and database images. The proposed algorithm render better percentage recognition rate compared to the existing algorithm.

- **Summary**: Image fusion produces a single fused image from a set of input images. A new method for image fusion is proposed based on Weighted Average Merging Method (WAMM) in the NonSubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) domain. A performance analysis on various statistical fusion rules are also analysed both in NSCT and Wavelet domain. Analysis has been made on medical images, remote sensing images and multi focus images. Experimental results shows that the proposed method, WAMM obtained better results in NSCT domain than the wavelet domain as it preserves more edges and keeps the visual quality intact in the fused image.

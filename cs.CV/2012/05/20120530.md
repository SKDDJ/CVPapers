- **Summary**: This note presents some representative methods which are based on dictionary learning (DL) for classification. We do not review the sophisticated methods or frameworks that involve DL for classification, such as online DL and spatial pyramid matching (SPM), but rather, we concentrate on the direct DL-based classification methods. Here, the "so-called direct DL-based method" is the approach directly deals with DL framework by adding some meaningful penalty terms. By listing some representative methods, we can roughly divide them into two categories, i.e. (1) directly making the dictionary discriminative and (2) forcing the sparse coefficients discriminative to push the discrimination power of the dictionary. From this taxonomy, we can expect some extensions of them as future researches.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm based segmentation method that can automatically segment gray-scale images. The proposed method mainly consists of spatial unsupervised grayscale image segmentation that divides an image into regions. The aim of this algorithm is to produce precise segmentation of images using intensity information along with neighborhood relationships. In this paper, Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network (FHNN) clustering helps in generating the population of Genetic algorithm which there by automatically segments the image. This technique is a powerful method for image segmentation and works for both single and multiple-feature data with spatial information. Validity index has been utilized for introducing a robust technique for finding the optimum number of components in an image. Experimental results shown that the algorithm generates good quality segmented image.

- **Summary**: We present a scale-invariant, template-based segmentation paradigm that sets up a graph and performs a graph cut to separate an object from the background. Typically graph-based schemes distribute the nodes of the graph uniformly and equidistantly on the image, and use a regularizer to bias the cut towards a particular shape. The strategy of uniform and equidistant nodes does not allow the cut to prefer more complex structures, especially when areas of the object are indistinguishable from the background. We propose a solution by introducing the concept of a "template shape" of the target object in which the nodes are sampled non-uniformly and non-equidistantly on the image. We evaluate it on 2D-images where the object's textures and backgrounds are similar, and large areas of the object have the same gray level appearance as the background. We also evaluate it in 3D on 60 brain tumor datasets for neurosurgical planning purposes.

- **Summary**: A novel method of gender Classification from fingerprint is proposed based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD). The classification is achieved by extracting the energy computed from all the sub-bands of DWT combined with the spatial features of non-zero singular values obtained from the SVD of fingerprint images. K nearest neighbor (KNN) used as a classifier. This method is experimented with the internal database of 3570 fingerprints finger prints in which 1980 were male fingerprints and 1590 were female fingerprints. Finger-wise gender classification is achieved which is 94.32% for the left hand little fingers of female persons and 95.46% for the left hand index finger of male persons. Gender classification for any finger of male persons tested is attained as 91.67% and 84.69% for female persons respectively. Overall classification rate is 88.28% has been achieved.

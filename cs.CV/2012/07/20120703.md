- **Summary**: When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.

- **Summary**: The understanding of neurodegenerative diseases undoubtedly passes through the study of human brain white matter fiber tracts. To date, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the unique technique to obtain information about the neural architecture of the human brain, thus permitting the study of white matter connections and their integrity. However, a remaining challenge of the dMRI community is to better characterize complex fiber crossing configurations, where diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is limited but high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) now brings solutions. This paper investigates the development of both identification and classification process of the local water diffusion phenomenon based on HARDI data to automatically detect imaging voxels where there are single and crossing fiber bundle populations. The technique is based on knowledge extraction processes and is validated on a dMRI phantom dataset with ground truth.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of medical images is a challenging task owing to their complexity. A standard segmentation problem within Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the task of labeling voxels according to their tissue type. Image segmentation provides volumetric quantification of liver area and thus helps in the diagnosis of disorders, such as Hepatitis, Cirrhosis, Jaundice, Hemochromatosis etc.This work deals with comparison of segmentation by applying Level Set Method,Fuzzy Level Information C-Means Clustering Algorithm and Gradient Vector Flow Snake Algorithm.The results are compared using the parameters such as Number of pixels correctly classified, and percentage of area segmented.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach for filter design based on stochastic distances and tests between distributions. A window is defined around each pixel, samples are compared and only those which pass a goodness-of-fit test are used to compute the filtered value. The technique is applied to intensity Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using the Gamma model with varying number of looks allowing, thus, changes in heterogeneity. Modified Nagao-Matsuyama windows are used to define the samples. The proposal is compared with the Lee's filter which is considered a standard, using a protocol based on simulation. Among the criteria used to quantify the quality of filters, we employ the equivalent number of looks (related to the signal-to-noise ratio), line contrast, and edge preservation. Moreover, we also assessed the filters by the Universal Image Quality Index and the Pearson's correlation between edges.

- **Summary**: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images are establishing as an important source of information in remote sensing applications. The most complete format this type of imaging produces consists of complex-valued Hermitian matrices in every image coordinate and, as such, their visualization is challenging. They also suffer from speckle noise which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. Smoothing techniques have been proposed in the literature aiming at preserving different features and, analogously, projections from the cone of Hermitian positive matrices to different color representation spaces are used for enhancing certain characteristics. In this work we propose the use of stochastic distances between models that describe this type of data in a Nagao-Matsuyama-type of smoothing technique. The resulting images are shown to present good visualization properties (noise reduction with preservation of fine details) in all the considered visualization spaces.

- **Summary**: We propose a fast approximate algorithm for large graph matching. A new projected fixed-point method is defined and a new doubly stochastic projection is adopted to derive the algorithm. Previous graph matching algorithms suffer from high computational complexity and therefore do not have good scalability with respect to graph size. For matching two weighted graphs of $n$ nodes, our algorithm has time complexity only $O(n^3)$ per iteration and space complexity $O(n^2)$. In addition to its scalability, our algorithm is easy to implement, robust, and able to match undirected weighted attributed graphs of different sizes. While the convergence rate of previous iterative graph matching algorithms is unknown, our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge at a linear rate. Extensive experiments on large synthetic and real graphs (more than 1,000 nodes) were conducted to evaluate the performance of various algorithms. Results show that in most cases our proposed algorithm achieves better performance than previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy in large graph matching. In particular, with high accuracy, our algorithm takes only a few seconds (in a PC) to match two graphs of 1,000 nodes.

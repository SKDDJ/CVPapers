- **Summary**: We present an approach for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image region boundary detection based on the use of B-Spline active contours and a new model for polarimetric SAR data: the GHP distribution. In order to detect the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area. This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented. Results of its performance are presented.

- **Summary**: We show that the Hausdorff distance for two sets of non-intersecting line segments can be computed in parallel in $O(\log^2 n)$ time using O(n) processors in a CREW-PRAM computation model. We discuss how some parts of the sequential algorithm can be performed in parallel using previously known parallel algorithms; and identify the so-far unsolved part of the problem for the parallel computation, which is the following: Given two sets of $x$-monotone curve segments, red and blue, for each red segment find its extremal intersection points with the blue set, i.e. points with the minimal and maximal $x$-coordinate. Each segment set is assumed to be intersection free. For this intersection problem we describe a parallel algorithm which completes the Hausdorff distance computation within the stated time and processor bounds.

- **Summary**: Textures often show multiscale properties and hence multiscale techniques are considered useful for texture analysis. Scale-space theory as a biologically motivated approach may be used to construct multiscale textures. In this paper various ways are studied to combine features on different scales for texture classification of small image patches. We use the N-jet of derivatives up to the second order at different scales to generate distinct pattern representations (DPR) of feature subsets. Each feature subset in the DPR is given to a base classifier (BC) of a two-stage combined classifier. The decisions made by these BCs are combined in two stages over scales and derivatives. Various combining systems and their significances and differences are discussed. The learning curves are used to evaluate the performances. We found for small sample sizes combining classifiers performs significantly better than combining feature spaces (CFS). It is also shown that combining classifiers performs better than the support vector machine on CFS in multiscale texture classification.

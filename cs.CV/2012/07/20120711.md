- **Summary**: Human face recognition is, indeed, a challenging task, especially under the illumination and pose variations. We examine in the present paper effectiveness of two simple algorithms using coiflet packet and Radon transforms to recognize human faces from some databases of still gray level images, under the environment of illumination and pose variations. Both the algorithms convert 2-D gray level training face images into their respective depth maps or physical shape which are subsequently transformed by Coiflet packet and Radon transforms to compute energy for feature extraction. Experiments show that such transformed shape features are robust to illumination and pose variations. With the features extracted, training classes are optimally separated through linear discriminant analysis (LDA), while classification for test face images is made through a k-NN classifier, based on L1 norm and Mahalanobis distance measures. Proposed algorithms are then tested on face images that differ in illumination,expression or pose separately, obtained from three databases,namely, ORL, Yale and Essex-Grimace databases. Results, so obtained, are compared with two different existing algorithms.Performance using Daubechies wavelets is also examined. It is seen that the proposed Coiflet packet and Radon transform based algorithms have significant performance, especially under different illumination conditions and pose variation. Comparison shows the proposed algorithms are superior.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we have worked on reducing burden on mechanic involving complex automobile maintenance activities that are performed in centralised workshops. We have presented a system prototype that combines Augmented Reality with Kinect. With the use of Kinect, very high quality sensors are available at considerably low costs, thus reducing overall expenditure for system design. The system can be operated either in Speech mode or in Gesture mode. The system can be controlled by various audio commands if user opts for Speech mode. The same controlling can also be done by using a set of Gestures in Gesture mode.   Gesture recognition is the task performed by Kinect system. This system, bundled with RGB and Depth camera, processes the skeletal data by keeping track of 20 different body joints. Recognizing Gestures is done by verifying user movements and checking them against predefined condition. Augmented Reality module captures real-time image data streams from high resolution camera. This module then generates 3D model that is superimposed on real time data.

- **Summary**: DNA-binding proteins are a class of proteins which have a specific or general affinity to DNA and include three important components: transcription factors; nucleases, and histones. DNA-binding proteins also perform important roles in many types of cellular activities. In this paper we describe machine learning systems for the prediction of DNA- binding proteins where a Support Vector Machine and a Cascade Correlation Neural Network are optimized and then compared to determine the learning algorithm that achieves the best prediction performance. The information used for classification is derived from characteristics that include overall charge, patch size and amino acids composition. In total 121 DNA- binding proteins and 238 non-binding proteins are used to build and evaluate the system. For SVM using the ANOVA Kernel with Jack-knife evaluation, an accuracy of 86.7% has been achieved with 91.1% for sensitivity and 85.3% for specificity. For CCNN optimized over the entire dataset with Jack knife evaluation we report an accuracy of 75.4%, while the values of specificity and sensitivity achieved were 72.3% and 82.6%, respectively.

- **Summary**: The traditional color-based mean-shift tracking algorithm is popular among tracking methods due to its simple and efficient procedure, however, the lack of dynamism in its target model makes it unsuitable for tracking objects which have changes in their sizes and shapes. In this paper, we propose a fast novel threephase colored object tracker algorithm based on mean shift idea while utilizing adaptive model. The proposed method can improve the mentioned weaknesses of the original mean-shift algorithm. The experimental results show that the new method is feasible, robust and has acceptable speed in comparison with other algorithms.15 page,

- **Summary**: Previous research showed that camera specific noise patterns, so-called PRNU-patterns, are extracted from images and related images could be found. In this particular research the focus is on grouping images from a database, based on a shared noise pattern as an identification method for cameras. Using the method as described in this article, groups of images, created using the same camera, could be linked from a large database of images. Using MATLAB programming, relevant image noise patterns are extracted from images much quicker than common methods by the use of faster noise extraction filters and improvements to reduce the calculation costs. Relating noise patterns, with a correlation above a certain threshold value, can quickly be matched. Hereby, from a database of images, groups of relating images could be linked and the method could be used to scan a large number of images for suspect noise patterns.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of unsupervised learning of complex articulated object models from 3D range data. We describe an algorithm whose input is a set of meshes corresponding to different configurations of an articulated object. The algorithm automatically recovers a decomposition of the object into approximately rigid parts, the location of the parts in the different object instances, and the articulated object skeleton linking the parts. Our algorithm first registers allthe meshes using an unsupervised non-rigid technique described in a companion paper. It then segments the meshes using a graphical model that captures the spatial contiguity of parts. The segmentation is done using the EM algorithm, iterating between finding a decomposition of the object into rigid parts, and finding the location of the parts in the object instances. Although the graphical model is densely connected, the object decomposition step can be performed optimally and efficiently, allowing us to identify a large number of object parts while avoiding local maxima. We demonstrate the algorithm on real world datasets, recovering a 15-part articulated model of a human puppet from just 7 different puppet configurations, as well as a 4 part model of a fiexing arm where significant non-rigid deformation was present.

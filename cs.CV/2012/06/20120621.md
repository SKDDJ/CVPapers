- **Summary**: Here I suggest the use of a 3D scanning and rendering to create some virtual copies of ancient artifacts to study and compare them. In particular, this approach could be interesting for some roman marble busts, two of which are portraits of Julius Caesar, and the third is a realistic portrait of a man recently found at Arles, France. The comparison of some images indicates that a three-dimensional visualization is necessary.

- **Summary**: Principle Component Analysis PCA is a classical feature extraction and data representation technique widely used in pattern recognition. It is one of the most successful techniques in face recognition. But it has drawback of high computational especially for big size database. This paper conducts a study to optimize the time complexity of PCA (eigenfaces) that does not affects the recognition performance. The authors minimize the participated eigenvectors which consequently decreases the computational time. A comparison is done to compare the differences between the recognition time in the original algorithm and in the enhanced algorithm. The performance of the original and the enhanced proposed algorithm is tested on face94 face database. Experimental results show that the recognition time is reduced by 35% by applying our proposed enhanced algorithm. DET Curves are used to illustrate the experimental results.

- **Summary**: The ultimate aim of handwriting recognition is to make computers able to read and/or authenticate human written texts, with a performance comparable to or even better than that of humans. Reading means that the computer is given a piece of handwriting and it provides the electronic transcription of that (e.g. in ASCII format). Two types of handwriting: on-line and offline. The most important purpose of off-line handwriting recognition is in protection systems and authentication. Arabic Handwriting scripts are much more complicated in comparison to Latin scripts. This paper introduces a simple and novel methodology to authenticate Arabic handwriting characters. Reaching our aim, we built our own character database. The research methodology depends on two stages: The first is character extraction where preprocessing the word and then apply segmentation process to obtain the character. The second is the character recognition by matching the characters comprising the word with the letters in the database. Our results ensure character recognition with 81%. We eliminate FAR by using similarity percent between 45-55%. Our research is coded using MATLAB.

- **Summary**: This Paper Analyze the performance of Unsymmetrical trimmed median, which is used as detector for the detection of impulse noise, Gaussian noise and mixed noise is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses a fixed 3x3 window for the increasing noise densities. The pixels in the current window are arranged in sorting order using a improved snake like sorting algorithm with reduced comparator. The processed pixel is checked for the occurrence of outliers, if the absolute difference between processed pixels is greater than fixed threshold. Under high noise densities the processed pixel is also noisy hence the median is checked using the above procedure. if found true then the pixel is considered as noisy hence the corrupted pixel is replaced by the median of the current processing window. If median is also noisy then replace the corrupted pixel with unsymmetrical trimmed median else if the pixel is termed uncorrupted and left unaltered. The proposed algorithm (PA) is tested on varying detail images for various noises. The proposed algorithm effectively removes the high density fixed value impulse noise, low density random valued impulse noise, low density Gaussian noise and lower proportion of mixed noise. The proposed algorithm is targeted on Xc3e5000-5fg900 FPGA using Xilinx 7.1 compiler version which requires less number of slices, optimum speed and low power when compared to the other median finding architectures.

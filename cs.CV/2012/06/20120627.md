- **Summary**: We present a machine learning approach for estimating the second derivative of a drivable surface, its roughness. Robot perception generally focuses on the first derivative, obstacle detection. However, the second derivative is also important due to its direct relation (with speed) to the shock the vehicle experiences. Knowing the second derivative allows a vehicle to slow down in advance of rough terrain. Estimating the second derivative is challenging due to uncertainty. For example, at range, laser readings may be so sparse that significant information about the surface is missing. Also, a high degree of precision is required in projecting laser readings. This precision may be unavailable due to latency or error in the pose estimation. We model these sources of error as a multivariate polynomial. Its coefficients are learned using the shock data as ground truth -- the accelerometers are used to train the lasers. The resulting classifier operates on individual laser readings from a road surface described by a 3D point cloud. The classifier identifies sections of road where the second derivative is likely to be large. Thus, the vehicle can slow down in advance, reducing the shock it experiences. The algorithm is an evolution of one we used in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. We analyze it using data from that route.

- **Summary**: In many domains that involve the use of sensors, such as robotics or sensor networks, there are opportunities to use some form of active sensing to disambiguate data from noisy or unreliable sensors. These disambiguating actions typically take time and expend energy. One way to choose the next disambiguating action is to select the action with the greatest expected entropy reduction, or information gain. In this work, we consider active sensing in aid of stereo vision for robotics. Stereo vision is a powerful sensing technique for mobile robots, but it can fail in scenes that lack strong texture. In such cases, a structured light source, such as vertical laser line can be used for disambiguation. By treating the stereo matching problem as a specially structured HMM-like graphical model, we demonstrate that for a scan line with n columns and maximum stereo disparity d, the entropy minimizing aim point for the laser can be selected in O(nd) time - cost no greater than the stereo algorithm itself. In contrast, a typical HMM formulation would suggest at least O(nd^2) time for the entropy calculation alone.

- **Summary**: Learning invariant representations is an important problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a novel framework of transformation-invariant feature learning by incorporating linear transformations into the feature learning algorithms. For example, we present the transformation-invariant restricted Boltzmann machine that compactly represents data by its weights and their transformations, which achieves invariance of the feature representation via probabilistic max pooling. In addition, we show that our transformation-invariant feature learning framework can also be extended to other unsupervised learning methods, such as autoencoders or sparse coding. We evaluate our method on several image classification benchmark datasets, such as MNIST variations, CIFAR-10, and STL-10, and show competitive or superior classification performance when compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on phone classification tasks with the TIMIT dataset, which demonstrates wide applicability of our proposed algorithms to other domains.

- **Summary**: Matching one set of objects to another is a ubiquitous task in machine learning and computer vision that often reduces to some form of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The QAP is known to be notoriously hard, both in theory and in practice. Here, we investigate if this difficulty can be mitigated when some additional piece of information is available: (a) that all QAP instances of interest come from the same application, and (b) the correct solution for a set of such QAP instances is given. We propose a new approach to accelerate the solution of QAPs based on learning parameters for a modified objective function from prior QAP instances. A key feature of our approach is that it takes advantage of the algebraic structure of permutations, in conjunction with special methods for optimizing functions over the symmetric group Sn in Fourier space. Experiments show that in practical domains the new method can outperform existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Natural image statistics exhibit hierarchical dependencies across multiple scales. Representing such prior knowledge in non-factorial latent tree models can boost performance of image denoising, inpainting, deconvolution or reconstruction substantially, beyond standard factorial "sparse" methodology. We derive a large scale approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for linear models with non-factorial (latent tree-structured) scale mixture priors. Experimental results on a range of denoising and inpainting problems demonstrate substantially improved performance compared to MAP estimation or to inference with factorial priors.

- **Summary**: Visual perception is a challenging problem in part due to illumination variations. A possible solution is to first estimate an illumination invariant representation before using it for recognition. The object albedo and surface normals are examples of such representations. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer generative model where the latent variables include the albedo, surface normals, and the light source. Combining Deep Belief Nets with the Lambertian reflectance assumption, our model can learn good priors over the albedo from 2D images. Illumination variations can be explained by changing only the lighting latent variable in our model. By transferring learned knowledge from similar objects, albedo and surface normals estimation from a single image is possible in our model. Experiments demonstrate that our model is able to generalize as well as improve over standard baselines in one-shot face recognition.

- **Summary**: Functional neuroimaging can measure the brain?s response to an external stimulus. It is used to perform brain mapping: identifying from these observations the brain regions involved. This problem can be cast into a linear supervised learning task where the neuroimaging data are used as predictors for the stimulus. Brain mapping is then seen as a support recovery problem. On functional MRI (fMRI) data, this problem is particularly challenging as i) the number of samples is small due to limited acquisition time and ii) the variables are strongly correlated. We propose to overcome these difficulties using sparse regression models over new variables obtained by clustering of the original variables. The use of randomization techniques, e.g. bootstrap samples, and clustering of the variables improves the recovery properties of sparse methods. We demonstrate the benefit of our approach on an extensive simulation study as well as two fMRI datasets.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of learning object arrangements in a 3D scene. The key idea here is to learn how objects relate to human poses based on their affordances, ease of use and reachability. In contrast to modeling object-object relationships, modeling human-object relationships scales linearly in the number of objects. We design appropriate density functions based on 3D spatial features to capture this. We learn the distribution of human poses in a scene using a variant of the Dirichlet process mixture model that allows sharing of the density function parameters across the same object types. Then we can reason about arrangements of the objects in the room based on these meaningful human poses. In our extensive experiments on 20 different rooms with a total of 47 objects, our algorithm predicted correct placements with an average error of 1.6 meters from ground truth. In arranging five real scenes, it received a score of 4.3/5 compared to 3.7 for the best baseline method.

- **Summary**: Latent feature models are attractive for image modeling, since images generally contain multiple objects. However, many latent feature models ignore that objects can appear at different locations or require pre-segmentation of images. While the transformed Indian buffet process (tIBP) provides a method for modeling transformation-invariant features in unsegmented binary images, its current form is inappropriate for real images because of its computational cost and modeling assumptions. We combine the tIBP with likelihoods appropriate for real images and develop an efficient inference, using the cross-correlation between images and features, that is theoretically and empirically faster than existing inference techniques. Our method discovers reasonable components and achieve effective image reconstruction in natural images.

- **Summary**: This paper present our color constancy investigation in the hybridization of Wireless LAN and Camera positioning in the mobile phone. Five typical color constancy schemes are analyzed in different location environment. The results can be used to combine with RF signals from Wireless LAN positioning by using model fitting approach in order to establish absolute positioning output. There is no conventional searching algorithm required, thus it is expected to reduce the complexity of computation. Finally we present our preliminary results to illustrate the indoor positioning algorithm performance evaluation for an indoor environment set-up.

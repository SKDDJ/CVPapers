- **Summary**: Splines can be constructed by convolving the indicator function of the Voronoi cell of a lattice. This paper presents simple criteria that imply that only a small subset of such spline families can be refined: essentially the well-known box splines and tensor-product splines. Among the many non-refinable constructions are hex-splines and their generalization to non-Cartesian lattices. An example shows how non-refinable splines can exhibit increased approximation error upon refinement of the lattice.

- **Summary**: As smartphones become more pervasive, they are increasingly targeted by malware. At the same time, each new generation of smartphone features increasingly powerful onboard sensor suites. A new strain of sensor malware has been developing that leverages these sensors to steal information from the physical environment (e.g., researchers have recently demonstrated how malware can listen for spoken credit card numbers through the microphone, or feel keystroke vibrations using the accelerometer). Yet the possibilities of what malware can see through a camera have been understudied. This paper introduces a novel visual malware called PlaceRaider, which allows remote attackers to engage in remote reconnaissance and what we call virtual theft. Through completely opportunistic use of the camera on the phone and other sensors, PlaceRaider constructs rich, three dimensional models of indoor environments. Remote burglars can thus download the physical space, study the environment carefully, and steal virtual objects from the environment (such as financial documents, information on computer monitors, and personally identifiable information). Through two human subject studies we demonstrate the effectiveness of using mobile devices as powerful surveillance and virtual theft platforms, and we suggest several possible defenses against visual malware.

- **Summary**: With the advent of digital images the problem of keeping picture visualization uniformity arises because each printing or scanning device has its own color chart. So, universal color profiles are made by ICC to bring uniformity in various types of devices. Keeping that color profile in mind various new color charts are created and calibrated with the help of standard IT8 test charts available in the market. The main objective to color reproduction is to produce the identical picture at device output. For that principles for gamut mapping has been designed

- **Summary**: The main problem in colour management in prepress department is lack of availability of literature on colour management and knowledge gap between prepress department and press department. So a digital test from has been created by Adobe Photoshop to analyse the ICC profile and to create a new profile and this analysed data is used to study about various grey scale of RGB and CMYK images. That helps in conversion of image from RGB to CMYK in prepress department.

- **Summary**: By taking into account the properties and limitations of the human visual system, images can be more efficiently compressed, colors more accurately reproduced, prints better rendered. To show all these advantages in this paper new adapted color charts have been created based on technical and visual image category analysis. A number of tests have been carried out using extreme images with their key information strictly in dark and light areas. It was shown that the image categorization using the adapted color charts improves the analysis of relevant image information with regard to both the image gradation and the detail reproduction. The images with key information in hi-key areas were also test printed using the adapted color charts.

- **Summary**: The production of a printed product involves three stages: prepress, the printing process (press) itself, and finishing (post press). There are various types of equipments (printers, scanners) and various qualities image are present in the market. These give different color rendering each time during reproduction. So, a color key tool has been developed keeping Color Management Scheme (CMS) in mind so that during reproduction no color rendering takes place irrespective of use of any device and resolution level has also been improved.

- **Summary**: Many computer vision algorithms depend on a variety of parameter choices and settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to evaluating a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it can be difficult to determine whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.   In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyper parameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools to replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from parameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyper parameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single algorithm. More broadly, we argue that the formalization of a meta-model supports more objective, reproducible, and quantitative evaluation of computer vision algorithms, and that it can serve as a valuable tool for guiding algorithm development.

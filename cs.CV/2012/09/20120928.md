- **Summary**: With systems for acquiring 3D surface data being evermore commonplace, it has become important to reliably extract specific shapes from the acquired data. In the presence of noise and occlusions, this can be done through the use of statistical shape models, which are learned from databases of clean examples of the shape in question. In this paper, we review, analyze and compare different statistical models: from those that analyze the variation in geometry globally to those that analyze the variation in geometry locally. We first review how different types of models have been used in the literature, then proceed to define the models and analyze them theoretically, in terms of both their statistical and computational aspects. We then perform extensive experimental comparison on the task of model fitting, and give intuition about which type of model is better for a few applications. Due to the wide availability of databases of high-quality data, we use the human face as the specific shape we wish to extract from corrupted data.

- **Summary**: Computer tomographic colonography, combined with computer-aided detection, is a promising emerging technique for colonic polyp analysis. We present a complete pipeline for polyp detection, starting with a simple colon segmentation technique that enhances polyps, followed by an adaptive-scale candidate polyp delineation and classification based on new texture and geometric features that consider both the information in the candidate polyp location and its immediate surrounding area. The proposed system is tested with ground truth data, including flat and small polyps which are hard to detect even with optical colonoscopy. For polyps larger than 6mm in size we achieve 100% sensitivity with just 0.9 false positives per case, and for polyps larger than 3mm in size we achieve 93% sensitivity with 2.8 false positives per case.

- **Summary**: We present a novel sparse modeling approach to non-rigid shape matching using only the ability to detect repeatable regions. As the input to our algorithm, we are given only two sets of regions in two shapes; no descriptors are provided so the correspondence between the regions is not know, nor we know how many regions correspond in the two shapes. We show that even with such scarce information, it is possible to establish very accurate correspondence between the shapes by using methods from the field of sparse modeling, being this, the first non-trivial use of sparse models in shape correspondence. We formulate the problem of permuted sparse coding, in which we solve simultaneously for an unknown permutation ordering the regions on two shapes and for an unknown correspondence in functional representation. We also propose a robust variant capable of handling incomplete matches. Numerically, the problem is solved efficiently by alternating the solution of a linear assignment and a sparse coding problem. The proposed methods are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on standard benchmarks containing both synthetic and scanned objects.

- **Summary**: The use of Laplacian eigenbases has been shown to be fruitful in many computer graphics applications. Today, state-of-the-art approaches to shape analysis, synthesis, and correspondence rely on these natural harmonic bases that allow using classical tools from harmonic analysis on manifolds. However, many applications involving multiple shapes are obstacled by the fact that Laplacian eigenbases computed independently on different shapes are often incompatible with each other. In this paper, we propose the construction of common approximate eigenbases for multiple shapes using approximate joint diagonalization algorithms. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach on tasks from shape editing, pose transfer, correspondence, and similarity.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral images (HIS) classification is a high technical remote sensing tool. The goal is to reproduce a thematic map that will be compared with a reference ground truth map (GT), constructed by expecting the region. The HIS contains more than a hundred bidirectional measures, called bands (or simply images), of the same region. They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies. Unfortunately, some bands contain redundant information, others are affected by the noise, and the high dimensionality of features made the accuracy of classification lower. The problematic is how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and threshold, to select relevant bands, without treatment of redundancy. Others control and eliminate redundancy by selecting the band top ranking the MI, and if its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered redundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method, because this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious information can be discarded. In this paper we'll accept the useful redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it contributes to produce an estimated reference map that has higher MI with the GT.nTo control redundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold added to last value of MI. This process is a Filter strategy; it gets a better performance of classification accuracy and not expensive, but less preferment than Wrapper strategy.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image is a substitution of more than a hundred images, called bands, of the same region. They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies. The reference image of the region is called Ground Truth map (GT). the problematic is how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions; because the bands can be not only redundant, but a source of confusion, and decreasing so the accuracy of classification. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and threshold, to select relevant bands. Recently there's an algorithm selection based on mutual information, using bandwidth rejection and a threshold to control and eliminate redundancy. The band top ranking the MI is selected, and if its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered redundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method, because this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious information can be discarded. In this paper we'll make difference between useful and useless redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it contributes to decreasing error probability. According to this scheme, we introduce new algorithm using also mutual information, but it retains only the bands minimizing the error probability of classification. To control redundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold. So the good band candidate must contribute to decrease the last error probability augmented by the threshold. This process is a wrapper strategy; it gets high performance of classification accuracy but it is expensive than filter strategy.

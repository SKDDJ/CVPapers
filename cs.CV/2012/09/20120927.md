- **Summary**: The Active Shape Model (ASM) is one of the most popular local texture models for face alignment. It applies in many fields such as locating facial features in the image, face synthesis, etc. However, the experimental results show that the accuracy of the classical ASM for some applications is not high. This paper suggests some improvements on the classical ASM to increase the performance of the model in the application: face alignment. Four of our major improvements include: i) building a model combining Sobel filter and the 2-D profile in searching face in image; ii) applying Canny algorithm for the enhancement edge on image; iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify landmarks on face, in order to determine exactly location of these landmarks support for ASM; iv)automatically adjust 2-D profile in the multi-level model based on the size of the input image. The experimental results on Caltech face database and Technical University of Denmark database (imm_face) show that our proposed improvement leads to far better performance.

- **Summary**: This paper proves that in iris recognition, the concepts of sheep, goats, lambs and wolves - as proposed by Doddington and Yager in the so-called Biometric Menagerie, are at most fuzzy and at least not quite well defined. They depend not only on the users or on their biometric templates, but also on the parameters that calibrate the iris recognition system. This paper shows that, in the case of iris recognition, the extensions of these concepts have very unsharp and unstable (non-stationary) boundaries. The membership of a user to these categories is more often expressed as a degree (as a fuzzy value) rather than as a crisp value. Moreover, they are defined by fuzzy Sugeno rules instead of classical (crisp) definitions. For these reasons, we said that the Biometric Menagerie proposed by Doddington and Yager could be at most a fuzzy concept of biometry, but even this status is conditioned by improving its definition. All of these facts are confirmed experimentally in a series of 12 exhaustive iris recognition tests undertaken for University of Bath Iris Image Database while using three different iris code dimensions (256x16, 128x8 and 64x4), two different iris texture encoders (Log-Gabor and Haar-Hilbert) and two different types of safety models.

- **Summary**: This paper analyses the set of iris codes stored or used in an iris recognition system as an f-granular space. The f-granulation is given by identifying in the iris code space the extensions of the fuzzy concepts wolves, goats, lambs and sheep (previously introduced by Doddington as 'animals' of the biometric menagerie) - which together form a partitioning of the iris code space. The main question here is how objective (stable / stationary) this partitioning is when the iris segments are subject to noisy acquisition. In order to prove that the f-granulation of iris code space with respect to the fuzzy concepts that define the biometric menagerie is unstable in noisy conditions (is sensitive to noise), three types of noise (localvar, motion blur, salt and pepper) have been alternatively added to the iris segments extracted from University of Bath Iris Image Database. The results of 180 exhaustive (all-to-all) iris recognition tests are presented and commented here.



### Reclassification formula that provides to surpass K-means method

- **Summary**: The paper presents a formula for the reclassification of multidimensional data points (columns of real numbers, "objects", "vectors", etc.). This formula describes the change in the total squared error caused by reclassification of data points from one cluster into another and prompts the way to calculate the sequence of optimal partitions, which are characterized by a minimum value of the total squared error E (weighted sum of within-class variance, within-cluster sum of squares WCSS etc.), i.e. the sum of squared distances from each data point to its cluster center. At that source data points are treated with repetitions allowed, and resulting clusters from different partitions, in general case, overlap each other. The final partitions are characterized by "equilibrium" stability with respect to the reclassification of the data points, where the term "stability" means that any prescribed reclassification of data points does not increase the total squared error E. It is important that conventional K-means method, in general case, provides generation of instable partitions with overstated values of the total squared error E. The proposed method, based on the formula of reclassification, is more efficient than K-means method owing to converting of any partition into stable one, as well as involving into the process of reclassification of certain sets of data points, in contrast to the classification of individual data points according to K-means method.

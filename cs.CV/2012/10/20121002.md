- **Summary**: Receptive field profiles registered by cell recordings have shown that mammalian vision has developed receptive fields tuned to different sizes and orientations in the image domain as well as to different image velocities in space-time. This article presents a theoretical model by which families of idealized receptive field profiles can be derived mathematically from a small set of basic assumptions that correspond to structural properties of the environment. The article also presents a theory for how basic invariance properties to variations in scale, viewing direction and relative motion can be obtained from the output of such receptive fields, using complementary selection mechanisms that operate over the output of families of receptive fields tuned to different parameters. Thereby, the theory shows how basic invariance properties of a visual system can be obtained already at the level of receptive fields, and we can explain the different shapes of receptive field profiles found in biological vision from a requirement that the visual system should be invariant to the natural types of image transformations that occur in its environment.

- **Summary**: This paper proposed the use of multi-instance feature level fusion as a means to improve the performance of Finger Knuckle Print (FKP) verification. A log-Gabor filter has been used to extract the image local orientation information, and represent the FKP features. Experiments are performed using the FKP database, which consists of 7,920 images. Results indicate that the multi-instance verification approach outperforms higher performance than using any single instance. The influence on biometric performance using feature level fusion under different fusion rules have been demonstrated in this paper.

- **Summary**: Based on a local approximation of the Riemannian distance on a manifold by a computationally cheap dissimilarity measure, a time discrete geodesic calculus is developed, and applications to shape space are explored. The dissimilarity measure is derived from a deformation energy whose Hessian reproduces the underlying Riemannian metric, and it is used to define length and energy of discrete paths in shape space. The notion of discrete geodesics defined as energy minimizing paths gives rise to a discrete logarithmic map, a variational definition of a discrete exponential map, and a time discrete parallel transport. This new concept is applied to a shape space in which shapes are considered as boundary contours of physical objects consisting of viscous material. The flexibility and computational efficiency of the approach is demonstrated for topology preserving shape morphing, the representation of paths in shape space via local shape variations as path generators, shape extrapolation via discrete geodesic flow, and the transfer of geometric features.

- **Summary**: Most biometric systems deployed in real-world applications are unimodal. Using unimodal biometric systems have to contend with a variety of problems such as: Noise in sensed data; Intra-class variations; Inter-class similarities; Non-universality; Spoof attacks. These problems have addressed by using multibiometric systems, which expected to be more reliable due to the presence of multiple, independent pieces of evidence.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a methodology of classifying hepatic (liver) lesions using multidimensional persistent homology, the matching metric (also called the bottleneck distance), and a support vector machine. We present our classification results on a dataset of 132 lesions that have been outlined and annotated by radiologists. We find that topological features are useful in the classification of hepatic lesions. We also find that two-dimensional persistent homology outperforms one-dimensional persistent homology in this application.

- **Summary**: In recent years, quantities derived from the heat equation have become popular in shape processing and analysis of triangulated surfaces. Such measures are often robust with respect to different kinds of perturbations, including near-isometries, topological noise and partialities. Here, we propose to exploit the semigroup of a Schr\"{o}dinger operator in order to deal with texture data, while maintaining the desirable properties of the heat kernel. We define a family of Schr\"{o}dinger diffusion distances analogous to the ones associated to the heat kernels, and show that they are continuous under perturbations of the data. As an application, we introduce a method for retrieval of textured shapes through comparison of Schr\"{o}dinger diffusion distance histograms with the earth's mover distance, and present some numerical experiments showing superior performance compared to an analogous method that ignores the texture.

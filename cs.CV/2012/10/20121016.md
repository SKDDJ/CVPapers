- **Summary**: Radon Transformation is generally used to construct optical image (like CT image) from the projection data in biomedical imaging. In this paper, the concept of Radon Transformation is implemented to reconstruct Electrical Impedance Topographic Image (conductivity or resistivity distribution) of a circular subject. A parallel resistance model of a subject is proposed for Electrical Impedance Topography(EIT) or Magnetic Induction Tomography(MIT). A circular subject with embedded circular objects is segmented into equal width slices from different angles. For each angle, Conductance and Conductivity of each slice is calculated and stored in an array. A back projection method is used to generate a two-dimensional image from one-dimensional projections. As a back projection method, Inverse Radon Transformation is applied on the calculated conductance and conductivity to reconstruct two dimensional images. These images are compared to the target image. In the time of image reconstruction, different filters are used and these images are compared with each other and target image.

- **Summary**: Hierarchical beta process has found interesting applications in recent years. In this paper we present a modified hierarchical beta process prior with applications to hierarchical modeling of multiple data sources. The novel use of the prior over a hierarchical factor model allows factors to be shared across different sources. We derive a slice sampler for this model, enabling tractable inference even when the likelihood and the prior over parameters are non-conjugate. This allows the application of the model in much wider contexts without restrictions. We present two different data generative models a linear GaussianGaussian model for real valued data and a linear Poisson-gamma model for count data. Encouraging transfer learning results are shown for two real world applications text modeling and content based image retrieval.

- **Summary**: Particle Filter is an effective solution to track objects in video sequences in complex situations. Its key idea is to estimate the density over the possible states of the object using a weighted sample whose elements are called particles. One of its crucial step is a resampling step in which particles are resampled to avoid some degeneracy problem. In this paper, we introduce a new resampling method called Combinatorial Resampling that exploits some features of articulated objects to resample over an implicitly created sample of an exponential size better representing the density to estimate. We prove that it is sound and, through experimentations both on challenging synthetic and real video sequences, we show that it outperforms all classical resampling methods both in terms of the quality of its results and in terms of response times.

- **Summary**: A tree-based dictionary learning model is developed for joint analysis of imagery and associated text. The dictionary learning may be applied directly to the imagery from patches, or to general feature vectors extracted from patches or superpixels (using any existing method for image feature extraction). Each image is associated with a path through the tree (from root to a leaf), and each of the multiple patches in a given image is associated with one node in that path. Nodes near the tree root are shared between multiple paths, representing image characteristics that are common among different types of images. Moving toward the leaves, nodes become specialized, representing details in image classes. If available, words (text) are also jointly modeled, with a path-dependent probability over words. The tree structure is inferred via a nested Dirichlet process, and a retrospective stick-breaking sampler is used to infer the tree depth and width.

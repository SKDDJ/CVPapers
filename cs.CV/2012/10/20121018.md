- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between convergence rate and computational cost when minimizing a composite functional with proximal-gradient methods, which are popular optimisation tools in machine learning. We consider the case when the proximity operator is computed via an iterative procedure, which provides an approximation of the exact proximity operator. In that case, we obtain algorithms with two nested loops. We show that the strategy that minimizes the computational cost to reach a solution with a desired accuracy in finite time is to set the number of inner iterations to a constant, which differs from the strategy indicated by a convergence rate analysis. In the process, we also present a new procedure called SIP (that is Speedy Inexact Proximal-gradient algorithm) that is both computationally efficient and easy to implement. Our numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and suggest that SIP can be a very competitive alternative to the standard procedure.

- **Summary**: Enabling users to interactively navigate through different viewpoints of a static scene is a new interesting functionality in 3D streaming systems. While it opens exciting perspectives towards rich multimedia applications, it requires the design of novel representations and coding techniques in order to solve the new challenges imposed by interactive navigation. Interactivity clearly brings new design constraints: the encoder is unaware of the exact decoding process, while the decoder has to reconstruct information from incomplete subsets of data since the server can generally not transmit images for all possible viewpoints due to resource constrains. In this paper, we propose a novel multiview data representation that permits to satisfy bandwidth and storage constraints in an interactive multiview streaming system. In particular, we partition the multiview navigation domain into segments, each of which is described by a reference image and some auxiliary information. The auxiliary information enables the client to recreate any viewpoint in the navigation segment via view synthesis. The decoder is then able to navigate freely in the segment without further data request to the server; it requests additional data only when it moves to a different segment. We discuss the benefits of this novel representation in interactive navigation systems and further propose a method to optimize the partitioning of the navigation domain into independent segments, under bandwidth and storage constraints. Experimental results confirm the potential of the proposed representation; namely, our system leads to similar compression performance as classical inter-view coding, while it provides the high level of flexibility that is required for interactive streaming. Hence, our new framework represents a promising solution for 3D data representation in novel interactive multimedia services.

- **Summary**: Counting circular objects such as cell colonies is an important source of information for biologists. Although this task is often time-consuming and subjective, it is still predominantly performed manually. The aim of the present work is to provide a new tool to enumerate circular objects from digital pictures and video streams. Here, I demonstrate that the created program, OpenCFU, is very robust, accurate and fast. In addition, it provides control over the processing parameters and is implemented in an in- tuitive and modern interface. OpenCFU is a cross-platform and open-source software freely available at http://opencfu.sourceforge.net.

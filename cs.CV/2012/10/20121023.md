- **Summary**: In this research paper we suggest how to extract a face from an image, modify it, characterize it in terms of high-level properties, and apply it to the creation of a personalized avatar. In this research work we tested, we implemented the algorithm on several hundred facial images, including many taken under uncontrolled acquisition conditions, and found to exhibit satisfactory performance for immediate practical use.

- **Summary**: Biometrics which use of human physiological characteristics for identifying an individual is now a widespread method of identification and authentication. Biometric identification is a technology which uses several image processing techniques and describes the general procedure for identification and verification using feature extraction, storage and matching from the digitized image of biometric characters such as Finger Print, Face, Iris or Palm Print. The current paper uses palm print biometrics. Here we have presented an identification approach using textural properties of palm print images. The elegance of the method is that the conventional edge detection technique is extended to suitably describe the texture features. In this technique all the characteristics of the palm such as principal lines, edges and wrinkles are considered with equal importance.

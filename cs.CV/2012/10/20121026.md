- **Summary**: Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and has many applications in image processing. This paper proposes a new approach for object detection by applying scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) in an automatic segmentation algorithm. SIFT is an invariant algorithm respect to scale, translation and rotation. The features are very distinct and provide stable keypoints that can be used for matching an object in different images. At first, an object is trained with different aspects for finding best keypoints. The object can be recognized in the other images by using achieved keypoints. Then, a robust segmentation algorithm is used to detect the object with full boundary based on SIFT keypoints. In segmentation algorithm, a merging role is defined to merge the regions in image with the assistance of keypoints. The results show that the proposed approach is reliable for object detection and can extract object boundary well.

- **Summary**: Inference is an integral part of probabilistic topic models, but is often non-trivial to derive an efficient algorithm for a specific model. It is even much more challenging when we want to find a fast inference algorithm which always yields sparse latent representations of documents. In this article, we introduce a simple framework for inference in probabilistic topic models, denoted by FW. This framework is general and flexible enough to be easily adapted to mixture models. It has a linear convergence rate, offers an easy way to incorporate prior knowledge, and provides us an easy way to directly trade off sparsity against quality and time. We demonstrate the goodness and flexibility of FW over existing inference methods by a number of tasks. Finally, we show how inference in topic models with nonconjugate priors can be done efficiently.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art discrete optimization methods struggle behind when it comes to challenging contrast-enhancing discrete energies (i.e., favoring different labels for neighboring variables). This work suggests a multiscale approach for these challenging problems. Deriving an algebraic representation allows us to coarsen any pair-wise energy using any interpolation in a principled algebraic manner. Furthermore, we propose an energy-aware interpolation operator that efficiently exposes the multiscale landscape of the energy yielding an effective coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. Results on challenging contrast-enhancing energies show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a new 3D face recognition method based on Speeded-Up Local Descriptor (SULD) of significant points extracted from the range images of faces. The proposed model consists of a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from range images of faces that can be used to perform reliable matching between different poses of range images of faces. For a given 3D face scan, range images are computed and the potential interest points are identified by searching at all scales. Based on the stability of the interest point, significant points are extracted. For each significant point we compute the SULD descriptor which consists of vector made of values from the convolved Haar wavelet responses located on concentric circles centred on the significant point, and where the amount of Gaussian smoothing is proportional to the radii of the circles. Experimental results show that the newly proposed method provides higher recognition rate compared to other existing contemporary models developed for 3D face recognition.

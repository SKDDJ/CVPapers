- **Summary**: The human brain processes information showing learning and prediction abilities but the underlying neuronal mechanisms still remain unknown. Recently, many studies prove that neuronal networks are able of both generalizations and associations of sensory inputs. In this paper, following a set of neurophysiological evidences, we propose a learning framework with a strong biological plausibility that mimics prominent functions of cortical circuitries. We developed the Inductive Conceptual Network (ICN), that is a hierarchical bio-inspired network, able to learn invariant patterns by Variable-order Markov Models implemented in its nodes. The outputs of the top-most node of ICN hierarchy, representing the highest input generalization, allow for automatic classification of inputs. We found that the ICN clusterized MNIST images with an error of 5.73% and USPS images with an error of 12.56%.

- **Summary**: Local Binary Descriptors are becoming more and more popular for image matching tasks, especially when going mobile. While they are extensively studied in this context, their ability to carry enough information in order to infer the original image is seldom addressed.   In this work, we leverage an inverse problem approach to show that it is possible to directly reconstruct the image content from Local Binary Descriptors. This process relies on very broad assumptions besides the knowledge of the pattern of the descriptor at hand. This generalizes previous results that required either a prior learning database or non-binarized features.   Furthermore, our reconstruction scheme reveals differences in the way different Local Binary Descriptors capture and encode image information. Hence, the potential applications of our work are multiple, ranging from privacy issues caused by eavesdropping image keypoints streamed by mobile devices to the design of better descriptors through the visualization and the analysis of their geometric content.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider the problem of manifold approximation with affine subspaces. Our objective is to discover a set of low dimensional affine subspaces that represents manifold data accurately while preserving the manifold's structure. For this purpose, we employ a greedy technique that partitions manifold samples into groups that can be each approximated by a low dimensional subspace. We start by considering each manifold sample as a different group and we use the difference of tangents to determine appropriate group mergings. We repeat this procedure until we reach the desired number of sample groups. The best low dimensional affine subspaces corresponding to the final groups constitute our approximate manifold representation. Our experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and show its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for manifold approximation.

- **Summary**: Segmentation-based image coding methods provide high compression ratios when compared with traditional image coding approaches like the transform and sub band coding for low bit-rate compression applications. In this paper, a segmentation-based image coding method, namely the Binary Space Partition scheme, that divides the desired image using a recursive procedure for coding is presented. The BSP approach partitions the desired image recursively by using bisecting lines, selected from a collection of discrete optional lines, in a hierarchical manner. This partitioning procedure generates a binary tree, which is referred to as the BSP-tree representation of the desired image. The algorithm is extremely complex in computation and has high execution time. The time complexity of the BSP scheme is explored in this work.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel technique to reconstruct 3D surface of an underwater object using stereo images. Reconstructing the 3D surface of an underwater object is really a challenging task due to degraded quality of underwater images. There are various reason of quality degradation of underwater images i.e., non-uniform illumination of light on the surface of objects, scattering and absorption effects. Floating particles present in underwater produces Gaussian noise on the captured underwater images which degrades the quality of images. The degraded underwater images are preprocessed by applying homomorphic, wavelet denoising and anisotropic filtering sequentially. The uncalibrated rectification technique is applied to preprocessed images to rectify the left and right images. The rectified left and right image lies on a common plane. To find the correspondence points in a left and right images, we have applied dense stereo matching technique i.e., graph cut method. Finally, we estimate the depth of images using triangulation technique. The experimental result shows that the proposed method reconstruct 3D surface of underwater objects accurately using captured underwater stereo images.

- **Summary**: This paper describes a method to localise all those areas which may constitute the date field in an Indian handwritten document. Spatial patterns of the date field are studied from various handwritten documents and an algorithm is developed through statistical analysis to identify those sets of connected components which may constitute the date. Common date patterns followed in India are considered to classify the date formats in different classes. Reported results demonstrate promising performance of the proposed approach

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a robust approach for text extraction and recognition from video clips which is called Neuro-Fuzzy system for Arabic Video OCR. In Arabic video text recognition, a number of noise components provide the text relatively more complicated to separate from the background. Further, the characters can be moving or presented in a diversity of colors, sizes and fonts that are not uniform. Added to this, is the fact that the background is usually moving making text extraction a more intricate process. Video include two kinds of text, scene text and artificial text. Scene text is usually text that becomes part of the scene itself as it is recorded at the time of filming the scene. But artificial text is produced separately and away from the scene and is laid over it at a later stage or during the post processing time. The emergence of artificial text is consequently vigilantly directed. This type of text carries with it important information that helps in video referencing, indexing and retrieval.

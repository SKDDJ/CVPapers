- **Summary**: Edge detection is one of the most critical tasks in automatic image analysis. There exists no universal edge detection method which works well under all conditions. This paper shows the new approach based on the one of the most efficient techniques for edge detection, which is entropy-based thresholding. The main advantages of the proposed method are its robustness and its flexibility. We present experimental results for this method, and compare results of the algorithm against several leading edge detection methods, such as Canny, LOG, and Sobel. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better result than some classic methods and the quality of the edge detector of the output images is robust and decrease the computation time.

- **Summary**: Edge detection is an important field in image processing. Edges characterize object boundaries and are therefore useful for segmentation, registration, feature extraction, and identification of objects in a scene. In this paper, an approach utilizing an improvement of Baljit and Amar method which uses Shannon entropy other than the evaluation of derivatives of the image in detecting edges in gray level images has been proposed. The proposed method can reduce the CPU time required for the edge detection process and the quality of the edge detector of the output images is robust. A standard test images, the real-world and synthetic images are used to compare the results of the proposed edge detector with the Baljit and Amar edge detector method. In order to validate the results, the run time of the proposed method and the pervious method are presented. It has been observed that the proposed edge detector works effectively for different gray scale digital images. The performance evaluation of the proposed technique in terms of the measured CPU time and the quality of edge detector method are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieve better result than the relevant classic method.

- **Summary**: A comparative study of the application of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) in biometric recognition of voice has been carried out and presented. The application of machine learning techniques to biometric authentication and recognition problems has gained a widespread acceptance. In this research, a GMM model was trained, using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, on a dataset containing 10 classes of vowels and the model was used to predict the appropriate classes using a validation dataset. For experimental validity, the model was compared to the performance of two different versions of RBF model using the same learning and validation datasets. The results showed very close recognition accuracy between the GMM and the standard RBF model, but with GMM performing better than the standard RBF by less than 1% and the two models outperformed similar models reported in literature. The DTREG version of RBF outperformed the other two models by producing 94.8% recognition accuracy. In terms of recognition time, the standard RBF was found to be the fastest among the three models.

- **Summary**: Digital watermarking is the process to hide digital pattern directly into a digital content. Digital watermarking techniques are used to address digital rights management, protect information and conceal secrets. An invisible non-blind watermarking approach for gray scale images is proposed in this paper. The host image is decomposed into 3-levels using Discrete Wavelet Transform. Based on the parent-child relationship between the wavelet coefficients the Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) compression algorithm is performed on the LH3, LH2, HL3 and HL2 subbands to find out the significant coefficients. The most significant coefficients of LH2 and HL2 bands are selected to embed a binary watermark image. The selected significant coefficients are modulated using Noise Visibility Function, which is considered as the best strength to ensure better imperceptibility. The approach is tested against various image processing attacks such as addition of noise, filtering, cropping, JPEG compression, histogram equalization and contrast adjustment. The experimental results reveal the high effectiveness of the method.

- **Summary**: Conceptualizing away the sketch processing details in a user interface will enable general users and domain experts to create more complex sketches. There are many domains for which sketch recognition systems are being developed. But they entail image-processing skill if they are to handle the details of each domain, and also they are lengthy to build. The implemented system goal is to enable user interface designers and domain experts who may not have proficiency in sketch recognition to be able to construct these sketch systems. This sketch recognition system takes in rough sketches from user drawn with the help of mouse as its input. It then recognizes the sketch using segmentation and domain classification, the properties of the user drawn sketch and segments are searched heuristically in the domains and each figures of each domain, and finally it shows its domain, the figure name and properties. It also draws the sketch smoothly. The work is resulted through extensive research and study of many existing image processing and pattern matching algorithms.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate a new compressive sensing model for multi-channel sparse data where each channel can be represented as a hierarchical tree and different channels are highly correlated. Therefore, the full data could follow the forest structure and we call this property as \emph{forest sparsity}. It exploits both intra- and inter- channel correlations and enriches the family of existing model-based compressive sensing theories. The proposed theory indicates that only $\mathcal{O}(Tk+\log(N/k))$ measurements are required for multi-channel data with forest sparsity, where $T$ is the number of channels, $N$ and $k$ are the length and sparsity number of each channel respectively. This result is much better than $\mathcal{O}(Tk+T\log(N/k))$ of tree sparsity, $\mathcal{O}(Tk+k\log(N/k))$ of joint sparsity, and far better than $\mathcal{O}(Tk+Tk\log(N/k))$ of standard sparsity. In addition, we extend the forest sparsity theory to the multiple measurement vectors problem, where the measurement matrix is a block-diagonal matrix. The result shows that the required measurement bound can be the same as that for dense random measurement matrix, when the data shares equal energy in each channel. A new algorithm is developed and applied on four example applications to validate the benefit of the proposed model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed theory and algorithm.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an effective method for fingerprint classification using data mining approach. Initially, it generates a numeric code sequence for each fingerprint image based on the ridge flow patterns. Then for each class, a seed is selected by using a frequent itemsets generation technique. These seeds are subsequently used for clustering the fingerprint images. The proposed method was tested and evaluated in terms of several real-life datasets and a significant improvement in reducing the misclassification errors has been noticed in comparison to its other counterparts.

- **Summary**: Content based video retrieval is an approach for facilitating the searching and browsing of large image collections over World Wide Web. In this approach, video analysis is conducted on low level visual properties extracted from video frame. We believed that in order to create an effective video retrieval system, visual perception must be taken into account. We conjectured that a technique which employs multiple features for indexing and retrieval would be more effective in the discrimination and search tasks of videos. In order to validate this claim, content based indexing and retrieval systems were implemented using color histogram, various texture features and other approaches. Videos were stored in Oracle 9i Database and a user study measured correctness of response.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses how to construct features for the problem of image correspondence, in particular, the paper addresses how to construct features so as to maintain the right level of invariance versus discriminability. We show that without additional prior knowledge of the 3D scene, the right tradeoff cannot be established in a pre-processing step of the images as is typically done in most feature-based matching methods. However, given knowledge of the second image to match, the tradeoff between invariance and discriminability of features in the first image is less ambiguous. This suggests to setup the problem of feature extraction and matching as a joint estimation problem. We develop a possible mathematical framework, a possible computational algorithm, and we give example demonstration on finding correspondence on images related by a scene that undergoes large 3D deformation of non-planar objects and camera viewpoint change.

- **Summary**: A basic assumption of statistical learning theory is that train and test data are drawn from the same underlying distribution. Unfortunately, this assumption doesn't hold in many applications. Instead, ample labeled data might exist in a particular `source' domain while inference is needed in another, `target' domain. Domain adaptation methods leverage labeled data from both domains to improve classification on unseen data in the target domain. In this work we survey domain transfer learning methods for various application domains with focus on recent work in Computer Vision.

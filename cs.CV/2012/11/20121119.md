- **Summary**: In this article, we address the issue of recovering latent transparent layers from superimposition images. Here, we assume we have the estimated transformations and extracted gradients of latent layers. To rapidly recover high-quality image layers, we propose an Efficient Superimposition Recovering Algorithm (ESRA) by extending the framework of accelerated gradient method. In addition, a key building block (in each iteration) in our proposed method is the proximal operator calculating. Here we propose to employ a dual approach and present our Parallel Algorithm with Constrained Total Variation (PACTV) method. Our recovering method not only reconstructs high-quality layers without color-bias problem, but also theoretically guarantees good convergence performance.

- **Summary**: Optical Character Recognition deals in recognition and classification of characters from an image. For the recognition to be accurate, certain topological and geometrical properties are calculated, based on which a character is classified and recognized. Also, the Human psychology perceives characters by its overall shape and features such as strokes, curves, protrusions, enclosures etc. These properties, also called Features are extracted from the image by means of spatial pixel-based calculation. A collection of such features, called Vectors, help in defining a character uniquely, by means of an Artificial Neural Network that uses these Feature Vectors.

- **Summary**: Depth image based rendering techniques for multiview applications have been recently introduced for efficient view generation at arbitrary camera positions. Encoding rate control has thus to consider both texture and depth data. Due to different structures of depth and texture images and their different roles on the rendered views, distributing the available bit budget between them however requires a careful analysis. Information loss due to texture coding affects the value of pixels in synthesized views while errors in depth information lead to shift in objects or unexpected patterns at their boundaries. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation between textures and depth data of multiview video sequences. We adopt a rate-distortion framework based on a simplified model of depth and texture images. Our model preserves the main features of depth and texture images. Unlike most recent solutions, our method permits to avoid rendering at encoding time for distortion estimation so that the encoding complexity is not augmented. In addition to this, our model is independent of the underlying inpainting method that is used at decoder. Experiments confirm our theoretical results and the efficiency of our rate allocation strategy.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an effective fingerprint classification method designed based on a hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique. The performance of the technique was evaluated in terms of several real-life datasets and a significant improvement in reducing the misclassification error has been noticed. This paper also presents a query based faster fingerprint search method over the clustered fingerprint databases. The retrieval accuracy of the search method has been found effective in light of several real-life databases.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we applied a dynamic model for manoeuvring targets in SIR particle filter algorithm for improving tracking accuracy of multiple manoeuvring targets. In our proposed approach, a color distribution model is used to detect changes of target's model . Our proposed approach controls deformation of target's model. If deformation of target's model is larger than a predetermined threshold, then the model will be updated. Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm is used as data association algorithm. We named our proposed method as Deformation Detection Particle Filter (DDPF) . DDPF approach is compared with basic SIR-PF algorithm on real airshow videos. Comparisons results show that, the basic SIR-PF algorithm is not able to track the manoeuvring targets when the rotation or scaling is occurred in target' s model. However, DDPF approach updates target's model when the rotation or scaling is occurred. Thus, the proposed approach is able to track the manoeuvring targets more efficiently and accurately.

- **Summary**: Data is compressed by reducing its redundancy, but this also makes the data less reliable, more prone to errors. In this paper a novel approach of image compression based on a new method that has been created for image compression which is called Five Modulus Method (FMM). The new method consists of converting each pixel value in an 8-by-8 block into a multiple of 5 for each of the R, G and B arrays. After that, the new values could be divided by 5 to get new values which are 6-bit length for each pixel and it is less in storage space than the original value which is 8-bits. Also, a new protocol for compression of the new values as a stream of bits has been presented that gives the opportunity to store and transfer the new compressed image easily.

- **Summary**: Because networks can be used to represent many complex systems, they have attracted considerable attention in physics, computer science, sociology, and many other disciplines. One of the most important areas of network science is the algorithmic detection of cohesive groups (i.e., "communities") of nodes. In this paper, we algorithmically detect communities in social networks and image data by optimizing multislice modularity. A key advantage of modularity optimization is that it does not require prior knowledge of the number or sizes of communities, and it is capable of finding network partitions that are composed of communities of different sizes. By optimizing multislice modularity and subsequently calculating diagnostics on the resulting network partitions, it is thereby possible to obtain information about network structure across multiple system scales. We illustrate this method on data from both social networks and images, and we find that optimization of multislice modularity performs well on these two tasks without the need for extensive problem-specific adaptation. However, improving the computational speed of this method remains a challenging open problem.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a new method is proposed for sparse PCA based on the recursive divide-and-conquer methodology. The main idea is to separate the original sparse PCA problem into a series of much simpler sub-problems, each having a closed-form solution. By recursively solving these sub-problems in an analytical way, an efficient algorithm is constructed to solve the sparse PCA problem. The algorithm only involves simple computations and is thus easy to implement. The proposed method can also be very easily extended to other sparse PCA problems with certain constraints, such as the nonnegative sparse PCA problem. Furthermore, we have shown that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the problem, and its computational complexity is approximately linear in both data size and dimensionality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is substantiated by extensive experiments implemented on a series of synthetic and real data in both reconstruction-error-minimization and data-variance-maximization viewpoints.

- **Summary**: Object Detection is the task of identifying the existence of an object class instance and locating it within an image. Difficulties in handling high intra-class variations constitute major obstacles to achieving high performance on standard benchmark datasets (scale, viewpoint, lighting conditions and orientation variations provide good examples). Suggested model aims at providing more robustness to detecting objects suffering severe distortion due to < 60{\deg} viewpoint changes. In addition, several model computational bottlenecks have been resolved leading to a significant increase in the model performance (speed and space) without compromising the resulting accuracy. Finally, we produced two illustrative applications showing the potential of the object detection technology being deployed in real life applications; namely content-based image search and content-based video search.

- **Summary**: As the use of biometrics becomes more wide-spread, the privacy concerns that stem from the use of biometrics are becoming more apparent. As the usage of mobile devices grows, so does the desire to implement biometric identification into such devices. A large majority of mobile devices being used are mobile phones. While work is being done to implement different types of biometrics into mobile phones, such as photo based biometrics, voice is a more natural choice. The idea of voice as a biometric identifier has been around a long time. One of the major concerns with using voice as an identifier is the instability of voice. We have developed a protocol that addresses those instabilities and preserves privacy. This paper describes a novel protocol that allows a user to authenticate using voice on a mobile/remote device without compromising their privacy. We first discuss the \vv protocol, which has recently been introduced in research literature, and then describe its limitations. We then introduce a novel adaptation and extension of the vaulted verification protocol to voice, dubbed $V^3$. Following that we show a performance evaluation and then conclude with a discussion of security and future work.

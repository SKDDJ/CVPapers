- **Summary**: On dedicated websites, people can upload videos and share it with the rest of the world. Currently these videos are cat- egorized manually by the help of the user community. In this paper, we propose a combination of color spaces with the Bayesian network approach for robust detection of skin color followed by an automated video categorization. Exper- imental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory performance for categorizing videos based on skin color.

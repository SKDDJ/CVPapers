- **Summary**: Most sparse linear representation-based trackers need to solve a computationally expensive L1-regularized optimization problem. To address this problem, we propose a visual tracker based on non-sparse linear representations, which admit an efficient closed-form solution without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, in order to capture the correlation information between different feature dimensions, we learn a Mahalanobis distance metric in an online fashion and incorporate the learned metric into the optimization problem for obtaining the linear representation. We show that online metric learning using proximity comparison significantly improves the robustness of the tracking, especially on those sequences exhibiting drastic appearance changes. Furthermore, in order to prevent the unbounded growth in the number of training samples for the metric learning, we design a time-weighted reservoir sampling method to maintain and update limited-sized foreground and background sample buffers for balancing sample diversity and adaptability. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.

- **Summary**: This article describes a fast iterative algorithm for image denoising and deconvolution with signal-dependent observation noise. We use an optimization strategy based on variable splitting that adapts traditional Gaussian noise-based restoration algorithms to account for the observed image being corrupted by mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise and quantization errors.

- **Summary**: A modular method was suggested before to recover a band limited signal from the sample and hold and linearly interpolated (or, in general, an nth-order-hold) version of the regular samples. In this paper a novel approach for compensating the distortion of any interpolation based on modular method has been proposed. In this method the performance of the modular method is optimized by adding only some simply calculated coefficients. This approach causes drastic improvement in terms of signal-to-noise ratios with fewer modules compared to the classical modular method. Simulation results clearly confirm the improvement of the proposed method and also its superior robustness against additive noise.

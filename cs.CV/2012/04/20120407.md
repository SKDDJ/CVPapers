- **Summary**: Gender is an important demographic attribute of people. This paper provides a survey of human gender recognition in computer vision. A review of approaches exploiting information from face and whole body (either from a still image or gait sequence) is presented. We highlight the challenges faced and survey the representative methods of these approaches. Based on the results, good performance have been achieved for datasets captured under controlled environments, but there is still much work that can be done to improve the robustness of gender recognition under real-life environments.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a Bayesian image segmentation algorithm based on finite mixtures. An EM algorithm is developed to estimate parameters of the Gaussian mixtures. The finite mixture is a flexible and powerful probabilistic modeling tool. It can be used to provide a model-based clustering in the field of pattern recognition. However, the application of finite mixtures to image segmentation presents some difficulties; especially it's sensible to noise. In this paper we propose a variant of this method which aims to resolve this problem. Our approach proceeds by the characterization of pixels by two features: the first one describes the intrinsic properties of the pixel and the second characterizes the neighborhood of pixel. Then the classification is made on the base on adaptive distance which privileges the one or the other features according to the spatial position of the pixel in the image. The obtained results have shown a significant improvement of our approach compared to the standard version of EM algorithm.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new approach based on augmented naive Bayes for image classification. Initially, each image is cutting in a whole of blocks. For each block, we compute a vector of descriptors. Then, we propose to carry out a classification of the vectors of descriptors to build a vector of labels for each image. Finally, we propose three variants of Bayesian Networks such as Naive Bayesian Network (NB), Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN) and Forest Augmented Naive Bayes (FAN) to classify the image using the vector of labels. The results showed a marked improvement over the FAN, NB and TAN.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an automatic analysis system for the Arabic handwriting postal addresses recognition, by using the beta elliptical model. Our system is divided into different steps: analysis, pre-processing and classification. The first operation is the filtering of image. In the second, we remove the border print, stamps and graphics. After locating the address on the envelope, the address segmentation allows the extraction of postal code and city name separately. The pre-processing system and the modeling approach are based on two basic steps. The first step is the extraction of the temporal order in the image of the handwritten trajectory. The second step is based on the use of Beta-Elliptical model for the representation of handwritten script. The recognition system is based on Graph-matching algorithm. Our modeling and recognition approaches were validated by using the postal code and city names extracted from the Tunisian postal envelopes data. The recognition rate obtained is about 98%.

- **Summary**: In a content based image classification system, target images are sorted by feature similarities with respect to the query (CBIR). In this paper, we propose to use new approach combining distance tangent, k-means algorithm and Bayesian network for image classification. First, we use the technique of tangent distance to calculate several tangent spaces representing the same image. The objective is to reduce the error in the classification phase. Second, we cut the image in a whole of blocks. For each block, we compute a vector of descriptors. Then, we use K-means to cluster the low-level features including color and texture information to build a vector of labels for each image. Finally, we apply five variants of Bayesian networks classifiers (Na\"ive Bayes, Global Tree Augmented Na\"ive Bayes (GTAN), Global Forest Augmented Na\"ive Bayes (GFAN), Tree Augmented Na\"ive Bayes for each class (TAN), and Forest Augmented Na\"ive Bayes for each class (FAN) to classify the image of faces using the vector of labels. In order to validate the feasibility and effectively, we compare the results of GFAN to FAN and to the others classifiers (NB, GTAN, TAN). The results demonstrate FAN outperforms than GFAN, NB, GTAN and TAN in the overall classification accuracy.

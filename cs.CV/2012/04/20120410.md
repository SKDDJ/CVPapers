- **Summary**: This paper proposes a neural network approach based on Error Back Propagation (EBP) for classification of different eye images. To reduce the complexity of layered neural network the dimensions of input vectors are optimized using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The main of this work is to provide for best method for feature extraction and classification. The details of this combined system named as SVD-EBP system, and results thereof are presented in this paper.   Keywords- Singular value decomposition(SVD), Error back Propagation(EBP).

- **Summary**: In this paper, an approach to the problem of automatic facial feature extraction from a still frontal posed image and classification and recognition of facial expression and hence emotion and mood of a person is presented. Feed forward back propagation neural network is used as a classifier for classifying the expressions of supplied face into seven basic categories like surprise, neutral, sad, disgust, fear, happy and angry. For face portion segmentation and localization, morphological image processing operations are used. Permanent facial features like eyebrows, eyes, mouth and nose are extracted using SUSAN edge detection operator, facial geometry, edge projection analysis. Experiments are carried out on JAFFE facial expression database and gives better performance in terms of 100% accuracy for training set and 95.26% accuracy for test set.

- **Summary**: Electronic toll collection (ETC) system has been a common trend used for toll collection on toll road nowadays. The implementation of electronic toll collection allows vehicles to travel at low or full speed during the toll payment, which help to avoid the traffic delay at toll road. One of the major components of an electronic toll collection is the automatic vehicle detection and classification (AVDC) system which is important to classify the vehicle so that the toll is charged according to the vehicle classes. Vision-based vehicle classification system is one type of vehicle classification system which adopt camera as the input sensing device for the system. This type of system has advantage over the rest for it is cost efficient as low cost camera is used. The implementation of vision-based vehicle classification system requires lower initial investment cost and very suitable for the toll collection trend migration in Malaysia from single ETC system to full-scale multi-lane free flow (MLFF). This project includes the development of an image-based vehicle classification system as an effort to seek for a robust vision-based vehicle classification system. The techniques used in the system include scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique, Canny's edge detector, K-means clustering as well as Euclidean distance matching. In this project, a unique way to image description as matching medium is proposed. This distinctiveness of method is analogous to the human DNA concept which is highly unique. The system is evaluated on open datasets and return promising results.

- **Summary**: The watershed is a powerful tool for segmenting objects whose contours appear as crest lines on a gradient image. The watershed transform associates to a topographic surface a partition into catchment basins, defined as attraction zones of a drop of water falling on the relief and following a line of steepest descent. Unfortunately, catchment basins may overlap and do not form a partition. Moreover, current watershed algorithms, being shortsighted, do not correctly estimate the steepness of the downwards trajectories and overestimate the overlapping zones of catchment basins. An arbitrary division of these zones between adjacent catchment basin results in a poor localization of the contours. We propose an algorithm without myopia, which considers the total length of a trajectory for estimating its steepness. We first consider topographic surfaces defined on node weighted graphs. The graphs are pruned in order to eliminate all downwards trajectories which are not the steepest. An iterative algorithm with simple neighborhood operations performs the pruning and constructs the catchment basins. The algorithm is then adapted to gray tone images. The graph structure itself is encoded as an image thanks to the fixed neighborhood structure of grids. A pair of adaptative erosions and dilations prune the graph and extend the catchment basins. As a result one obtains a precise detection of the catchment basins and a graph of the steepest trajectories. A last iterative algorithm allows to follow selected downwards trajectories in order to detect particular structures such as rivers or thalweg lines of the topographic surface.

- **Summary**: This paper present our new intensity chromaticity space-based feature detection and matching algorithm. This approach utilizes hybridization of wireless local area network and camera internal sensor which to receive signal strength from a access point and the same time retrieve interest point information from hallways. This information is combined by model fitting approach in order to find the absolute of user target position. No conventional searching algorithm is required, thus it is expected reducing the computational complexity. Finally we present pre-experimental results to illustrate the performance of the localization system for an indoor environment set-up.

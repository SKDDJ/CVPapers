- **Summary**: In this paper we present a spatially-adaptive method for image reconstruction that is based on the concept of statistical multiresolution estimation as introduced in [Frick K, Marnitz P, and Munk A. "Statistical multiresolution Dantzig estimation in imaging: Fundamental concepts and algorithmic framework". Electron. J. Stat., 6:231-268, 2012]. It constitutes a variational regularization technique that uses an supremum-type distance measure as data-fidelity combined with a convex cost functional. The resulting convex optimization problem is approached by a combination of an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers and Dykstra's projection algorithm. We describe a novel method for balancing data-fit and regularity that is fully automatic and allows for a sound statistical interpretation. The performance of our estimation approach is studied for various problems in imaging. Among others, this includes deconvolution problems that arise in Poisson nanoscale fluorescence microscopy.

- **Summary**: Exploiting a priori known structural information lies at the core of many image reconstruction methods that can be stated as inverse problems. The synthesis model, which assumes that images can be decomposed into a linear combination of very few atoms of some dictionary, is now a well established tool for the design of image reconstruction algorithms. An interesting alternative is the analysis model, where the signal is multiplied by an analysis operator and the outcome is assumed to be the sparse. This approach has only recently gained increasing interest. The quality of reconstruction methods based on an analysis model severely depends on the right choice of the suitable operator.   In this work, we present an algorithm for learning an analysis operator from training images. Our method is based on an $\ell_p$-norm minimization on the set of full rank matrices with normalized columns. We carefully introduce the employed conjugate gradient method on manifolds, and explain the underlying geometry of the constraints. Moreover, we compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods for image denoising, inpainting, and single image super-resolution. Our numerical results show competitive performance of our general approach in all presented applications compared to the specialized state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: This paper work directly towards the improving the quality of the image for the digital cameras and other visual capturing products. In this Paper, the authors clearly defines the problems occurs in the CFA image. A different methodology for removing the noise is discuses in the paper for color correction and color balancing of the image. At the same time, the authors also proposed a new methodology of providing denoisiing process before the demosaickingfor the improving the image quality of CFA which is much efficient then the other previous defined. The demosaicking process for producing the colors in the image in a best way is also discuss.

- **Summary**: Estimating pose of the head is an important preprocessing step in many pattern recognition and computer vision systems such as face recognition. Since the performance of the face recognition systems is greatly affected by the poses of the face, how to estimate the accurate pose of the face in human face image is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we represent a novel method for head pose estimation. To enhance the efficiency of the estimation we use contourlet transform for feature extraction. Contourlet transform is multi-resolution, multi-direction transform. In order to reduce the feature space dimension and obtain appropriate features we use LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to remove ineffcient features. Then, we apply different classifiers such as k-nearest neighborhood (knn) and minimum distance. We use the public available FERET database to evaluate the performance of proposed method. Simulation results indicate the superior robustness of the proposed method.

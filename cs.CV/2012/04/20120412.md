- **Summary**: The common internal structure and algorithmic organization of object detection, detection-based tracking, and event recognition facilitates a general approach to integrating these three components. This supports multidirectional information flow between these components allowing object detection to influence tracking and event recognition and event recognition to influence tracking and object detection. The performance of the combination can exceed the performance of the components in isolation. This can be done with linear asymptotic complexity.

- **Summary**: We present a system that produces sentential descriptions of video: who did what to whom, and where and how they did it. Action class is rendered as a verb, participant objects as noun phrases, properties of those objects as adjectival modifiers in those noun phrases,spatial relations between those participants as prepositional phrases, and characteristics of the event as prepositional-phrase adjuncts and adverbial modifiers. Extracting the information needed to render these linguistic entities requires an approach to event recognition that recovers object tracks, the track-to-role assignments, and changing body posture.

- **Summary**: We present a framework that allows an observer to determine occluded portions of a structure by finding the maximum-likelihood estimate of those occluded portions consistent with visible image evidence and a consistency model. Doing this requires determining which portions of the structure are occluded in the first place. Since each process relies on the other, we determine a solution to both problems in tandem. We extend our framework to determine confidence of one's assessment of which portions of an observed structure are occluded, and the estimate of that occluded structure, by determining the sensitivity of one's assessment to potential new observations. We further extend our framework to determine a robotic action whose execution would allow a new observation that would maximally increase one's confidence.

- **Summary**: We present an algebraic approach to the watershed adapted to edge or node weighted graphs. Starting with the flooding adjunction, we introduce the flooding graphs, for which node and edge weights may be deduced one from the other. Each node weighted or edge weighted graph may be transformed in a flooding graph, showing that there is no superiority in using one or the other, both being equivalent. We then introduce pruning operators extract subgraphs of increasing steepness. For an increasing steepness, the number of never ascending paths becomes smaller and smaller. This reduces the watershed zone, where catchment basins overlap. A last pruning operator called scissor associates to each node outside the regional minima one and only one edge. The catchment basins of this new graph do not overlap and form a watershed partition. Again, with an increasing steepness, the number of distinct watershed partitions contained in a graph becomes smaller and smaller. Ultimately, for natural image, an infinite steepness leads to a unique solution, as it is not likely that two absolutely identical non ascending paths of infinite steepness connect a node with two distinct minima. It happens that non ascending paths of a given steepness are the geodesics of lexicographic distance functions of a given depth. This permits to extract the watershed partitions as skeletons by zone of influence of the minima for such lexicographic distances. The waterfall hierarchy is obtained by a sequence of operations. The first constructs the minimum spanning forest which spans an initial watershed partition. The contraction of the trees into one node produces a reduced graph which may be submitted to the same treatment. The process is iterated until only one region remains. The union of the edges of all forests produced constitutes a minimum spanning tree of the initial graph.

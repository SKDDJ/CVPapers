- **Summary**: This article presents near-optimal guarantees for accurate and robust image recovery from under-sampled noisy measurements using total variation minimization. In particular, we show that from O(slog(N)) nonadaptive linear measurements, an image can be reconstructed to within the best s-term approximation of its gradient up to a logarithmic factor, and this factor can be removed by taking slightly more measurements. Along the way, we prove a strengthened Sobolev inequality for functions lying in the null space of suitably incoherent matrices.

- **Summary**: Three different algorithms used for eye pupil location were described and tested. Algorithm efficiency comparison was based on human faces images taken from the BioID database. Moreover all the eye localisation methods were implemented in a dedicated application supporting eye movement based computer control. In this case human face images were acquired by a webcam and processed in a real-time.

- **Summary**: 3D motion tracking is a critical task in many computer vision applications. Unsupervised markerless 3D motion tracking systems determine the most relevant object in the screen and then track it by continuously estimating its projection features (center and area) from the edge image and a point inside the relevant object projection (namely, inner point), until the tracking fails. Existing object projection feature estimation techniques are based on ray-casting from the inner point. These techniques present three main drawbacks: when the inner point is surrounded by edges, rays may not reach other relevant areas; as a consequence of that issue, the estimated features may greatly vary depending on the position of the inner point relative to the object projection; and finally, increasing the number of rays being casted and the ray-casting iterations (which would make the results more accurate and stable) increases the processing time to the point the tracking cannot be performed on the fly. In this paper, we analyze an intuitive filling-based object projection feature estimation technique that solves the aforementioned problems but is too sensitive to edge miscalculations. Then, we propose a less computing-intensive modification to that technique that would not be affected by the existing techniques issues and would be no more sensitive to edge miscalculations than ray-casting-based techniques.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the Discrete Wavelet based fusion techniques for combining perceptually important image features. SPIHT (Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees) algorithm is an efficient method for lossy and lossless coding of fused image. This paper presents some modifications on the SPIHT algorithm. It is based on the idea of insignificant correlation of wavelet coefficient among the medium and high frequency sub bands. In RE-MSPIHT algorithm, wavelet coefficients are scaled prior to SPIHT coding based on the sub band importance, with the goal of minimizing the MSE.

- **Summary**: The original contributions of this paper are twofold: a new understanding of the influence of noise on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian of a set of image patches, and an algorithm to estimate a denoised set of patches from a noisy image. The algorithm relies on the following two observations: (1) the low-index eigenvectors of the diffusion, or graph Laplacian, operators are very robust to random perturbations of the weights and random changes in the connections of the patch-graph; and (2) patches extracted from smooth regions of the image are organized along smooth low-dimensional structures in the patch-set, and therefore can be reconstructed with few eigenvectors. Experiments demonstrate that our denoising algorithm outperforms the denoising gold-standards.

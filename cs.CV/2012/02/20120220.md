- **Summary**: Recently the sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been proposed for robust face recognition (FR). In SRC, the testing image is coded as a sparse linear combination of the training samples, and the representation fidelity is measured by the l2-norm or l1-norm of the coding residual. Such a sparse coding model assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or Laplacian distribution, which may not be effective enough to describe the coding residual in practical FR systems. Meanwhile, the sparsity constraint on the coding coefficients makes SRC's computational cost very high. In this paper, we propose a new face coding model, namely regularized robust coding (RRC), which could robustly regress a given signal with regularized regression coefficients. By assuming that the coding residual and the coding coefficient are respectively independent and identically distributed, the RRC seeks for a maximum a posterior solution of the coding problem. An iteratively reweighted regularized robust coding (IR3C) algorithm is proposed to solve the RRC model efficiently. Extensive experiments on representative face databases demonstrate that the RRC is much more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art sparse representation based methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption, lighting and expression changes, etc.

- **Summary**: Color image segmentation is an important topic in the image processing field. MRF-MAP is often adopted in the unsupervised segmentation methods, but their performance are far behind recent interactive segmentation tools supervised by user inputs. Furthermore, the existing related unsupervised methods also suffer from the low efficiency, and high risk of being trapped in the local optima, because MRF-MAP is currently solved by iterative frameworks with inaccurate initial color distribution models. To address these problems, the letter designs an efficient method to calculate the energy functions approximately in the non-iteration style, and proposes a new binary segmentation algorithm based on the slightly tuned Lanczos eigensolver. The experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm achieves competitive performance compared with two state-of-art segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: The ability to characterize the color content of natural imagery is an important application of image processing. The pixel by pixel coloring of images may be viewed naturally as points in color space, and the inherent structure and distribution of these points affords a quantization, through clustering, of the color information in the image. In this paper, we present a novel topologically driven clustering algorithm that permits segmentation of the color features in a digital image. The algorithm blends Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and vector quantization by mapping color information to a lower dimensional space, identifying distinct color regions, and classifying pixels together based on both a proximity measure and color content. It is observed that these techniques permit a significant reduction in color resolution while maintaining the visually important features of images.

- **Summary**: In this work we review the basic principles of stochastic logic and propose its application to probabilistic-based pattern-recognition analysis. The proposed technique is intrinsically a parallel comparison of input data to various pre-stored categories using Bayesian techniques. We design smart pulse-based stochastic-logic blocks to provide an efficient pattern recognition analysis. The proposed rchitecture is applied to a specific navigation problem. The resulting system is orders of magnitude faster than processor-based solutions.

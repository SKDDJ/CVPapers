- **Summary**: In this paper a 4 x 4 Daubechies transform based authentication technique termed as SADT has been proposed to authenticate gray scale images. The cover image is transformed into the frequency domain using 4 x 4 mask in a row major order using Daubechies transform technique, resulting four frequency subbands AF, HF, VF and DF. One byte of every band in a mask is embedding with two or four bits of secret information. Experimental results are computed and compared with the existing authentication techniques like Li s method [5], SCDFT [6], Region-Based method [7] and other similar techniques based on Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Fidelity (IF), which shows better performance in SADT.

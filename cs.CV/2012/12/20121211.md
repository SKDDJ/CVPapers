- **Summary**: We introduce algorithms to visualize feature spaces used by object detectors. The tools in this paper allow a human to put on `HOG goggles' and perceive the visual world as a HOG based object detector sees it. We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector's failures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they do look deceptively similar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and indicates that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors. By visualizing feature spaces, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of our detection systems.

- **Summary**: Face recognition systems must be robust to the variation of various factors such as facial expression, illumination, head pose and aging. Especially, the robustness against illumination variation is one of the most important problems to be solved for the practical use of face recognition systems. Gabor wavelet is widely used in face detection and recognition because it gives the possibility to simulate the function of human visual system. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting Gabor wavelet features which is stable under the variation of local illumination and show experiment results demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: We present a novel framework for learning morphological operators using counter-harmonic mean. It combines concepts from morphology and convolutional neural networks. A thorough experimental validation analyzes basic morphological operators dilation and erosion, opening and closing, as well as the much more complex top-hat transform, for which we report a real-world application from the steel industry. Using online learning and stochastic gradient descent, our system learns both the structuring element and the composition of operators. It scales well to large datasets and online settings.

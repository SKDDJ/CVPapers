- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel image interpolation algorithm, which is formulated via combining both the local autoregressive (AR) model and the nonlocal adaptive 3-D sparse model as regularized constraints under the regularization framework. Estimating the high-resolution image by the local AR regularization is different from these conventional AR models, which weighted calculates the interpolation coefficients without considering the rough structural similarity between the low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images. Then the nonlocal adaptive 3-D sparse model is formulated to regularize the interpolated HR image, which provides a way to modify these pixels with the problem of numerical stability caused by AR model. In addition, a new Split-Bregman based iterative algorithm is developed to solve the above optimization problem iteratively. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvements over the traditional algorithms in terms of both objective quality and visual perception

- **Summary**: Learning Mahanalobis distance metrics in a high- dimensional feature space is very difficult especially when structural sparsity and low rank are enforced to improve com- putational efficiency in testing phase. This paper addresses both aspects by an ensemble metric learning approach that consists of sparse block diagonal metric ensembling and join- t metric learning as two consecutive steps. The former step pursues a highly sparse block diagonal metric by selecting effective feature groups while the latter one further exploits correlations between selected feature groups to obtain an accurate and low rank metric. Our algorithm considers all pairwise or triplet constraints generated from training samples with explicit class labels, and possesses good scala- bility with respect to increasing feature dimensionality and growing data volumes. Its applications to face verification and retrieval outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while retaining high efficiency.

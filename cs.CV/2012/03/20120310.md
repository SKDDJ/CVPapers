- **Summary**: Automatic speech processing systems are employed more and more often in real environments. Although the underlying speech technology is mostly language independent, differences between languages with respect to their structure and grammar have substantial effect on the recognition systems performance. In this paper, we present a review of the latest developments in the sign language recognition research in general and in the Arabic sign language (ArSL) in specific. This paper also presents a general framework for improving the deaf community communication with the hearing people that is called SignsWorld. The overall goal of the SignsWorld project is to develop a vision-based technology for recognizing and translating continuous Arabic sign language ArSL.

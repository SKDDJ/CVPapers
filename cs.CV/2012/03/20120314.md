- **Summary**: The probability hypothesis density (PHD) and multi-target multi-Bernoulli (MeMBer) filters are two leading algorithms that have emerged from random finite sets (RFS). In this paper we study a method which combines these two approaches. Our work is motivated by a sister paper, which proves that the full Bayes RFS filter naturally incorporates a Poisson component representing targets that have never been detected, and a linear combination of multi-Bernoulli components representing targets under track. Here we demonstrate the benefit (in speed of track initiation) that maintenance of a Poisson component of undetected targets provides. Subsequently, we propose a method of recycling, which projects Bernoulli components with a low probability of existence onto the Poisson component (as opposed to deleting them). We show that this allows us to achieve similar tracking performance using a fraction of the number of Bernoulli components (i.e., tracks).

- **Summary**: Recent developments in random finite sets (RFSs) have yielded a variety of tracking methods that avoid data association. This paper derives a form of the full Bayes RFS filter and observes that data association is implicitly present, in a data structure similar to MHT. Subsequently, algorithms are obtained by approximating the distribution of associations. Two algorithms result: one nearly identical to JIPDA, and another related to the MeMBer filter. Both improve performance in challenging environments.

- **Summary**: A method to obtain three-dimensional data of real-world objects by integrating their material properties is presented. The material properties are defined by capturing the Reflectance Fields of the real-world objects. It is shown, unlike conventional reconstruction methods, the method is able to use the reflectance information to recover surface depth for objects having a non-Lambertian surface reflectance. It is, for recovering 3D data of objects exhibiting an anisotropic BRDF with an error less than 0.3%.

- **Summary**: In real world everything is an object which represents particular classes. Every object can be fully described by its attributes. Any real world dataset contains large number of attributes and objects. Classifiers give poor performance when these huge datasets are given as input to it for proper classification. So from these huge dataset most useful attributes need to be extracted that contribute the maximum to the decision. In the paper, attribute set is reduced by generating reducts using the indiscernibility relation of Rough Set Theory (RST). The method measures similarity among the attributes using relative indiscernibility relation and computes attribute similarity set. Then the set is minimized and an attribute similarity table is constructed from which attribute similar to maximum number of attributes is selected so that the resultant minimum set of selected attributes (called reduct) cover all attributes of the attribute similarity table. The method has been applied on glass dataset collected from the UCI repository and the classification accuracy is calculated by various classifiers. The result shows the efficiency of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Marker-based motion capture (MoCap) systems can be composed by several dozens of cameras with the purpose of reconstructing the trajectories of hundreds of targets. With a large amount of cameras it becomes interesting to determine the optimal reconstruction strategy. For such aim it is of fundamental importance to understand the information provided by different camera measurements and how they are combined, i.e. how the reconstruction error changes by considering different cameras. In this work, first, an approximation of the reconstruction error variance is derived. The results obtained in some simulations suggest that the proposed strategy allows to obtain a good approximation of the real error variance with significant reduction of the computational time.

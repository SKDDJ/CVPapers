- **Summary**: The appearance of microcalcifications in mammograms is one of the early signs of breast cancer. So, early detection of microcalcification clusters (MCCs) in mammograms can be helpful for cancer diagnosis and better treatment of breast cancer. In this paper a computer method has been proposed to support radiologists in detection MCCs in digital mammography. First, in order to facilitate and improve the detection step, mammogram images have been enhanced with wavelet transformation and morphology operation. Then for segmentation of suspicious MCCs, two methods have been investigated. The considered methods are: adaptive threshold and watershed segmentation. Finally, the detected MCCs areas in different algorithms will be compared to find out which segmentation method is more appropriate for extracting MCCs in mammograms.

- **Summary**: A resistive memory network that has no crossover wiring is proposed to overcome the hardware limitations to size and functional complexity that is associated with conventional analogue neural networks. The proposed memory network is based on simple network cells that are arranged in a hierarchical modular architecture. Cognitive functionality of this network is demonstrated by an example of character recognition. The network is trained by an evolutionary process to completely recognise characters deformed by random noise, rotation, scaling and shifting

- **Summary**: Feature selection is an important problem in high-dimensional data analysis and classification. Conventional feature selection approaches focus on detecting the features based on a redundancy criterion using learning and feature searching schemes. In contrast, we present an approach that identifies the need to select features based on their discriminatory ability among classes. Area of overlap between inter-class and intra-class distances resulting from feature to feature comparison of an attribute is used as a measure of discriminatory ability of the feature. A set of nearest attributes in a pattern having the lowest area of overlap within a degree of tolerance defined by a selection threshold is selected to represent the best available discriminable features. State of the art recognition results are reported for pattern classification problems by using the proposed feature selection scheme with the nearest neighbour classifier. These results are reported with benchmark databases having high dimensional feature vectors in the problems involving images and micro array data.

- **Summary**: Examplers of a face are formed from multiple gallery images of a person and are used in the process of classification of a test image. We incorporate such examplers in forming a biologically inspired local binary decisions on similarity based face recognition method. As opposed to single model approaches such as face averages the exampler based approach results in higher recognition accu- racies and stability. Using multiple training samples per person, the method shows the following recognition accuracies: 99.0% on AR, 99.5% on FERET, 99.5% on ORL, 99.3% on EYALE, 100.0% on YALE and 100.0% on CALTECH face databases. In addition to face recognition, the method also detects the natural variability in the face images which can find application in automatic tagging of face images.

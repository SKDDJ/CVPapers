- **Summary**: Shape is one of the most important visual attributes to characterize objects, playing a important role in pattern recognition. There are various approaches to extract relevant information of a shape. An approach widely used in shape analysis is the complexity, and Fractal Dimension and Multi-Scale Fractal Dimension are both well-known methodologies to estimate it. This papers presents a comparative study between Fractal Dimension and Multi-Scale Fractal Dimension in a shape analysis context. Through experimental comparison using a shape database previously classified, both methods are compared. Different parameters configuration of each method are considered and a discussion about the results of each method is also presented.

- **Summary**: The use of hierarchical Conditional Random Field model deal with the problem of labeling images . At the time of labeling a new image, selection of the nearest cluster and using the related CRF model to label this image. When one give input image, one first use the CRF model to get initial pixel labels then finding the cluster with most similar images. Then at last relabeling the input image by the CRF model associated with this cluster. This paper presents a approach to label and segment specific image having correct information.

- **Summary**: 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an emerging field in image processing and computer vision that aims to create 3D visualizations/ models of objects/ scenes from image sets. However, its commercial applications and benefits are yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we describe ongoing work towards assessing the value of 3D reconstruction in the building construction domain. We present preliminary results from a user study, where our objective is to understand the use of visual information in building construction in order to determine problems with the use of visual information and identify potential benefits and scenarios for the use of 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: The calculus of variations applied to the image processing requires some numerical models able to perform the variations of images and the extremization of appropriate actions. To produce the variations of images, there are several possibilities based on the brightness maps. Before a numerical model, I propose an experimental approach, based on a tool of Gimp, GNU Image Manipulation Program, in order to visualize how the image variations can be. After the discussion of this tool, which is able to strongly increase the visibility of images, the variations and a possible functional for the visibility are proposed in the framework of a numerical model. The visibility functional is analogous to the fringe visibility of the optical interference.

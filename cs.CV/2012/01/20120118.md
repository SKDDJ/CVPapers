- **Summary**: Recent results in Compressive Sensing have shown that, under certain conditions, the solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations with sparsity-based regularization can be accurately recovered by solving convex relaxations of the original problem. In this work, we present a novel primal-dual analysis on a class of sparsity minimization problems. We show that the Lagrangian bidual (i.e., the Lagrangian dual of the Lagrangian dual) of the sparsity minimization problems can be used to derive interesting convex relaxations: the bidual of the $\ell_0$-minimization problem is the $\ell_1$-minimization problem; and the bidual of the $\ell_{0,1}$-minimization problem for enforcing group sparsity on structured data is the $\ell_{1,\infty}$-minimization problem. The analysis provides a means to compute per-instance non-trivial lower bounds on the (group) sparsity of the desired solutions. In a real-world application, the bidual relaxation improves the performance of a sparsity-based classification framework applied to robust face recognition.

- **Summary**: Essentially a biometric system is a pattern recognition system which recognizes a user by determining the authenticity of a specific anatomical or behavioral characteristic possessed by the user. With the ever increasing integration of computers and Internet into daily life style, it has become necessary to protect sensitive and personal data. This paper proposes a multimodal biometric system which incorporates more than one biometric trait to attain higher security and to handle failure to enroll situations for some users. This paper is aimed at investigating a multimodal biometric identity system using Linear Discriminant Analysis as backbone to both facial and speech recognition and implementing such system in real-time using SignalWAVE.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel, learning-based, two-step super-resolution (SR) algorithm well suited to solve the specially demanding problem of obtaining SR estimates from short image sequences. The first step, devoted to increase the sampling rate of the incoming images, is performed by fitting linear combinations of functions generated from principal components (PC) to reproduce locally the sparse projected image data, and using these models to estimate image values at nodes of the high-resolution grid. PCs were obtained from local image patches sampled at sub-pixel level, which were generated in turn from a database of high-resolution images by application of a physically realistic observation model. Continuity between local image models is enforced by minimizing an adequate functional in the space of model coefficients. The second step, dealing with restoration, is performed by a linear filter with coefficients learned to restore residual interpolation artifacts in addition to low-resolution blurring, providing an effective coupling between both steps of the method. Results on a demanding five-image scanned sequence of graphics and text are presented, showing the excellent performance of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art two-step and Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori SR algorithms.

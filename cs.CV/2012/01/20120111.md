- **Summary**: In this paper we develop the theory of parametric polynomial regression in Riemannian manifolds and Lie groups. We show application of Riemannian polynomial regression to shape analysis in Kendall shape space. Results are presented, showing the power of polynomial regression on the classic rat skull growth data of Bookstein as well as the analysis of the shape changes associated with aging of the corpus callosum from the OASIS Alzheimer's study.

- **Summary**: This paper suggests a nonparametric scheme to find the sparse solution of the underdetermined system of linear equations in the presence of unknown impulsive or non-Gaussian noise. This approach is robust against any variations of the noise model and its parameters. It is based on minimization of rank pseudo norm of the residual signal and l_1-norm of the signal of interest, simultaneously. We use the steepest descent method to find the sparse solution via an iterative algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the existence methods like OMP, BP, Lasso, and BCS whenever the observation vector is contaminated with measurement or environmental non-Gaussian noise with unknown parameters. Furthermore, for low SNR condition, the proposed method has better performance in the presence of Gaussian noise.

- **Summary**: Solving the Maximum a Posteriori on Markov Random Field, MRF-MAP, is a prevailing method in recent interactive image segmentation tools. Although mathematically explicit in its computational targets, and impressive for the segmentation quality, MRF-MAP is hard to accomplish without the interactive information from users. So it is rarely adopted in the automatic style up to today. In this paper, we present an automatic image segmentation algorithm, NegCut, based on the approximation to MRF-MAP. First we prove MRF-MAP is NP-hard when the probabilistic models are unknown, and then present an approximation function in the form of minimum cuts on graphs with negative weights. Finally, the binary segmentation is taken from the largest eigenvector of the target matrix, with a tuned version of the Lanczos eigensolver. It is shown competitive at the segmentation quality in our experiments.

- **Summary**: It has recently been observed that certain extremely simple feature encoding techniques are able to achieve state of the art performance on several standard image classification benchmarks including deep belief networks, convolutional nets, factored RBMs, mcRBMs, convolutional RBMs, sparse autoencoders and several others. Moreover, these "triangle" or "soft threshold" encodings are ex- tremely efficient to compute. Several intuitive arguments have been put forward to explain this remarkable performance, yet no mathematical justification has been offered.   The main result of this report is to show that these features are realized as an approximate solution to the a non-negative sparse coding problem. Using this connection we describe several variants of the soft threshold features and demonstrate their effectiveness on two image classification benchmark tasks.

- **Summary**: Human activities comprise several sub-activities performed in a sequence and involve interactions with various objects. This makes reasoning about the object affordances a central task for activity recognition. In this work, we consider the problem of jointly labeling the object affordances and human activities from RGB-D videos. We frame the problem as a Markov Random Field where the nodes represent objects and sub-activities, and the edges represent the relationships between object affordances, their relations with sub-activities, and their evolution over time. We formulate the learning problem using a structural SVM approach, where labeling over various alternate temporal segmentations are considered as latent variables. We tested our method on a dataset comprising 120 activity videos collected from four subjects, and obtained an end-to-end precision of 81.8% and recall of 80.0% for labeling the activities.

- **Summary**: Many applications require comparing multimodal data with different structure and dimensionality that cannot be compared directly. Recently, there has been increasing interest in methods for learning and efficiently representing such multimodal similarity. In this paper, we present a simple algorithm for multimodal similarity-preserving hashing, trying to map multimodal data into the Hamming space while preserving the intra- and inter-modal similarities. We show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the field.

- **Summary**: Iris recognition is considered as one of the best biometric methods used for human identification and verification, this is because of its unique features that differ from one person to another, and its importance in the security field. This paper proposes an algorithm for iris recognition and classification using a system based on Local Binary Pattern and histogram properties as a statistical approaches for feature extraction, and Combined Learning Vector Quantization Classifier as Neural Network approach for classification, in order to build a hybrid model depends on both features. The localization and segmentation techniques are presented using both Canny edge detection and Hough Circular Transform in order to isolate an iris from the whole eye image and for noise detection .Feature vectors results from LBP is applied to a Combined LVQ classifier with different classes to determine the minimum acceptable performance, and the result is based on majority voting among several LVQ classifier. Different iris datasets CASIA, MMU1, MMU2, and LEI with different extensions and size are presented. Since LBP is working on a grayscale level so colored iris images should be transformed into a grayscale level. The proposed system gives a high recognition rate 99.87 % on different iris datasets compared with other methods.

- **Summary**: Object detection and classification using video is necessary for intelligent planning and navigation on a mobile robot. However, current methods can be too slow or not sufficient for distinguishing multiple classes. Techniques that rely on binary (foreground/background) labels incorrectly identify areas with multiple overlapping objects as single segment. We propose two Hierarchical Markov Random Field models in efforts to distinguish connected objects using tiered, binary label sets. Near-realtime performance has been achieved using efficient optimization methods which runs up to 11 frames per second on a dual core 2.2 Ghz processor. Evaluation of both models is done using footage taken from a robot obstacle course at the 2010 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition.

- **Summary**: The recent technological progress in acquisition, modeling and processing of 3D data leads to the proliferation of a large number of 3D objects databases. Consequently, the techniques used for content based 3D retrieval has become necessary. In this paper, we introduce a new method for 3D objects recognition and retrieval by using a set of binary images CLI (Characteristic level images). We propose a 3D indexing and search approach based on the similarity between characteristic level images using Hu moments for it indexing. To measure the similarity between 3D objects we compute the Hausdorff distance between a vectors descriptor. The performance of this new approach is evaluated at set of 3D object of well known database, is NTU (National Taiwan University) database.

- **Summary**: In this paper a novel approach is proposed based on single Euler number feature which is free from thinning and size normalization for multi-font and multi-size Kannada numeral recognition system. A nearest neighbor classification is used for classification of Kannada numerals by considering the Euclidian distance. A total 1500 numeral images with different font sizes between (10..84) are tested for algorithm efficiency and the overall the classification accuracy is found to be 99.00% .The said method is thinning free, fast, and showed encouraging results on varying font styles and sizes of Kannada numerals.

- **Summary**: In this paper a fast and novel method is proposed for multi-font multi-size Kannada numeral recognition which is thinning free and without size normalization approach. The different structural feature are used for numeral recognition namely, directional density of pixels in four directions, water reservoirs, maximum profile distances, and fill hole density are used for the recognition of Kannada numerals. A Euclidian minimum distance criterion is used to find minimum distances and K-nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify the Kannada numerals by varying the size of numeral image from 16 to 50 font sizes for the 20 different font styles from NUDI and BARAHA popular word processing Kannada software. The total 1150 numeral images are tested and the overall accuracy of classification is found to be 100%. The average time taken by this method is 0.1476 seconds.

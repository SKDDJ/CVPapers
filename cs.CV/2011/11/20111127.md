- **Summary**: A simple approach for orthogonal wavelets in compressed sensing (CS) applications is presented. We compare efficient algorithm for different orthogonal wavelet measurement matrices in CS for image processing from scanned photographic plates (SPP). Some important characteristics were obtained for astronomical image processing of SPP. The best orthogonal wavelet choice for measurement matrix construction in CS for image compression of images of SPP is given. The image quality measure for linear and nonlinear image compression method is defined.

- **Summary**: The Ward error sum of squares hierarchical clustering method has been very widely used since its first description by Ward in a 1963 publication. It has also been generalized in various ways. However there are different interpretations in the literature and there are different implementations of the Ward agglomerative algorithm in commonly used software systems, including differing expressions of the agglomerative criterion. Our survey work and case studies will be useful for all those involved in developing software for data analysis using Ward's hierarchical clustering method.

- **Summary**: Discontinuity preserving smoothing is a fundamentally important procedure that is useful in a wide variety of image processing contexts. It is directly useful for noise reduction, and frequently used as an intermediate step in higher level algorithms. For example, it can be particularly useful in edge detection and segmentation. Three well known algorithms for discontinuity preserving smoothing are nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, bilateral filtering, and mean shift filtering. Although slight differences make them each better suited to different tasks, all are designed to preserve discontinuities while smoothing. However, none of them satisfy this goal perfectly: they each have exception cases in which smoothing may occur across hard edges. The principal contribution of this paper is the identification of a property we call edge awareness that should be satisfied by any discontinuity preserving smoothing algorithm. This constraint can be incorporated into existing algorithms to improve quality, and usually has negligible changes in runtime performance and/or complexity. We present modifications necessary to augment diffusion and mean shift, as well as a new formulation of the bilateral filter that unifies the spatial and range spaces to achieve edge awareness.

- **Summary**: The fundamental matrix and trifocal tensor are convenient algebraic representations of the epipolar geometry of two and three view configurations, respectively. The estimation of these entities is central to most reconstruction algorithms, and a solid understanding of their properties and constraints is therefore very important. The fundamental matrix has 1 internal constraint which is well understood, whereas the trifocal tensor has 8 independent algebraic constraints. The internal tensor constraints can be represented in many ways, although there is only one minimal and sufficient set of 8 constraints known. In this paper, we derive a second set of minimal and sufficient constraints that is simpler. We also show how this can be used in a new parameterization of the trifocal tensor. We hope that this increased understanding of the internal constraints may lead to improved algorithms for estimating the trifocal tensor, although the primary contribution is an improved theoretical understanding.

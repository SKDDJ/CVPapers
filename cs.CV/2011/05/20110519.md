- **Summary**: We give a new algorithmic solution to the well-known five-point relative pose problem. Our approach does not deal with the famous cubic constraint on an essential matrix. Instead, we use the Cayley representation of rotations in order to obtain a polynomial system from epipolar constraints. Solving that system, we directly get relative rotation and translation parameters of the cameras in terms of roots of a 10th degree polynomial.

- **Summary**: To date, the histogram-based running median filter of Perreault and H\'ebert is considered the fastest for 8-bit images, being roughly O(1) in average case. We present here another approximately constant time algorithm which further improves the aforementioned one and exhibits lower associated constant, being at the time of writing the lowest theoretical complexity algorithm for calculation of 2D and higher dimensional median filters. The algorithm scales naturally to higher precision (e.g. 16-bit) integer data without any modifications. Its adaptive version offers additional speed-up for images showing compact modes in gray-value distribution. The experimental comparison to the previous constant-time algorithm defines the application domain of this new development, besides theoretical interest, as high bit depth data and/or hardware without SIMD extensions. The C/C++ implementation of the algorithm is available under GPL for research purposes.

- **Journal**: C. Dalitz (Ed.): "Document Image Analysis with the Gamera
  Framework." Schriftenreihe des Fachbereichs Elektrotechnik und Informatik,
  Hochschule Niederrhein, vol. 8, pp.5-15, Shaker Verlag (2009)
- **Summary**: This article describes JECT-OMR, a system that analyzes digital images representing scans of multiple-choice tests compiled by students. The system performs a structural analysis of the document in order to get the chosen answer for each question, and it also contains a bar-code decoder, used for the identification of additional information encoded in the document. JECT-OMR was implemented using the Python programming language, and leverages the power of the Gamera framework in order to accomplish its task. The system exhibits an accuracy of over 99% in the recognition of marked and non-marked squares representing answers, thus making it suitable for real world applications

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a shape-based, time-scale invariant feature descriptor for 1-D sensor signals. The time-scale invariance of the feature allows us to use feature from one training event to describe events of the same semantic class which may take place over varying time scales such as walking slow and walking fast. Therefore it requires less training set. The descriptor takes advantage of the invariant location detection in the scale space theory and employs a high level shape encoding scheme to capture invariant local features of events. Based on this descriptor, a scale-invariant classifier with "R" metric (SIC-R) is designed to recognize multi-scale events of human activities. The R metric combines the number of matches of keypoint in scale space with the Dynamic Time Warping score. SICR is tested on various types of 1-D sensors data from passive infrared, accelerometer and seismic sensors with more than 90% classification accuracy.

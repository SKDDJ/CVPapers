- **Summary**: It is argued that for the computer to be able to interact with humans, it needs to have the communication skills of humans. One of these skills is the ability to understand the emotional state of the person. This thesis describes a neural network-based approach for emotion classification. We learn a classifier that can recognize six basic emotions with an average accuracy of 77% over the Cohn-Kanade database. The novelty of this work is that instead of empirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning rate, activation function parameter, momentum number, the number of nodes in one layer, etc. we developed a strategy that can automatically select comparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another way to perform back propagation. Instead of using the partial differential of the error function, we use optimal algorithm; namely Powell's direction set to minimize the error function. We were also interested in construction an authentic emotion databases. This is a very important task because nowadays there is no such database available. Finally, we perform several experiments and show that our neural network approach can be successfully used for emotion recognition.

- **Summary**: This work discusses preliminary work aimed at simulating and visualizing the growth process of a tiny structure inside the cell---the microtubule. Difficulty of recording the process lies in the fact that the tissue preparation method for electronic microscopes is highly destructive to live cells. Here in this paper, our approach is to take pictures of microtubules at different time slots and then appropriately combine these images into a coherent video. Experimental results are given on real data.

- **Comment**: V1: 14 pages, 11 figures. V2: 16 Pages, 15 figures. The
  non-parametric model of the system is compared with a parametric model of the
  system operation. Added 2-sample KS-Test for evaluating the profile update
  mechanism. Latency in detection decisions was allowed, and parameters
  configurations tuned accordingly. Same Conclusions. The effect of network
  activity on system profiles is analyzed

- **Summary**: WLAN Device-free passive DfP indoor localization is an emerging technology enabling the localization of entities that do not carry any devices nor participate actively in the localization process using the already installed wireless infrastructure. This technology is useful for a variety of applications such as intrusion detection, smart homes and border protection. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of RASID, a DfP system for human motion detection. RASID combines different modules for statistical anomaly detection while adapting to changes in the environment to provide accurate, robust, and low-overhead detection of human activities using standard WiFi hardware. Evaluation of the system in two different testbeds shows that it can achieve an accurate detection capability in both environments with an F-measure of at least 0.93. In addition, the high accuracy and low overhead performance are robust to changes in the environment as compared to the current state of the art DfP detection systems. We also relay the lessons learned during building our system and discuss future research directions.

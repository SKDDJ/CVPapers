- **Summary**: This paper constructs translation invariant operators on L2(R^d), which are Lipschitz continuous to the action of diffeomorphisms. A scattering propagator is a path ordered product of non-linear and non-commuting operators, each of which computes the modulus of a wavelet transform. A local integration defines a windowed scattering transform, which is proved to be Lipschitz continuous to the action of diffeomorphisms. As the window size increases, it converges to a wavelet scattering transform which is translation invariant. Scattering coefficients also provide representations of stationary processes. Expected values depend upon high order moments and can discriminate processes having the same power spectrum. Scattering operators are extended on L2 (G), where G is a compact Lie group, and are invariant under the action of G. Combining a scattering on L2(R^d) and on Ld (SO(d)) defines a translation and rotation invariant scattering on L2(R^d).

- **Summary**: In this work, the possibilities for segmentation of cells from their background and each other in digital image were tested, combined and improoved. Lot of images with young, adult and mixture cells were able to prove the quality of described algorithms. Proper segmentation is one of the main task of image analysis and steps order differ from work to work, depending on input images. Reply for biologicaly given question was looking for in this work, including filtration, details emphasizing, segmentation and sphericity computing. Order of algorithms and way to searching for them was also described. Some questions and ideas for further work were mentioned in the conclusion part.

- **Summary**: In this paper we compare the use of several features in the task of content filtering for video social networks, a very challenging task, not only because the unwanted content is related to very high-level semantic concepts (e.g., pornography, violence, etc.) but also because videos from social networks are extremely assorted, preventing the use of constrained a priori information. We propose a simple method, able to combine diverse evidence, coming from different features and various video elements (entire video, shots, frames, keyframes, etc.). We evaluate our method in three social network applications, related to the detection of unwanted content - pornographic videos, violent videos, and videos posted to artificially manipulate popularity scores. Using challenging test databases, we show that this simple scheme is able to obtain good results, provided that adequate features are chosen. Moreover, we establish a representation using codebooks of spatiotemporal local descriptors as critical to the success of the method in all three contexts. This is consequential, since the state-of-the-art still relies heavily on static features for the tasks addressed.

- **Summary**: The box counting method for fractal dimension estimation had not been applied to large or colour images thus far due to the processing time required. In this letter we present a fast, easy to implement and very easily expandable to any number of dimensions variation, the box merging method. It is applied here in RGB images which are considered as sets in 5-D space.

- **Summary**: We describe a novel binary classification technique called Banded SVM (B-SVM). In the standard C-SVM formulation of Cortes et al. (1995), the decision rule is encouraged to lie in the interval [1, \infty]. The new B-SVM objective function contains a penalty term that encourages the decision rule to lie in a user specified range [\rho_1, \rho_2]. In addition to the standard set of support vectors (SVs) near the class boundaries, B-SVM results in a second set of SVs in the interior of each class.

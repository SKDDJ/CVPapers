- **Summary**: We propose a traffic congestion estimation system based on unsupervised on-line learning algorithm. The system does not rely on background extraction or motion detection. It extracts local features inside detection regions of variable size which are drawn on lanes in advance. The extracted features are then clustered into two classes using K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM). A Bayes classifier is used to detect vehicles according to the previous cluster information which keeps updated whenever system is running by on-line EM algorithm. Experimental result shows that our system can be adapted to various traffic scenes for estimating traffic status.

- **Summary**: This paper presents multi-font/multi-size Kannada numerals and vowels recognition based on spatial features. Directional spatial features viz stroke density, stroke length and the number of stokes in an image are employed as potential features to characterize the printed Kannada numerals and vowels. Based on these features 1100 numerals and 1400 vowels are classified with Multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed system achieves the recognition accuracy as 98.45% and 90.64% for numerals and vowels respectively.

- **Summary**: Common estimation algorithms, such as least squares estimation or the Kalman filter, operate on a state in a state space S that is represented as a real-valued vector. However, for many quantities, most notably orientations in 3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a vector space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For integrating these quantities, several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.   Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of the manifold S is encapsulated by two operators, state displacement [+]:S x R^n --> S and its inverse [-]: S x S --> R^n. These operators provide a local vector-space view \delta; --> x [+] \delta; around a given state x. Generic estimation algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing +/- with [+]/[-] where appropriate. We analyze these operators axiomatically, and demonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the Unscented Kalman Filter. Moreover, we exploit the idea of encapsulation from a software engineering perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the [+]/[-] operators mediate between a "flat-vector" view for the generic algorithm and a "named-members" view for the problem specific functions.

- **Summary**: Template-based signal detection most often relies on computing a correlation, or a dot product, between an incoming data stream and a signal template. Such a correlation results in an ongoing estimate of the magnitude of the signal in the data stream. However, it does not directly indicate the presence or absence of the signal. The problem is really one of model-testing, and the relevant quantity is the Bayesian evidence (marginal likelihood) of the signal model. Given a signal template and an ongoing data stream, we have developed an evidence-based filter that computes the Bayesian evidence that a signal is present in the data. We demonstrate this algorithm by applying it to brain-machine interface (BMI) data obtained by recording human brain electrical activity, or electroencephalography (EEG). A very popular and effective paradigm in EEG-based BMI is based on the detection of the P300 evoked brain response which is generated in response to particular sensory stimuli. The goal is to detect the presence of a P300 signal in ongoing EEG activity as accurately and as fast as possible. Our algorithm uses a subject-specific P300 template to compute the Bayesian evidence that a applying window of EEG data contains the signal. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated by comparing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the evidence-based filter to the usual correlation method. Our results show a significant improvement in single-trial P300 detection. The evidence-based filter promises to improve the accuracy and speed of the detection of evoked brain responses in BMI applications as well the detection of template signals in more general signal processing applications

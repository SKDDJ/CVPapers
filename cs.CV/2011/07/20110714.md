- **Summary**: Feature selection and extraction plays an important role in different classification based problems such as face recognition, signature verification, optical character recognition (OCR) etc. The performance of OCR highly depends on the proper selection and extraction of feature set. In this paper, we present novel features based on the topography of a character as visible from different viewing directions on a 2D plane. By topography of a character we mean the structural features of the strokes and their spatial relations. In this work we develop topographic features of strokes visible with respect to views from different directions (e.g. North, South, East, and West). We consider three types of topographic features: closed region, convexity of strokes, and straight line strokes. These features are represented as a shape-based graph which acts as an invariant feature set for discriminating very similar type characters efficiently. We have tested the proposed method on printed and handwritten Bengali and Hindi character images. Initial results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

- **Summary**: Face recognition has been studied extensively for more than 20 years now. Since the beginning of 90s the subject has became a major issue. This technology is used in many important real-world applications, such as video surveillance, smart cards, database security, internet and intranet access. This report reviews recent two algorithms for face recognition which take advantage of a relatively new multiscale geometric analysis tool - Curvelet transform, for facial processing and feature extraction. This transform proves to be efficient especially due to its good ability to detect curves and lines, which characterize the human's face. An algorithm which is based on the two algorithms mentioned above is proposed, and its performance is evaluated on three data bases of faces: AT&T (ORL), Essex Grimace and Georgia-Tech. k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) and Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. This algorithm shows good results, and it even outperforms other algorithms in some cases.

- **Summary**: Segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels). Such common segmentation tasks including segmenting written text or segmenting tumors from healthy brain tissue in an MRI image, etc. Chan-Vese model for active contours is a powerful and flexible method which is able to segment many types of images, including some that would be quite difficult to segment in means of "classical" segmentation - i.e., using thresholding or gradient based methods. This model is based on the Mumford-Shah functional for segmentation, and is used widely in the medical imaging field, especially for the segmentation of the brain, heart and trachea. The model is based on an energy minimization problem, which can be reformulated in the level set formulation, leading to an easier way to solve the problem. In this project, the model will be presented (there is an extension to color (vector-valued) images, but it will not be considered here), and Matlab code that implements it will be introduced.

- **Summary**: We analyse the potential of Gibbs Random Fields for shape prior modelling. We show that the expressive power of second order GRFs is already sufficient to express simple shapes and spatial relations between them simultaneously. This allows to model and recognise complex shapes as spatial compositions of simpler parts.

- **Summary**: Recently many research efforts have been devoted to image annotation by leveraging on the associated tags/keywords of web images as training labels. A key issue to resolve is the relatively low accuracy of the tags. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-automatic framework to construct a more accurate and effective training set from these web media resources for each label that we want to learn. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the constructed training set can result in higher accuracy for image annotation.

- **Summary**: Multiview geometry is the study of two-dimensional images of three-dimensional scenes, a foundational subject in computer vision. We determine a universal Groebner basis for the multiview ideal of n generic cameras. As the cameras move, the multiview varieties vary in a family of dimension 11n-15. This family is the distinguished component of a multigraded Hilbert scheme with a unique Borel-fixed point. We present a combinatorial study of ideals lying on that Hilbert scheme.

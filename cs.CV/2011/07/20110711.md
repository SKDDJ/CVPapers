- **Summary**: The Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager is an instrument, specially designed for investigation of the wave processes in the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere. In order to determine the kinematic parameters of a wave, the values of a physical quantity in different space points and their changes in the time should be known. As a result of the possibilities of the SATI instrument for space scanning, different parts of the images (sectors of spectrograms) correspond to the respective mesopause areas (where the radiation is generated). An approach is proposed for sector spectra determination from SATI images based on ordered statistics instead of meaning. Comparative results are shown.

- **Summary**: This paper reviews Kunchenko's polynomials using as template matching method to recognize template in one-dimensional input signal. Kunchenko's polynomials method is compared with classical methods - cross-correlation and sum of squared differences according to numerical statistical example.

- **Summary**: Using a vehicle toy (in next future called vehicle) as a moving object an automatic road lighting system (ARLS) model is constructed. A digital video camera with 25 fps is used to capture the vehicle motion as it moves in the test segment of the road. Captured images are then processed to calculate vehicle speed. This information of the speed together with position of vehicle is then used to control the lighting system along the path that passes by the vehicle. Length of the road test segment is 1 m, the video camera is positioned about 1.1 m above the test segment, and the vehicle toy dimension is 13 cm \times 9.3 cm. In this model, the maximum speed that ARLS can handle is about 1.32 m/s, and the highest performance is obtained about 91% at speed 0.93 m/s.

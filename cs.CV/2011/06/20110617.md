- **Summary**: This paper presents a comparative study of two different methods, which are based on fusion and polar transformation of visual and thermal images. Here, investigation is done to handle the challenges of face recognition, which include pose variations, changes in facial expression, partial occlusions, variations in illumination, rotation through different angles, change in scale etc. To overcome these obstacles we have implemented and thoroughly examined two different fusion techniques through rigorous experimentation. In the first method log-polar transformation is applied to the fused images obtained after fusion of visual and thermal images whereas in second method fusion is applied on log-polar transformed individual visual and thermal images. After this step, which is thus obtained in one form or another, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce dimension of the fused images. Log-polar transformed images are capable of handling complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. The main objective of employing fusion is to produce a fused image that provides more detailed and reliable information, which is capable to overcome the drawbacks present in the individual visual and thermal face images. Finally, those reduced fused images are classified using a multilayer perceptron neural network. The database used for the experiments conducted here is Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark thermal and visual face images. The second method has shown better performance, which is 95.71% (maximum) and on an average 93.81% as correct recognition rate.

- **Summary**: This paper demonstrates two different fusion techniques at two different levels of a human face recognition process. The first one is called data fusion at lower level and the second one is the decision fusion towards the end of the recognition process. At first a data fusion is applied on visual and corresponding thermal images to generate fused image. Data fusion is implemented in the wavelet domain after decomposing the images through Daubechies wavelet coefficients (db2). During the data fusion maximum of approximate and other three details coefficients are merged together. After that Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is applied over the fused coefficients and finally two different artificial neural networks namely Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) and Radial Basis Function(RBF) networks have been used separately to classify the images. After that, for decision fusion based decisions from both the classifiers are combined together using Bayesian formulation. For experiments, IRIS thermal/visible Face Database has been used. Experimental results show that the performance of multiple classifier system along with decision fusion works well over the single classifier system.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a technique by which high-intensity feature vectors extracted from the Gabor wavelet transformation of frontal face images, is combined together with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for enhanced face recognition. Firstly, the high-intensity feature vectors are automatically extracted using the local characteristics of each individual face from the Gabor transformed images. Then ICA is applied on these locally extracted high-intensity feature vectors of the facial images to obtain the independent high intensity feature (IHIF) vectors. These IHIF forms the basis of the work. Finally, the image classification is done using these IHIF vectors, which are considered as representatives of the images. The importance behind implementing ICA along with the high-intensity features of Gabor wavelet transformation is twofold. On the one hand, selecting peaks of the Gabor transformed face images exhibit strong characteristics of spatial locality, scale, and orientation selectivity. Thus these images produce salient local features that are most suitable for face recognition. On the other hand, as the ICA employs locally salient features from the high informative facial parts, it reduces redundancy and represents independent features explicitly. These independent features are most useful for subsequent facial discrimination and associative recall. The efficiency of IHIF method is demonstrated by the experiment on frontal facial images dataset, selected from the FERET, FRAV2D, and the ORL database.

- **Summary**: Forensic applications like criminal investigations, terrorist identification and National security issues require a strong fingerprint data base and efficient identification system. In this paper we propose DWT based Fingerprint Recognition using Non Minutiae (DWTFR) algorithm. Fingerprint image is decomposed into multi resolution sub bands of LL, LH, HL and HH by applying 3 level DWT. The Dominant local orientation angle {\theta} and Coherence are computed on LL band only. The Centre Area Features and Edge Parameters are determined on each DWT level by considering all four sub bands. The comparison of test fingerprint with database fingerprint is decided based on the Euclidean Distance of all the features. It is observed that the values of FAR, FRR and TSR are improved compared to the existing algorithm.

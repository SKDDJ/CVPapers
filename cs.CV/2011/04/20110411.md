- **Summary**: In this paper we present clustering method is very sensitive to the initial center values, requirements on the data set too high, and cannot handle noisy data the proposal method is using information entropy to initialize the cluster centers and introduce weighting parameters to adjust the location of cluster centers and noise problems.The navigation datasets which are sequential in nature, Clustering web data is finding the groups which share common interests and behavior by analyzing the data collected in the web servers, this improves clustering on web data efficiently using improved fuzzy c-means(FCM) clustering. Web usage mining is the application of data mining techniques to web log data repositories. It is used in finding the user access patterns from web access log. Web data Clusters are formed using on MSNBC web navigation dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a new method for offline handwritten signature retrieval is based on curvelet transform is proposed. Many applications in image processing require similarity retrieval of an image from a large collection of images. In such cases, image indexing becomes important for efficient organization and retrieval of images. This paper addresses this issue in the context of a database of handwritten signature images and describes a system for similarity retrieval. The proposed system uses a curvelet based texture features extraction. The performance of the system has been tested with an image database of 180 signatures. The results obtained indicate that the proposed system is able to identify signatures with great with accuracy even when a part of a signature is missing.

- **Summary**: Template matching is one of the most prevalent pattern recognition methods worldwide. It has found uses in most visual concept detection fields. In this work, we investigate methods for improving template matching by adjusting the weights of different regions of the template. We compare several weight maps and test the methods using the FERET face test set in the context of human eye detection.

- **Summary**: The main goal of the GEOMIR2K9 project is to create a software program that is able to find similar scenic images clustered by geographical location and sorted by similarity based only on their visual content. The user should be able to input a query image, based on this given query image the program should find relevant visual content and present this to the user in a meaningful way. Technically the goal for the GEOMIR2K9 project is twofold. The first of these two goals is to create a basic low level visual information retrieval system. This includes feature extraction, post processing of the feature data and classification/ clustering based on similarity with a strong focus on scenic images. The second goal of this project is to provide the user with a novel and suitable interface and visualization method so that the user may interact with the retrieved images in a natural and meaningful way.

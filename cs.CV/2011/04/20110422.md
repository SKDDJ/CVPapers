- **Summary**: In conventional target tracking systems, human operators use the estimated target tracks to make higher level inference of the target behaviour/intent. This paper develops syntactic filtering algorithms that assist human operators by extracting spatial patterns from target tracks to identify suspicious/anomalous spatial trajectories. The targets' spatial trajectories are modeled by a stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) and a switched mode state space model. Bayesian filtering algorithms for stochastic context free grammars are presented for extracting the syntactic structure and illustrated for a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar example. The performance of the algorithms is tested with the experimental data collected using DRDC Ottawa's X-band Wideband Experimental Airborne Radar (XWEAR).

- **Summary**: Statistical dependencies among wavelet coefficients are commonly represented by graphical models such as hidden Markov trees(HMTs). However, in linear inverse problems such as deconvolution, tomography, and compressed sensing, the presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently. We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as lasso.

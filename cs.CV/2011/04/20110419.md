- **Summary**: Despite the recent developments in spatiotemporal local features for action recognition in video sequences, local color information has so far been ignored. However, color has been proved an important element to the success of automated recognition of objects and scenes. In this paper we extend the space-time interest point descriptor STIP to take into account the color information on the features' neighborhood. We compare the performance of our color-aware version of STIP (which we have called HueSTIP) with the original one.

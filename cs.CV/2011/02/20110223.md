- **Summary**: We propose a novel probabilistic method for detection of objects in noisy images. The method uses results from percolation and random graph theories. We present an algorithm that allows to detect objects of unknown shapes in the presence of random noise. Our procedure substantially differs from wavelets-based algorithms. The algorithm has linear complexity and exponential accuracy and is appropriate for real-time systems. We prove results on consistency and algorithmic complexity of our procedure.

- **Summary**: In the series of our earlier papers on the subject, we proposed a novel statistical hypothesis testing method for detection of objects in noisy images. The method uses results from percolation theory and random graph theory. We developed algorithms that allowed to detect objects of unknown shapes in the presence of nonparametric noise of unknown level and of unknown distribution. No boundary shape constraints were imposed on the objects, only a weak bulk condition for the object's interior was required. Our algorithms have linear complexity and exponential accuracy. In the present paper, we describe an implementation of our nonparametric hypothesis testing method. We provide a program that can be used for statistical experiments in image processing. This program is written in the statistical programming language R.

- **Summary**: Connections created from a node-edge matrix have been traditionally difficult to visualize and analyze because of the number of flows to be rendered in a limited feature or cartographic space. Because analyzing connectivity patterns is useful for understanding the complex dynamics of human and information flow that connect non-adjacent space, techniques that allow for visual data mining or static representations of system dynamics are a growing field of research. Here, we create a Weighted Radial Variation (WRV) technique to classify a set of nodes based on the configuration of their radially-emanating vector flows. Each entity's vector is syncopated in terms of cardinality, direction, length, and flow magnitude. The WRV process unravels each star-like entity's individual flow vectors on a 0-360{\deg} spectrum, to form a unique signal whose distribution depends on the flow presence at each step around the entity, and is further characterized by flow distance and magnitude. The signals are processed with an unsupervised classification method that clusters entities with similar signatures in order to provide a typology for each node in the system of spatial flows. We use a case study of U.S. county-to-county human incoming and outgoing migration data to test our method.

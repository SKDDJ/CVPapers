- **Summary**: Chernoff information upper bounds the probability of error of the optimal Bayesian decision rule for $2$-class classification problems. However, it turns out that in practice the Chernoff bound is hard to calculate or even approximate. In statistics, many usual distributions, such as Gaussians, Poissons or frequency histograms called multinomials, can be handled in the unified framework of exponential families. In this note, we prove that the Chernoff information for members of the same exponential family can be either derived analytically in closed form, or efficiently approximated using a simple geodesic bisection optimization technique based on an exact geometric characterization of the "Chernoff point" on the underlying statistical manifold.

- **Summary**: This study is focused on the development of the cortex-like visual object recognition system. We propose a general framework, which consists of three hierarchical levels (modules). These modules functionally correspond to the V1, V4 and IT areas. Both bottom-up and top-down connections between the hierarchical levels V4 and IT are employed. The higher the degree of matching between the input and the preferred stimulus, the shorter the response time of the neuron. Therefore information about a single stimulus is distributed in time and is transmitted by the waves of spikes. The reciprocal connections and waves of spikes implement predictive coding: an initial hypothesis is generated on the basis of information delivered by the first wave of spikes and is tested with the information carried by the consecutive waves. The development is considered as extraction and accumulation of features in V4 and objects in IT. Once stored a feature can be disposed, if rarely activated. This cause update of feature repository. Consequently, objects in IT are also updated. This illustrates the growing process and dynamical change of topological structures of V4, IT and connections between these areas.

- **Summary**: There is an increasing use of some imperceivable and redundant local features for face recognition. While only a relatively small fraction of them is relevant to the final recognition task, the feature selection is a crucial and necessary step to select the most discriminant ones to obtain a compact face representation. In this paper, we investigate the sparsity-enforced regularization-based feature selection methods and propose a multi-task feature selection method for building person specific models for face verification. We assume that the person specific models share a common subset of features and novelly reformulated the common subset selection problem as a simultaneous sparse approximation problem. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to apply the sparsity-enforced regularization methods for person specific face verification. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified with the challenging LFW face databases.

- **Summary**: Inspired by biological vision systems, the over-complete local features with huge cardinality are increasingly used for face recognition during the last decades. Accordingly, feature selection has become more and more important and plays a critical role for face data description and recognition. In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel age estimation method based on GLOH feature descriptor and multi-task learning (MTL). The GLOH feature descriptor, one of the state-of-the-art feature descriptor, is used to capture the age-related local and spatial information of face image. As the exacted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative feature bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.

- **Summary**: We describe an approach for segmenting an image into regions that correspond to surfaces in the scene that are partially surrounded by the medium. It integrates both appearance and motion statistics into a cost functional, that is seeded with occluded regions and minimized efficiently by solving a linear programming problem. Where a short observation time is insufficient to determine whether the object is detachable, the results of the minimization can be used to seed a more costly optimization based on a longer sequence of video data. The result is an entirely unsupervised scheme to detect and segment an arbitrary and unknown number of objects. We test our scheme to highlight the potential, as well as limitations, of our approach.

- **Summary**: This contribution proposes a new approach towards developing a class of probabilistic methods for classifying attributed graphs. The key concept is random attributed graph, which is defined as an attributed graph whose nodes and edges are annotated by random variables. Every node/edge has two random processes associated with it- occurence probability and the probability distribution over the attribute values. These are estimated within the maximum likelihood framework. The likelihood of a random attributed graph to generate an outcome graph is used as a feature for classification. The proposed approach is fast and robust to noise.

- **Summary**: Motivated by an emerging theory of robust low-rank matrix representation, in this paper, we introduce a novel solution for online rigid-body motion registration. The goal is to develop algorithmic techniques that enable a robust, real-time motion registration solution suitable for low-cost, portable 3-D camera devices. Assuming 3-D image features are tracked via a standard tracker, the algorithm first utilizes Robust PCA to initialize a low-rank shape representation of the rigid body. Robust PCA finds the global optimal solution of the initialization, while its complexity is comparable to singular value decomposition. In the online update stage, we propose a more efficient algorithm for sparse subspace projection to sequentially project new feature observations onto the shape subspace. The lightweight update stage guarantees the real-time performance of the solution while maintaining good registration even when the image sequence is contaminated by noise, gross data corruption, outlying features, and missing data. The state-of-the-art accuracy of the solution is validated through extensive simulation and a real-world experiment, while the system enjoys one to two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to well-established RANSAC solutions. The new algorithm will be released online to aid peer evaluation.

- **Summary**: A patch-based non-local restoration and reconstruction method for preprocessing degraded document images is introduced. The method collects relative data from the whole input image, while the image data are first represented by a content-level descriptor based on patches. This patch-equivalent representation of the input image is then corrected based on similar patches identified using a modified genetic algorithm (GA) resulting in a low computational load. The corrected patch-equivalent is then converted to the output restored image. The fact that the method uses the patches at the content level allows it to incorporate high-level restoration in an objective and self-sufficient way. The method has been applied to several degraded document images, including the DIBCO'09 contest dataset with promising results.

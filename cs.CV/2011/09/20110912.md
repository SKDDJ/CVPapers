- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a new multiple instance learning (MIL) method, called MIS-Boost, which learns discriminative instance prototypes by explicit instance selection in a boosting framework. Unlike previous instance selection based MIL methods, we do not restrict the prototypes to a discrete set of training instances but allow them to take arbitrary values in the instance feature space. We also do not restrict the total number of prototypes and the number of selected-instances per bag; these quantities are completely data-driven. We show that MIS-Boost outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods on a number of benchmark datasets. We also apply MIS-Boost to large-scale image classification, where we show that the automatically selected prototypes map to visually meaningful image regions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of discriminative dictionary learning (DDL), where sparse linear representation and classification are combined in a probabilistic framework. As such, a single discriminative dictionary and linear binary classifiers are learned jointly. By encoding sparse representation and discriminative classification models in a MAP setting, we propose a general optimization framework that allows for a data-driven tradeoff between faithful representation and accurate classification. As opposed to previous work, our learning methodology is capable of incorporating a diverse family of classification cost functions (including those used in popular boosting methods), while avoiding the need for involved optimization techniques. We show that DDL can be solved by a sequence of updates that make use of well-known and well-studied sparse coding and dictionary learning algorithms from the literature. To validate our DDL framework, we apply it to digit classification and face recognition and test it on standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We present an approach for the joint segmentation and grouping of similar components in anisotropic 3D image data and use it to segment neural tissue in serial sections electron microscopy (EM) images.   We first construct a nested set of neuron segmentation hypotheses for each slice. A conditional random field (CRF) then allows us to evaluate both the compatibility of a specific segmentation and a specific inter-slice assignment of neuron candidates with the underlying observations. The model is solved optimally for an entire image stack simultaneously using integer linear programming (ILP), which yields the maximum a posteriori solution in amortized linear time in the number of slices.   We evaluate the performance of our approach on an annotated sample of the Drosophila larva neuropil and show that the consideration of different segmentation hypotheses in each slice leads to a significant improvement in the segmentation and assignment accuracy.

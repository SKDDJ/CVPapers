- **Summary**: Many computer vision and image processing problems can be posed as solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, designing PDE system usually requires high mathematical skills and good insight into the problems. In this paper, we consider designing PDEs for various problems arising in computer vision and image processing in a lazy manner: \emph{learning PDEs from real data via data-based optimal control}. We first propose a general intelligent PDE system which holds the basic translational and rotational invariance rule for most vision problems. By introducing a PDE-constrained optimal control framework, it is possible to use the training data resulting from multiple ways (ground truth, results from other methods, and manual results from humans) to learn PDEs for different computer vision tasks. The proposed optimal control based training framework aims at learning a PDE-based regressor to approximate the unknown (and usually nonlinear) mapping of different vision tasks. The experimental results show that the learnt PDEs can solve different vision problems reasonably well. In particular, we can obtain PDEs not only for problems that traditional PDEs work well but also for problems that PDE-based methods have never been tried before, due to the difficulty in describing those problems in a mathematical way.

- **Summary**: The research work presented in this paper is to achieve the tissue classification and automatically diagnosis the abnormal tumor region present in Computed Tomography (CT) images using the wavelet based statistical texture analysis method. Comparative studies of texture analysis method are performed for the proposed wavelet based texture analysis method and Spatial Gray Level Dependence Method (SGLDM). Our proposed system consists of four phases i) Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (ii) Feature extraction (iii) Feature selection (iv) Analysis of extracted texture features by classifier. A wavelet based statistical texture feature set is derived from normal and tumor regions. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select the optimal texture features from the set of extracted texture features. We construct the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier and evaluate the performance of classifier by comparing the classification results of the SVM based classifier with the Back Propagation Neural network classifier(BPN). The results of Support Vector Machine (SVM), BPN classifiers for the texture analysis methods are evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of SVM is 96% for 10 fold cross validation method. The system has been tested with a number of real Computed Tomography brain images and has achieved satisfactory results.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a simple, automatic and efficient clustering algorithm, namely, Automatic Merging for Optimal Clusters (AMOC) which aims to generate nearly optimal clusters for the given datasets automatically. The AMOC is an extension to standard k-means with a two phase iterative procedure combining certain validation techniques in order to find optimal clusters with automation of merging of clusters. Experiments on both synthetic and real data have proved that the proposed algorithm finds nearly optimal clustering structures in terms of number of clusters, compactness and separation.

- **Summary**: Texture classification became one of the problems which has been paid much attention on by image processing scientists since late 80s. Consequently, since now many different methods have been proposed to solve this problem. In most of these methods the researchers attempted to describe and discriminate textures based on linear and non-linear patterns. The linear and non-linear patterns on any window are based on formation of Grain Components in a particular order. Grain component is a primitive unit of morphology that most meaningful information often appears in the form of occurrence of that. The approach which is proposed in this paper could analyze the texture based on its grain components and then by making grain components histogram and extracting statistical features from that would classify the textures. Finally, to increase the accuracy of classification, proposed approach is expanded to color images to utilize the ability of approach in analyzing each RGB channels, individually. Although, this approach is a general one and it could be used in different applications, the method has been tested on the stone texture and the results can prove the quality of approach.

- **Summary**: In this work, we prove several relations between three different energy minimization techniques. A recently proposed methods for determining a provably optimal partial assignment of variables by Ivan Kovtun (IK), the linear programming relaxation approach (LP) and the popular expansion move algorithm by Yuri Boykov. We propose a novel sufficient condition of optimal partial assignment, which is based on LP relaxation and called LP-autarky. We show that methods of Kovtun, which build auxiliary submodular problems, fulfill this sufficient condition. The following link is thus established: LP relaxation cannot be tightened by IK. For non-submodular problems this is a non-trivial result. In the case of two labels, LP relaxation provides optimal partial assignment, known as persistency, which, as we show, dominates IK. Relating IK with expansion move, we show that the set of fixed points of expansion move with any "truncation" rule for the initial problem and the problem restricted by one-vs-all method of IK would coincide -- i.e. expansion move cannot be improved by this method. In the case of two labels, expansion move with a particular truncation rule coincide with one-vs-all method.

- **Summary**: The recent advances in 3-D imaging technologies give rise to databases of human shapes, from which statistical shape models can be built. These statistical models represent prior knowledge of the human shape and enable us to solve shape reconstruction problems from partial information. Generating human shape from traditional anthropometric measurements is such a problem, since these 1-D measurements encode 3-D shape information. Combined with a statistical shape model, these easy-to-obtain measurements can be leveraged to create 3D human shapes. However, existing methods limit the creation of the shapes to the space spanned by the database and thus require a large amount of training data. In this paper, we introduce a technique that extrapolates the statistically inferred shape to fit the measurement data using nonlinear optimization. This method ensures that the generated shape is both human-like and satisfies the measurement conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and compare it to existing approaches through extensive experiments, using both synthetic data and real human measurements.

- **Summary**: Document segmentation is one of the critical phases in machine recognition of any language. Correct segmentation of individual symbols decides the accuracy of character recognition technique. It is used to decompose image of a sequence of characters into sub images of individual symbols by segmenting lines and words. Devnagari is the most popular script in India. It is used for writing Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit and Nepali languages. Moreover, Hindi is the third most popular language in the world. Devnagari documents consist of vowels, consonants and various modifiers. Hence proper segmentation of Devnagari word is challenging. A simple histogram based approach to segment Devnagari documents is proposed in this paper. Various challenges in segmentation of Devnagari script are also discussed.

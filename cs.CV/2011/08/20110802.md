- **Summary**: Fingertips detection has been used in many applications, and it is very popular and commonly used in the area of Human Computer Interaction these days. This paper presents a novel time efficient method that will lead to fingertip detection after cropping the irrelevant parts of input image. Binary silhouette of the input image is generated using HSV color space based skin filter and hand cropping done based on histogram of the hand image. The cropped image will be used to figure out the fingertips.

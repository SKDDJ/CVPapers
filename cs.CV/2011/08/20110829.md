- **Summary**: We present alpha-expansion beta-shrink moves, a simple generalization of the widely-used alpha-beta swap and alpha-expansion algorithms for approximate energy minimization. We show that in a certain sense, these moves dominate both alpha-beta-swap and alpha-expansion moves, but unlike previous generalizations the new moves require no additional assumptions and are still solvable in polynomial-time. We show promising experimental results with the new moves, which we believe could be used in any context where alpha-expansions are currently employed.

- **Summary**: In this paper we develop a new technique to model joint distributions of signals. Our technique is based on quantum mechanical conjugate variables. We show that the transition probability of quantum states leads to a distance function on the signals. This distance function obeys the triangle inequality on all quantum states and becomes a metric on pure quantum states. Treating signals as conjugate variables allows us to create a new approach to segment them.   Keywords: Quantum information, transition probability, Euclidean distance, Fubini-study metric, Bhattacharyya coefficients, conjugate variable, signal/sensor fusion, signal and image segmentation.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel algorithm for compressive imaging that exploits both the sparsity and persistence across scales found in the 2D wavelet transform coefficients of natural images. Like other recent works, we model wavelet structure using a hidden Markov tree (HMT) but, unlike other works, ours is based on loopy belief propagation (LBP). For LBP, we adopt a recently proposed "turbo" message passing schedule that alternates between exploitation of HMT structure and exploitation of compressive-measurement structure. For the latter, we leverage Donoho, Maleki, and Montanari's recently proposed approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. Experiments with a large image database suggest that, relative to existing schemes, our turbo LBP approach yields state-of-the-art reconstruction performance with substantial reduction in complexity.

- **Summary**: There are many image fusion methods that can be used to produce high-resolution mutlispectral images from a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image and low-resolution multispectral (MS) of remote sensed images. This paper attempts to undertake the study of image fusion techniques with different Statistical techniques for image fusion as Local Mean Matching (LMM), Local Mean and Variance Matching (LMVM), Regression variable substitution (RVS), Local Correlation Modeling (LCM) and they are compared with one another so as to choose the best technique, that can be applied on multi-resolution satellite images. This paper also devotes to concentrate on the analytical techniques for evaluating the quality of image fusion (F) by using various methods including Standard Deviation (SD), Entropy(En), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Signal-to Noise Ratio (SNR), Normalization Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Deviation Index (DI) to estimate the quality and degree of information improvement of a fused image quantitatively.

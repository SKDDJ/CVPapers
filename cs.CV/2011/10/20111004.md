- **Summary**: In machine learning and computer vision, input images are often filtered to increase data discriminability. In some situations, however, one may wish to purposely decrease discriminability of one classification task (a "distractor" task), while simultaneously preserving information relevant to another (the task-of-interest): For example, it may be important to mask the identity of persons contained in face images before submitting them to a crowdsourcing site (e.g., Mechanical Turk) when labeling them for certain facial attributes. Another example is inter-dataset generalization: when training on a dataset with a particular covariance structure among multiple attributes, it may be useful to suppress one attribute while preserving another so that a trained classifier does not learn spurious correlations between attributes. In this paper we present an algorithm that finds optimal filters to give high discriminability to one task while simultaneously giving low discriminability to a distractor task. We present results showing the effectiveness of the proposed technique on both simulated data and natural face images.

- **Summary**: There is a growing interest in using a longitudinal observational databases to detect drug safety signal. In this paper we present a novel method, which we used online during the OMOP Cup. We consider homogeneous ensembling, which is based on random re-sampling (known, also, as bagging) as a main innovation compared to the previous publications in the related field. This study is based on a very large simulated database of the 10 million patients records, which was created by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). Compared to the traditional classification problem, the given data are unlabelled. The objective of this study is to discover hidden associations between drugs and conditions. The main idea of the approach, which we used during the OMOP Cup is to compare the numbers of observed and expected patterns. This comparison may be organised in several different ways, and the outcomes (base learners) may be quite different as well. It is proposed to construct the final decision function as an ensemble of the base learners. Our method was recognised formally by the Organisers of the OMOP Cup as a top performing method for the Challenge N2.

- **Summary**: Construction of a scale space with a convolution filter has been studied extensively in the past. It has been proven that the only convolution kernel that satisfies the scale space requirements is a Gaussian type. In this paper, we consider a matrix of convolution filters introduced in [1] as a building kernel for a scale space, and shows that we can construct a non-Gaussian scale space with a $2\times 2$ matrix of filters. The paper derives sufficient conditions for the matrix of filters for being a scale space kernel, and present some numerical demonstrations.

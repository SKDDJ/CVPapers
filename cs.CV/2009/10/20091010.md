- **Summary**: A multi-scale approach to the inverse reconstruction of a pattern's microstructure is reported. Instead of a correlation function, a pair of entropic descriptors (EDs) is proposed for stochastic optimization method. The first of them measures a spatial inhomogeneity, for a binary pattern, or compositional one, for a greyscale image. The second one quantifies a spatial or compositional statistical complexity. The EDs reveal structural information that is dissimilar, at least in part, to that given by correlation functions at almost all of discrete length scales. The method is tested on a few digitized binary and greyscale images. In each of the cases, the persuasive reconstruction of the microstructure is found.

- **Summary**: We present promising results for real-time vehicle visual detection, obtained with adaBoost using new original ?keypoints presence features?. These weak-classifiers produce a boolean response based on presence or absence in the tested image of a ?keypoint? (~ a SURF interest point) with a descriptor sufficiently similar (i.e. within a given distance) to a reference descriptor characterizing the feature. A first experiment was conducted on a public image dataset containing lateral-viewed cars, yielding 95% recall with 95% precision on test set. Moreover, analysis of the positions of adaBoost-selected keypoints show that they correspond to a specific part of the object category (such as ?wheel? or ?side skirt?) and thus have a ?semantic? meaning.

- **Summary**: This paper shows how to improve the real-time object detection in complex robotics applications, by exploring new visual features as AdaBoost weak classifiers. These new features are symmetric Haar filters (enforcing global horizontal and vertical symmetry) and N-connexity control points. Experimental evaluation on a car database show that the latter appear to provide the best results for the vehicle-detection problem.

- **Summary**: We present promising results for visual object categorization, obtained with adaBoost using new original ?keypoints-based features?. These weak-classifiers produce a boolean response based on presence or absence in the tested image of a ?keypoint? (a kind of SURF interest point) with a descriptor sufficiently similar (i.e. within a given distance) to a reference descriptor characterizing the feature. A first experiment was conducted on a public image dataset containing lateral-viewed cars, yielding 95% recall with 95% precision on test set. Preliminary tests on a small subset of a pedestrians database also gives promising 97% recall with 92 % precision, which shows the generality of our new family of features. Moreover, analysis of the positions of adaBoost-selected keypoints show that they correspond to a specific part of the object category (such as ?wheel? or ?side skirt? in the case of lateral-cars) and thus have a ?semantic? meaning. We also made a first test on video for detecting vehicles from adaBoostselected keypoints filtered in real-time from all detected keypoints.

- **Summary**: We present a new modular traffic signs recognition system, successfully applied to both American and European speed limit signs. Our sign detection step is based only on shape-detection (rectangles or circles). This enables it to work on grayscale images, contrary to most European competitors, which eases robustness to illumination conditions (notably night operation). Speed sign candidates are classified (or rejected) by segmenting potential digits inside them (which is rather original and has several advantages), and then applying a neural digit recognition. The global detection rate is ~90% for both (standard) U.S. and E.U. speed signs, with a misclassification rate <1%, and no validated false alarm in >150 minutes of video. The system processes in real-time ~20 frames/s on a standard high-end laptop.

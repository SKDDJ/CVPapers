- **Summary**: In this paper, the performance of the emerging MPEG-4 SVC CODEC is evaluated. In the first part, a brief introduction on the subject of quality assessment and the development of the MPEG-4 SVC CODEC is given. After that, the used test methodologies are described in detail, followed by an explanation of the actual test scenarios. The main part of this work concentrates on the performance analysis of the MPEG-4 SVC CODEC - both objective and subjective.

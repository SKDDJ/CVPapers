- **Summary**: We present a parametric deformable model which recovers image components with a complexity independent from the resolution of input images. The proposed model also automatically changes its topology and remains fully compatible with the general framework of deformable models. More precisely, the image space is equipped with a metric that expands salient image details according to their strength and their curvature. During the whole evolution of the model, the sampling of the contour is kept regular with respect to this metric. By this way, the vertex density is reduced along most parts of the curve while a high quality of shape representation is preserved. The complexity of the deformable model is thus improved and is no longer influenced by feature-preserving changes in the resolution of input images. Building the metric requires a prior estimation of contour curvature. It is obtained using a robust estimator which investigates the local variations in the orientation of image gradient. Experimental results on both computer generated and biomedical images are presented to illustrate the advantages of our approach.

- **Summary**: We introduce an adaptive regularization approach. In contrast to conventional Tikhonov regularization, which specifies a fixed regularization operator, we estimate it simultaneously with parameters. From a Bayesian perspective we estimate the prior distribution on parameters assuming that it is close to some given model distribution. We constrain the prior distribution to be a Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF), which allows us to solve for the prior distribution analytically and provides a fast optimization algorithm. We apply our approach to non-rigid image registration to estimate the spatial transformation between two images. Our evaluation shows that the adaptive regularization approach significantly outperforms standard variational methods.

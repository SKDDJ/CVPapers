- **Summary**: The scope of this project's work focuses on the research and prototyping of the extension of the Distributed MARF such that its services can be managed through the most popular management protocol familiarly, SNMP. The rationale behind SNMP vs. MARF's proprietary management protocols, is that can be integrated with the use of common network service and device management, so the administrators can manage MARF nodes via a already familiar protocol, as well as monitor their performance, gather statistics, set desired configuration, etc. perhaps using the same management tools they've been using for other network devices and application servers.

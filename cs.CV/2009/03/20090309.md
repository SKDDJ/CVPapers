- **Summary**: A sketch, found in one of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks and covered by the written notes of this genius, has been recently restored. The restoration reveals a possible self-portrait of the artist, drawn when he was young. Here, we discuss the discovery of this self-portrait and the procedure used for restoration. Actually, this is a restoration performed on the digital image of the sketch, a procedure that can easily extended and applied to ancient documents for studies of art and palaeography.

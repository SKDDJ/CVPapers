- **Summary**: This paper proposes an algorithm for image processing, obtained by adapting to image maps the definitions of two well-known physical quantities. These quantities are the dipole and quadrupole moments of a charge distribution. We will see how it is possible to define dipole and quadrupole moments for the gray-tone maps and apply them in the development of algorithms for edge detection.

- **Summary**: A well-known issue of local (adaptive) histogram equalization (LHE) is over-enhancement (i.e., generation of spurious details) in homogenous areas of the image. In this paper, we show that the LHE problem has many solutions due to the ambiguity in ranking pixels with the same intensity. The LHE solution space can be searched for the images having the maximum PSNR or structural similarity (SSIM) with the input image. As compared to the results of the prior art, these solutions are more similar to the input image while offering the same local contrast.   Index Terms: histogram modification or specification, contrast enhancement

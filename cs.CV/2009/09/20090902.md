- **Summary**: By a "covering" we mean a Gaussian mixture model fit to observed data. Approximations of the Bayes factor can be availed of to judge model fit to the data within a given Gaussian mixture model. Between families of Gaussian mixture models, we propose the R\'enyi quadratic entropy as an excellent and tractable model comparison framework. We exemplify this using the segmentation of an MRI image volume, based (1) on a direct Gaussian mixture model applied to the marginal distribution function, and (2) Gaussian model fit through k-means applied to the 4D multivalued image volume furnished by the wavelet transform. Visual preference for one model over another is not immediate. The R\'enyi quadratic entropy allows us to show clearly that one of these modelings is superior to the other.

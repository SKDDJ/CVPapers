- **Summary**: This paper deals with computing topological invariants such as connected components, boundary surface genus, and homology groups. For each input data set, we have designed or implemented algorithms to calculate connected components, boundary surfaces and their genus, and homology groups. Due to the fact that genus calculation dominates the entire task for 3D object in 3D space, in this paper, we mainly discuss the calculation of the genus. The new algorithms designed in this paper will perform:   (1) pathological cases detection and deletion, (2) raster space to point space (dual space) transformation, (3) the linear time algorithm for boundary point classification, and (4) genus calculation.

- **Summary**: Understanding predator-prey relationships among insects is a challenging task in the domain of insect-colony research. This is due to several factors involved, such as determining whether a particular behavior is the result of a predator-prey interaction, a friend-foe interaction or another kind of interaction. In this paper, we analyze a series of predator-prey and friend-foe interactions in two colonies of carpenter ants to better understand and predict such behavior. Using the data gathered, we have also come up with a preliminary model for predicting such behavior under the specific conditions the experiment was conducted in. In this paper, we present the results of our data analysis as well as an overview of the processes involved.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a method of gesture recognition with a focus on important actions for distinguishing similar gestures. The method generates a partial action sequence by using optical flow images, expresses the sequence in the eigenspace, and checks the feature vector sequence by applying an optimum path-searching method of weighted graph to focus the important actions. Also presented are the results of an experiment on the recognition of similar sign language words.

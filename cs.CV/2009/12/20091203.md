- **Summary**: Isometric feature mapping (Isomap) is a promising manifold learning method. However, Isomap fails to work on data which distribute on clusters in a single manifold or manifolds. Many works have been done on extending Isomap to multi-manifolds learning. In this paper, we first proposed a new multi-manifolds learning algorithm (M-Isomap) with help of a general procedure. The new algorithm preserves intra-manifold geodesics and multiple inter-manifolds edges precisely. Compared with previous methods, this algorithm can isometrically learn data distributed on several manifolds. Secondly, the original multi-cluster manifold learning algorithm first proposed in \cite{DCIsomap} and called D-C Isomap has been revised so that the revised D-C Isomap can learn multi-manifolds data. Finally, the features and effectiveness of the proposed multi-manifolds learning algorithms are demonstrated and compared through experiments.

- **Summary**: Multiview 3D face modeling has attracted increasing attention recently and has become one of the potential avenues in future video systems. We aim to make more reliable and robust automatic feature extraction and natural 3D feature construction from 2D features detected on a pair of frontal and profile view face images. We propose several heuristic algorithms to minimize possible errors introduced by prevalent nonperfect orthogonal condition and noncoherent luminance. In our approach, we first extract the 2D features that are visible to both cameras in both views. Then, we estimate the coordinates of the features in the hidden profile view based on the visible features extracted in the two orthogonal views. Finally, based on the coordinates of the extracted features, we deform a 3D generic model to perform the desired 3D clone modeling. Present study proves the scope of resulted facial models for practical applications like face recognition and facial animation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a new reversible image authentication technique with tamper localization based on watermarking in integer wavelet transform is proposed. If the image authenticity is verified, then the distortion due to embedding the watermark can be completely removed from the watermarked image. If the image is tampered, then the tampering positions can also be localized. Two layers of watermarking are used. The first layer embedded in spatial domain verifies authenticity and the second layer embedded in transform domain provides reversibility. This technique utilizes selective LSB embedding and histogram characteristics of the difference images of the wavelet coefficients and modifies pixel values slightly to embed the watermark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can detect any modifications of the watermarked image.

- **Summary**: We apply deep belief networks of restricted Boltzmann machines to bags of words of sift features obtained from databases of 13 Scenes, 15 Scenes and Caltech 256 and study experimentally their behavior and performance. We find that the final performance in the supervised phase is reached much faster if the system is pre-trained. Pre-training the system on a larger dataset keeping the supervised dataset fixed improves the performance (for the 13 Scenes case). After the unsupervised pre-training, neurons arise that form approximate explicit representations for several categories (meaning they are mostly active for this category). The last three facts suggest that unsupervised training really discovers structure in these data. Pre-training can be done on a completely different dataset (we use Corel dataset) and we find that the supervised phase performs just as good (on the 15 Scenes dataset). This leads us to conjecture that one can pre-train the system once (e.g. in a factory) and subsequently apply it to many supervised problems which then learn much faster. The best performance is obtained with single hidden layer system suggesting that the histogram of sift features doesn't have much high level structure. The overall performance is almost equal, but slightly worse then that of the support vector machine and the spatial pyramidal matching.

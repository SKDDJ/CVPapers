- **Summary**: We presents in this paper a novel fish classification methodology based on a combination between robust feature selection, image segmentation and geometrical parameter techniques using Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree. Unlike existing works for fish classification, which propose descriptors and do not analyze their individual impacts in the whole classification task and do not make the combination between the feature selection, image segmentation and geometrical parameter, we propose a general set of features extraction using robust feature selection, image segmentation and geometrical parameter and their correspondent weights that should be used as a priori information by the classifier. In this sense, instead of studying techniques for improving the classifiers structure itself, we consider it as a black box and focus our research in the determination of which input information must bring a robust fish discrimination.The main contribution of this paper is enhancement recognize and classify fishes based on digital image and To develop and implement a novel fish recognition prototype using global feature extraction, image segmentation and geometrical parameters, it have the ability to Categorize the given fish into its cluster and Categorize the clustered fish into poison or non-poison fish, and categorizes the non-poison fish into its family .

- **Summary**: Image filtering algorithms are applied on images to remove the different types of noise that are either present in the image during capturing or injected in to the image during transmission. Underwater images when captured usually have Gaussian noise, speckle noise and salt and pepper noise. In this work, five different image filtering algorithms are compared for the three different noise types. The performances of the filters are compared using the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The modified spatial median filter gives desirable results in terms of the above two parameters for the three different noise. Forty underwater images are taken for study.

- **Summary**: Biogeography is the study of the geographical distribution of biological organisms. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature. Biogeography Based Optimization is a burgeoning nature inspired technique to find the optimal solution of the problem. Satellite image classification is an important task because it is the only way we can know about the land cover map of inaccessible areas. Though satellite images have been classified in past by using various techniques, the researchers are always finding alternative strategies for satellite image classification so that they may be prepared to select the most appropriate technique for the feature extraction task in hand. This paper is focused on classification of the satellite image of a particular land cover using the theory of Biogeography based Optimization. The original BBO algorithm does not have the inbuilt property of clustering which is required during image classification. Hence modifications have been proposed to the original algorithm and the modified algorithm is used to classify the satellite image of a given region. The results indicate that highly accurate land cover features can be extracted effectively when the proposed algorithm is used.

- **Summary**: A fingerprint matching is a very difficult problem. Minutiae based matching is the most popular and widely used technique for fingerprint matching. The minutiae points considered in automatic identification systems are based normally on termination and bifurcation points. In this paper we propose a new technique for fingerprint matching using minutiae points and genetic programming. The goal of this paper is extracting the mathematical formula that defines the minutiae points.

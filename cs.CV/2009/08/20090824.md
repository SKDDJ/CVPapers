- **Summary**: A binocular system developed by the author in terms of projective Fourier transform (PFT) of the conformal camera, which numerically integrates the head, eyes, and visual cortex, is used to process visual information during saccadic eye movements. Although we make three saccades per second at the eyeball's maximum speed of 700 deg/sec, our visual system accounts for these incisive eye movements to produce a stable percept of the world. This visual constancy is maintained by neuronal receptive field shifts in various retinotopically organized cortical areas prior to saccade onset, giving the brain access to visual information from the saccade's target before the eyes' arrival. It integrates visual information acquisition across saccades. Our modeling utilizes basic properties of PFT. First, PFT is computable by FFT in complex logarithmic coordinates that approximate the retinotopy. Second, a translation in retinotopic (logarithmic) coordinates, modeled by the shift property of the Fourier transform, remaps the presaccadic scene into a postsaccadic reference frame. It also accounts for the perisaccadic mislocalization observed by human subjects in laboratory experiments. Because our modeling involves cross-disciplinary areas of conformal geometry, abstract and computational harmonic analysis, computational vision, and visual neuroscience, we include the corresponding background material and elucidate how these different areas interwove in our modeling of primate perception. In particular, we present the physiological and behavioral facts underlying the neural processes related to our modeling. We also emphasize the conformal camera's geometry and discuss how it is uniquely useful in the intermediate-level vision computational aspects of natural scene understanding.

- **Summary**: The dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) is known to exhibit better shift-invariance than the conventional discrete wavelet transform. We propose an amplitude-phase representation of the DT-CWT which, among other things, offers a direct explanation for the improvement in the shift-invariance. The representation is based on the shifting action of the group of fractional Hilbert transform (fHT) operators, which extends the notion of arbitrary phase-shifts from sinusoids to finite-energy signals (wavelets in particular). In particular, we characterize the shiftability of the DT-CWT in terms of the shifting property of the fHTs. At the heart of the representation are certain fundamental invariances of the fHT group, namely that of translation, dilation, and norm, which play a decisive role in establishing the key properties of the transform. It turns out that these fundamental invariances are exclusive to this group.   Next, by introducing a generalization of the Bedrosian theorem for the fHT operator, we derive an explicitly understanding of the shifting action of the fHT for the particular family of wavelets obtained through the modulation of lowpass functions (e.g., the Shannon and Gabor wavelet). This, in effect, links the corresponding dual-tree transform with the framework of windowed-Fourier analysis. Finally, we extend these ideas to the multi-dimensional setting by introducing a directional extension of the fHT, the fractional directional Hilbert transform. In particular, we derive a signal representation involving the superposition of direction-selective wavelets with appropriate phase-shifts, which helps explain the improved shift-invariance of the transform along certain preferential directions.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method for constructing Hilbert transform (HT) pairs of wavelet bases based on a fundamental approximation-theoretic characterization of scaling functions--the B-spline factorization theorem. In particular, starting from well-localized scaling functions, we construct HT pairs of biorthogonal wavelet bases of L^2(R) by relating the corresponding wavelet filters via a discrete form of the continuous HT filter. As a concrete application of this methodology, we identify HT pairs of spline wavelets of a specific flavor, which are then combined to realize a family of complex wavelets that resemble the optimally-localized Gabor function for sufficiently large orders.   Analytic wavelets, derived from the complexification of HT wavelet pairs, exhibit a one-sided spectrum. Based on the tensor-product of such analytic wavelets, and, in effect, by appropriately combining four separable biorthogonal wavelet bases of L^2(R^2), we then discuss a methodology for constructing 2D directional-selective complex wavelets. In particular, analogous to the HT correspondence between the components of the 1D counterpart, we relate the real and imaginary components of these complex wavelets using a multi-dimensional extension of the HT--the directional HT. Next, we construct a family of complex spline wavelets that resemble the directional Gabor functions proposed by Daugman. Finally, we present an efficient FFT-based filterbank algorithm for implementing the associated complex wavelet transform.

- **Summary**: A hierarchical interval subdivision is shown to lead to a $p$-adic encoding of image data. This allows in the case of the relative pose problem in computer vision and photogrammetry to derive equations having 2-adic numbers as coefficients, and to use Hensel's lifting method to their solution. This method is applied to the linear and non-linear equations coming from eight, seven or five point correspondences. An inherent property of the method is its robustness.

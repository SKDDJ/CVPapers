- **Summary**: Bottom-up saliency, an early human visual processing, behaves like binary classification of interest and null hypothesis. Its discriminant power, mutual information of image features and class distribution, is closely related to saliency value by the well-known centre-surround theory. As classification accuracy very much depends on window sizes, the discriminant saliency (power) varies according to sampling scales. Discriminating power estimation in multi-scales framework needs integrating with wavelet transformation and then estimating statistical discrepancy of two consecutive scales (centre-surround windows) by Hidden Markov Tree (HMT) model. Finally, multi-scale discriminant saliency (MDIS) maps are combined by the maximum information rule to synthesize a final saliency map. All MDIS maps are evaluated with standard quantitative tools (NSS,LCC,AUC) on N.Bruce's database with ground truth data as eye-tracking locations ; as well assessed qualitatively by visual examination of individual cases. For evaluating MDIS against well-known AIM saliency method, simulations are needed and described in details with several interesting conclusions, drawn for further research directions.

- **Summary**: Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates a graph embedding approach with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm converges, and can be used to efficiently embed large graphs on the order of thousands of nodes.

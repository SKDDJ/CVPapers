- **Summary**: We propose a new Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) to qualify edge maps without Ground Truth (GT) knowledge. The measure is the product of two indices, an \emph{Equilibrium} index $\mathcal{E}$ obtained by projecting the edge map into a family of edge patterns, and an \emph{Entropy} index $\mathcal{H}$, defined as a function of the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) statistic.   This new measure can be used for performance characterization which includes: (i)~the specific evaluation of an algorithm (intra-technique process) in order to identify its best parameters, and (ii)~the comparison of different algorithms (inter-technique process) in order to classify them according to their quality.   Results made over images of the South Florida and Berkeley databases show that our approach significantly improves over Pratt's Figure of Merit (PFoM) which is the objective reference-based edge map evaluation standard, as it takes into account more features in its evaluation.

- **Summary**: Object detection and recognition are important problems in computer vision. Since these problems are meta-heuristic, despite a lot of research, practically usable, intelligent, real-time, and dynamic object detection/recognition methods are still unavailable. We propose a new object detection/recognition method, which improves over the existing methods in every stage of the object detection/recognition process. In addition to the usual features, we propose to use geometric shapes, like linear cues, ellipses and quadrangles, as additional features. The full potential of geometric cues is exploited by using them to extract other features in a robust, computationally efficient, and less meta-heuristic manner. We also propose a new hierarchical codebook, which provides good generalization and discriminative properties. The codebook enables fast multi-path inference mechanisms based on propagation of conditional likelihoods, that make it robust to occlusion and noise. It has the capability of dynamic learning. We also propose a new learning method that has generative and discriminative learning capabilities, does not need large and fully supervised training dataset, and is capable of online learning. The preliminary work of detecting geometric shapes in real images has been completed. This preliminary work is the focus of this report. Future path for realizing the proposed object detection/recognition method is also discussed in brief.

- **Summary**: Signal processing tasks as fundamental as sampling, reconstruction, minimum mean-square error interpolation and prediction can be viewed under the prism of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Endowing this vantage point with contemporary advances in sparsity-aware modeling and processing, promotes the nonparametric basis pursuit advocated in this paper as the overarching framework for the confluence of kernel-based learning (KBL) approaches leveraging sparse linear regression, nuclear-norm regularization, and dictionary learning. The novel sparse KBL toolbox goes beyond translating sparse parametric approaches to their nonparametric counterparts, to incorporate new possibilities such as multi-kernel selection and matrix smoothing. The impact of sparse KBL to signal processing applications is illustrated through test cases from cognitive radio sensing, microarray data imputation, and network traffic prediction.

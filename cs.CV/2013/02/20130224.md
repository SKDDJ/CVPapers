- **Summary**: Shape is one of the main features in content based image retrieval (CBIR). This paper proposes a new shape signature. In this technique, features of each shape are extracted based on four sides of the rectangle that covers the shape. The proposed technique is Fourier based and it is invariant to translation, scaling and rotation. The retrieval performance between some commonly used Fourier based signatures and the proposed four sides distance (FSD) signature has been tested using MPEG-7 database. Experimental results are shown that the FSD signature has better performance compared with those signatures.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we derive new shape descriptors based on a directional characterization. The main idea is to study the behavior of the shape neighborhood under family of transformations. We obtain a description invariant with respect to rotation, reflection, translation and scaling. A well-defined metric is then proposed on the associated feature space. We show the continuity of this metric. Some results on shape retrieval are provided on two databases to show the accuracy of the proposed shape metric.

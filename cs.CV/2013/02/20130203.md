- **Summary**: The problem of deblurring an image when the blur kernel is unknown remains challenging after decades of work. Recently there has been rapid progress on correcting irregular blur patterns caused by camera shake, but there is still much room for improvement. We propose a new blind deconvolution method using incremental sparse edge approximation to recover images blurred by camera shake. We estimate the blur kernel first from only the strongest edges in the image, then gradually refine this estimate by allowing for weaker and weaker edges. Our method competes with the benchmark deblurring performance of the state-of-the-art while being significantly faster and easier to generalize.

- **Summary**: Technological advances in sensor manufacture, communication, and computing are stimulating the development of new applications that are transforming traditional vision systems into pervasive intelligent camera networks. The analysis of visual cues in multi-camera networks enables a wide range of applications, from smart home and office automation to large area surveillance and traffic surveillance. While dense camera networks - in which most cameras have large overlapping fields of view - are well studied, we are mainly concerned with sparse camera networks. A sparse camera network undertakes large area surveillance using as few cameras as possible, and most cameras have non-overlapping fields of view with one another. The task is challenging due to the lack of knowledge about the topological structure of the network, variations in the appearance and motion of specific tracking targets in different views, and the difficulties of understanding composite events in the network. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent research results to address the problems of intra-camera tracking, topological structure learning, target appearance modeling, and global activity understanding in sparse camera networks. A number of current open research issues are discussed.

- **Summary**: For nonrigid image registration, matching the particular structures (or the outliers) that have missing correspondence and/or local large deformations, can be more difficult than matching the common structures with small deformations in the two images. Most existing works depend heavily on the outlier segmentation to remove the outlier effect in the registration. Moreover, these works do not handle simultaneously the missing correspondences and local large deformations. In this paper, we defined the nonrigid image registration as a local adaptive kernel regression which locally reconstruct the moving image's dense deformation vectors from the sparse deformation vectors in the multi-resolution block matching. The kernel function of the kernel regression adapts its shape and orientation to the reference image's structure to gather more deformation vector samples of the same structure for the iterative regression computation, whereby the moving image's local deformations could be compliant with the reference image's local structures. To estimate the local deformations around the outliers, we use joint saliency map that highlights the corresponding saliency structures (called Joint Saliency Structures, JSSs) in the two images to guide the dense deformation reconstruction by emphasizing those JSSs' sparse deformation vectors in the kernel regression. The experimental results demonstrate that by using local JSS adaptive kernel regression, the proposed method achieves almost the best performance in alignment of all challenging image pairs with outlier structures compared with other five state-of-the-art nonrigid registration algorithms.

- **Summary**: The discrete distribution clustering algorithm, namely D2-clustering, has demonstrated its usefulness in image classification and annotation where each object is represented by a bag of weighed vectors. The high computational complexity of the algorithm, however, limits its applications to large-scale problems. We present a parallel D2-clustering algorithm with substantially improved scalability. A hierarchical structure for parallel computing is devised to achieve a balance between the individual-node computation and the integration process of the algorithm. Additionally, it is shown that even with a single CPU, the hierarchical structure results in significant speed-up. Experiments on real-world large-scale image data, Youtube video data, and protein sequence data demonstrate the efficiency and wide applicability of the parallel D2-clustering algorithm. The loss in clustering accuracy is minor in comparison with the original sequential algorithm.

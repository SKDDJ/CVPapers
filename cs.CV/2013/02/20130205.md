- **Summary**: Image denoising is one of the fundamental problems in image processing. In this paper, a novel approach to suppress noise from the image is conducted by applying the interquartile range (IQR) which is one of the statistical methods used to detect outlier effect from a dataset. A window of size kXk was implemented to support IQR filter. Each pixel outside the IQR range of the kXk window is treated as noisy pixel. The estimation of the noisy pixels was obtained by local averaging. The essential advantage of applying IQR filter is to preserve edge sharpness better of the original image. A variety of test images have been used to support the proposed filter and PSNR was calculated and compared with median filter. The experimental results on standard test images demonstrate this filter is simpler and better performing than median filter.

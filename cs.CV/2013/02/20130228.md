- **Summary**: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been one of the most important research areas in computer vision. It is a widely used method for searching images in huge databases. In this paper we present a CBIR system called NOHIS-Search. The system is based on the indexing technique NOHIS-tree. The two phases of the system are described and the performance of the system is illustrated with the image database ImagEval. NOHIS-Search system was compared to other two CBIR systems; the first that using PDDP indexing algorithm and the second system is that using the sequential search. Results show that NOHIS-Search system outperforms the two other systems.

- **Summary**: The Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan image requires expertise in the segmentation where clustering algorithm plays an important role in the automation process. The algorithm optimization is concluded based on the performance, quality and number of clusters extracted. This paper is proposed to study the commonly used K Means clustering algorithm and to discuss a brief list of toolboxes for reproducing and extending works presented in medical image analysis. This work is compiled using AForge .NET framework in windows environment and MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB 7.0.1)

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method to apply the popular cascade classifier into face recognition to improve the computational efficiency while keeping high recognition rate. In large scale face recognition systems, because the probability of feature templates coming from different subjects is very high, most of the matching pairs will be rejected by the early stages of the cascade. Therefore, the cascade can improve the matching speed significantly. On the other hand, using the nested structure of the cascade, we could drop some stages at the end of feature to reduce the memory and bandwidth usage in some resources intensive system while not sacrificing the performance too much. The cascade is learned by two steps. Firstly, some kind of prepared features are grouped into several nested stages. And then, the threshold of each stage is learned to achieve user defined verification rate (VR). In the paper, we take a landmark based Gabor+LDA face recognition system as baseline to illustrate the process and advantages of the proposed method. However, the use of this method is very generic and not limited in face recognition, which can be easily generalized to other biometrics as a post-processing module. Experiments on the FERET database show the good performance of our baseline and an experiment on a self-collected large scale database illustrates that the cascade can improve the matching speed significantly.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a new shape-based image reconstruction technique applicable to a large class of imaging problems formulated in a variational sense. Given a collection of shape priors (a shape dictionary), we define our problem as choosing the right elements and geometrically composing them through basic set operations to characterize desired regions in the image. This combinatorial problem can be relaxed and then solved using classical descent methods. The main component of this relaxation is forming certain compactly supported functions which we call "knolls", and reformulating the shape representation as a basis expansion in terms of such functions. To select suitable elements of the dictionary, our problem ultimately reduces to solving a nonlinear program with sparsity constraints. We provide a new sparse nonlinear reconstruction technique to approach this problem. The performance of proposed technique is demonstrated with some standard imaging problems including image segmentation, X-ray tomography and diffusive tomography.

- **Summary**: This work proposes an agnostic inference strategy for material diagnostics, conceived within the context of laser-based non-destructive evaluation methods, which extract information about structural anomalies from the analysis of acoustic wavefields measured on the structure's surface by means of a scanning laser interferometer. The proposed approach couples spatiotemporal windowing with low rank plus outlier modeling, to identify a priori unknown deviations in the propagating wavefields caused by material inhomogeneities or defects, using virtually no knowledge of the structural and material properties of the medium. This characteristic makes the approach particularly suitable for diagnostics scenarios where the mechanical and material models are complex, unknown, or unreliable. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated environment using benchmark point and line defect localization problems based on propagating flexural waves in a thin plate.

- **Summary**: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful learners that have led to state-of-the-art results in various computer vision problems. SVMs suffer from various drawbacks in terms of selecting the right kernel, which depends on the image descriptors, as well as computational and memory efficiency. This paper introduces a novel kernel, which serves such issues well. The kernel is learned by exploiting a large amount of low-complex, randomized binary mappings of the input feature. This leads to an efficient SVM, while also alleviating the task of kernel selection. We demonstrate the capabilities of our kernel on 6 standard vision benchmarks, in which we combine several common image descriptors, namely histograms (Flowers17 and Daimler), attribute-like descriptors (UCI, OSR, and a-VOC08), and Sparse Quantization (ImageNet). Results show that our kernel learning adapts well to the different descriptors types, achieving the performance of the kernels specifically tuned for each image descriptor, and with similar evaluation cost as efficient SVM methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we construct multimodal spectral geometry by finding a pair of closest commuting operators (CCO) to a given pair of Laplacians. The CCOs are jointly diagonalizable and hence have the same eigenbasis. Our construction naturally extends classical data analysis tools based on spectral geometry, such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering. We provide several synthetic and real examples of applications in dimensionality reduction, shape analysis, and clustering, demonstrating that our method better captures the inherent structure of multi-modal data.

- **Summary**: The development of energy selective, photon counting X-ray detectors allows for a wide range of new possibilities in the area of computed tomographic image formation. Under the assumption of perfect energy resolution, here we propose a tensor-based iterative algorithm that simultaneously reconstructs the X-ray attenuation distribution for each energy. We use a multi-linear image model rather than a more standard "stacked vector" representation in order to develop novel tensor-based regularizers. Specifically, we model the multi-spectral unknown as a 3-way tensor where the first two dimensions are space and the third dimension is energy. This approach allows for the design of tensor nuclear norm regularizers, which like its two dimensional counterpart, is a convex function of the multi-spectral unknown. The solution to the resulting convex optimization problem is obtained using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Simulation results shows that the generalized tensor nuclear norm can be used as a stand alone regularization technique for the energy selective (spectral) computed tomography (CT) problem and when combined with total variation regularization it enhances the regularization capabilities especially at low energy images where the effects of noise are most prominent.

- **Summary**: Artificial visual attention systems aim to support technical systems in visual tasks by applying the concepts of selective attention observed in humans and other animals. Such systems are typically evaluated against ground truth obtained from human gaze-data or manually annotated test images. When applied to robotics, the systems are required to be adaptable to the target system. Here, we describe a flexible environment based on a robotic middleware layer allowing the development and testing of attention-guided vision systems. In such a framework, the systems can be tested with input from various sources, different attention algorithms at the core, and diverse subsequent tasks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider the clustering problem on images where each image contains patches in people and location domains. We exploit the correlation between people and location domains, and proposed a semi-supervised co-clustering algorithm to cluster images. Our algorithm updates the correlation links at the runtime, and produces clustering in both domains simultaneously. We conduct experiments in a manually collected dataset and a Flickr dataset. The result shows that the such correlation improves the clustering performance.

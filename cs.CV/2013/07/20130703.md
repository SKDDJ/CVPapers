- **Summary**: Imaging has occupied a huge role in the management of patients, whether hospitalized or not. Depending on the patients clinical problem, a variety of imaging modalities were available for use. This gave birth of the annotation of medical image process. The annotation is intended to image analysis and solve the problem of semantic gap. The reason for image annotation is due to increase in acquisition of images. Physicians and radiologists feel better while using annotation techniques for faster remedy in surgery and medicine due to the following reasons: giving details to the patients, searching the present and past records from the larger databases, and giving solutions to them in a faster and more accurate way. However, classical conceptual modeling does not incorporate the specificity of medical domain specially the annotation of medical image. The design phase is the most important activity in the successful building of annotation process. For this reason, we focus in this paper on presenting the conceptual modeling of the annotation of medical image by defining a new profile using the StarUML extensibility mechanism.

- **Summary**: As an extension of projective homology, stereohomology is proposed via an extension of Desargues theorem and the extended Desargues configuration. Geometric transformations such as reflection, translation, central symmetry, central projection, parallel projection, shearing, central dilation, scaling, and so on are all included in stereohomology and represented as Householder-Chen elementary matrices. Hence all these geometric transformations are called elementary. This makes it possible to represent these elementary geometric transformations in homogeneous square matrices independent of a particular choice of coordinate system.

- **Summary**: Digital water marking is one of the essential fields in image security and copyright protection. The proposed technique in this paper was based on the principle of protecting images by hide an invisible watermark in the image. The technique starts with merging the cover image and the watermark image with suitable ratios, i.e., 99% from the cover image will be merged with 1% from the watermark image. Technically, the fading process is irreversible but with the proposed technique, the probability to reconstruct the original watermark image is great. There is no perceptible difference between the original and watermarked image by human eye. The experimental results show that the proposed technique proven its ability to hide images that have the same size of the cover image. Three performance measures were implemented to support the proposed techniques which are MSE, PSNR, and SSIM. Fortunately, all the three measures have excellent values.

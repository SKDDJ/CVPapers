- **Summary**: Automatic analysis of the enormous sets of images is a critical task in life sciences. This faces many challenges such as: algorithms are highly parameterized, significant human input is intertwined, and lacking a standard meta-visualization approach. This paper proposes an alternative iterative approach for optimizing input parameters, saving time by minimizing the user involvement, and allowing for understanding the workflow of algorithms and discovering new ones. The main focus is on developing an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. This technique is implemented as a prototype called Veni Vidi Vici, or "I came, I saw, I conquered." This strategy is inspired by the mathematical formulas of numbering computable functions and is developed atop ImageJ, a scientific image processing program. A case study is presented to investigate the proposed framework. Finally, the paper explores some potential future issues in the application of the proposed approach in parameter space analysis in visualization.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is a crucial step in a wide range of method image processing systems. It is useful in visualization of the different objects present in the image. In spite of the several methods available in the literature, image segmentation still a challenging problem in most of image processing applications. The challenge comes from the fuzziness of image objects and the overlapping of the different regions. Detection of edges in an image is a very important step towards understanding image features. There are large numbers of edge detection operators available, each designed to be sensitive to certain types of edges. The Quality of edge detection can be measured from several criteria objectively. Some criteria are proposed in terms of mathematical measurement, some of them are based on application and implementation requirements. Since edges often occur at image locations representing object boundaries, edge detection is extensively used in image segmentation when images are divided into areas corresponding to different objects. This can be used specifically for enhancing the tumor area in mammographic images. Different methods are available for edge detection like Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Log edge operators. In this paper a novel algorithms for edge detection has been proposed for mammographic images. Breast boundary, pectoral region and tumor location can be seen clearly by using this method. For comparison purpose Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, Log edge operators are used and their results are displayed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Additive or multiplicative stationary noise recently became an important issue in applied fields such as microscopy or satellite imaging. Relatively few works address the design of dedicated denoising methods compared to the usual white noise setting. We recently proposed a variational algorithm to tackle this issue. In this paper, we analyze this problem from a statistical point of view and provide deterministic properties of the solutions of the associated variational problems. In the first part of this work, we demonstrate that in many practical problems, the noise can be assimilated to a colored Gaussian noise. We provide a quantitative measure of the distance between a stationary process and the corresponding Gaussian process. In the second part, we focus on the Gaussian setting and analyze denoising methods which consist of minimizing the sum of a total variation term and an $l^2$ data fidelity term. While the constrained formulation of this problem allows to easily tune the parameters, the Lagrangian formulation can be solved more efficiently since the problem is strongly convex. Our second contribution consists in providing analytical values of the regularization parameter in order to approximately satisfy Morozov's discrepancy principle.

- **Summary**: Feature means countenance, remote sensing scene objects with similar characteristics, associated to interesting scene elements in the image formation process. They are classified into three types in image processing, that is low, middle and high. Low level features are color, texture and middle level feature is shape and high level feature is semantic gap of objects. An image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large image database. Content Based Image Retrieval is a technique which uses visual features of image such as color, shape, texture to search user required image from large image database according to user requests in the form of a query. MKNN is an enhancing method of KNN. The proposed KNN classification is called MKNN. MKNN contains two parts for processing, they are validity of the train samples and applying weighted KNN. The validity of each point is computed according to its neighbors. In our proposal, Modified K-Nearest Neighbor can be considered a kind of weighted KNN so that the query label is approximated by weighting the neighbors of the query.

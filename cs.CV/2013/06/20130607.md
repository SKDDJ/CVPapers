- **Summary**: Automatic face recognition (AFR) is an area with immense practical potential which includes a wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and it continues to be one of the most active research areas of computer vision. Even after over three decades of intense research, the state-of-the-art in AFR continues to improve, benefiting from advances in a range of different fields including image processing, pattern recognition, computer graphics and physiology. However, systems based on visible spectrum images continue to face challenges in the presence of illumination, pose and expression changes, as well as facial disguises, all of which can significantly decrease their accuracy. Amongst various approaches which have been proposed in an attempt to overcome these limitations, the use of infrared (IR) imaging has emerged as a particularly promising research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive and timely review of the literature on this subject.

- **Summary**: Over the course of the last decade, infrared (IR) and particularly thermal IR imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when applied in practice. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum illumination changes, IR data introduces specific challenges of its own, most notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for fitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which addresses these major challenges. Specifically, when comparing two thermal IR images of faces, we mutually normalize their poses and facial expressions by using an active appearance model (AAM) to generate synthetic images of the two faces with a neutral facial expression and in the same view (the average of the two input views). This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows AAM fitting. A major contribution of our work is the use of an AAM ensemble in which each AAM is specialized to a particular range of poses and a particular region of the thermal IR face space. Combined with the contributions from our previous work which addressed the problem of reliable AAM fitting in the thermal IR spectrum, and the development of a person-specific representation robust to transient changes in the pattern of facial temperature emissions, the proposed ensemble framework accurately matches faces across the full range of yaw from frontal to profile, even in the presence of scale variation (e.g. due to the varying distance of a subject from the camera).

- **Summary**: Over the course of the last decade, infrared (IR) and particularly thermal IR imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when applied in the real world. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum illumination changes, IR images introduce specific challenges of their own, most notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for fitting any deformable model. We describe a novel method which addresses these challenges. To normalize for pose and facial expression changes we generate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial expression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial expression. This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active appearance model (AAM) fitting. This is the first publication which explores the use of an AAM on thermal IR images; we propose a pre-processing step which enhances detail in thermal images, making AAM convergence faster and more accurate. To overcome the problem of thermal IR image sensitivity to the pattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on reliable anatomical features. In contrast to previous approaches, our representation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability of the extracted features. This makes the proposed representation much more robust both to pose and scale changes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the largest public database of thermal IR images of faces on which it achieved 100% identification, significantly outperforming previous methods.

- **Summary**: Single molecule fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technique for uncovering detailed information about biological systems, both in vitro and in vivo. In such experiments, the inherently low signal to noise ratios mean that accurate algorithms to separate true signal and background noise are essential to generate meaningful results. To this end, we have developed a new and robust method to reduce noise in single molecule fluorescence images by using a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) prior in a Bayesian framework. Two different strategies are proposed to build the prior - an intrinsic GMRF, with a stationary relationship between pixels and a heterogeneous intrinsic GMRF, with a differently weighted relationship between pixels classified as molecules and background. Testing with synthetic and real experimental fluorescence images demonstrates that the heterogeneous intrinsic GMRF is superior to other conventional de-noising approaches.

- **Summary**: We explain the orthogonal planes split (OPS) of quaternions based on the arbitrary choice of one or two linearly independent pure unit quaternions $f,g$. Next we systematically generalize the quaternionic Fourier transform (QFT) applied to quaternion fields to conform with the OPS determined by $f,g$, or by only one pure unit quaternion $f$, comment on their geometric meaning, and establish inverse transformations.

- **Summary**: The Liouville theorem states that bounded holomorphic complex functions are necessarily constant. Holomorphic functions fulfill the socalled Cauchy-Riemann (CR) conditions. The CR conditions mean that a complex $z$-derivative is independent of the direction. Holomorphic functions are ideal for activation functions of complex neural networks, but the Liouville theorem makes them useless. Yet recently the use of hyperbolic numbers, lead to the construction of hyperbolic number neural networks. We will describe the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for hyperbolic numbers and show that there exists a new interesting type of bounded holomorphic functions of hyperbolic numbers, which are not constant. We give examples of such functions. They therefore substantially expand the available candidates for holomorphic activation functions for hyperbolic number neural networks.   Keywords: Hyperbolic numbers, Liouville theorem, Cauchy-Riemann conditions, bounded holomorphic functions

- **Summary**: In this contribution we generalize the classical Fourier Mellin transform [S. Dorrode and F. Ghorbel, Robust and efficient Fourier-Mellin transform approximations for gray-level image reconstruction and complete invariant description, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 83(1) (2001), 57-78, DOI 10.1006/cviu.2001.0922.], which transforms functions $f$ representing, e.g., a gray level image defined over a compact set of $\mathbb{R}^2$. The quaternionic Fourier Mellin transform (QFMT) applies to functions $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$, for which $|f|$ is summable over $\mathbb{R}_+^* \times \mathbb{S}^1$ under the measure $d\theta \frac{dr}{r}$. $\mathbb{R}_+^*$ is the multiplicative group of positive and non-zero real numbers. We investigate the properties of the QFMT similar to the investigation of the quaternionic Fourier Transform (QFT) in [E. Hitzer, Quaternion Fourier Transform on Quaternion Fields and Generalizations, Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras, 17(3) (2007), 497-517.; E. Hitzer, Directional Uncertainty Principle for Quaternion Fourier Transforms, Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras, 20(2) (2010), 271-284, online since 08 July 2009.].

- **Summary**: A split hypercomplex learning algorithm for the training of nonlinear finite impulse response adaptive filters for the processing of hypercomplex signals of any dimension is proposed. The derivation strictly takes into account the laws of hypercomplex algebra and hypercomplex calculus, some of which have been neglected in existing learning approaches (e.g. for quaternions). Already in the case of quaternions we can predict improvements in performance of hypercomplex processes. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is rigorously analyzed.

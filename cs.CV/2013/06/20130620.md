- **Summary**: In contrast to most scientific disciplines, sports science research has been characterized by comparatively little effort investment in the development of relevant phenomenological models. Scarcer yet is the application of said models in practice. We present a framework which allows resistance training practitioners to employ a recently proposed neuromuscular model in actual training program design. The first novelty concerns the monitoring aspect of coaching. A method for extracting training performance characteristics from loosely constrained video sequences, effortlessly and with minimal human input, using computer vision is described. The extracted data is subsequently used to fit the underlying neuromuscular model. This is achieved by solving an inverse dynamics problem corresponding to a particular exercise. Lastly, a computer simulation of hypothetical training bouts, using athlete-specific capability parameters, is used to predict the effected adaptation and changes in performance. The software described here allows the practitioner to manipulate hypothetical training parameters and immediately see their effect on predicted adaptation for a specific athlete. Thus, this work presents a holistic view of the monitoring-assessment-adjustment loop.

- **Summary**: We propose a method which can detect events in videos by modeling the change in appearance of the event participants over time. This method makes it possible to detect events which are characterized not by motion, but by the changing state of the people or objects involved. This is accomplished by using object detectors as output models for the states of a hidden Markov model (HMM). The method allows an HMM to model the sequence of poses of the event participants over time, and is effective for poses of humans and inanimate objects. The ability to use existing object-detection methods as part of an event model makes it possible to leverage ongoing work in the object-detection community. A novel training method uses an EM loop to simultaneously learn the temporal structure and object models automatically, without the need to specify either the individual poses to be modeled or the frames in which they occur. The E-step estimates the latent assignment of video frames to HMM states, while the M-step estimates both the HMM transition probabilities and state output models, including the object detectors, which are trained on the weighted subset of frames assigned to their state. A new dataset was gathered because little work has been done on events characterized by changing object pose, and suitable datasets are not available. Our method produced results superior to that of comparison systems on this dataset.



### Analysing Word Importance for Image Annotation

- **Summary**: Image annotation provides several keywords automatically for a given image based on various tags to describe its contents which is useful in Image retrieval. Various researchers are working on text based and content based image annotations [7,9]. It is seen, in traditional Image annotation approaches, annotation words are treated equally without considering the importance of each word in real world. In context of this, in this work, images are annotated with keywords based on their frequency count and word correlation. Moreover this work proposes an approach to compute importance score of candidate keywords, having same frequency count.

- **Summary**: In a variety of applications, such as handwritten mathematics and diagram labelling, it is common to have symbols of many different sizes in use and for the writing not to follow simple baselines. In order to understand the scale and relative positioning of individual characters, it is necessary to identify the location of certain expected features. These are typically identified by particular points in the symbols, for example, the baseline of a lower case "p" would be identified by the lowest part of the bowl, ignoring the descender. We investigate how to find these special points automatically so they may be used in a number of problems, such as improving two-dimensional mathematical recognition and in handwriting neatening, while preserving the original style.

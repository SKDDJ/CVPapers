- **Summary**: 3D model retrieval techniques can be classified as histogram-based, view-based and graph-based approaches. We propose a hybrid shape descriptor which combines the global and local radial distance features by utilizing the histogram-based and view-based approaches respectively. We define an area-weighted global radial distance with respect to the center of the bounding sphere of the model and encode its distribution into a 2D histogram as the global radial distance shape descriptor. We then uniformly divide the bounding cube of a 3D model into a set of small cubes and define their centers as local centers. Then, we compute the local radial distance of a point based on the nearest local center. By sparsely sampling a set of views and encoding the local radial distance feature on the rendered views by color coding, we extract the local radial distance shape descriptor. Based on these two shape descriptors, we develop a hybrid radial distance shape descriptor for 3D model retrieval. Experiment results show that our hybrid shape descriptor outperforms several typical histogram-based and view-based approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper we address the problem of matching sets of vectors embedded in the same input space. We propose an approach which is motivated by canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a statistical technique which has proven successful in a wide variety of pattern recognition problems. Like CCA when applied to the matching of sets, our extended canonical correlation analysis (E-CCA) aims to extract the most similar modes of variability within two sets. Our first major contribution is the formulation of a principled framework for robust inference of such modes from data in the presence of uncertainty associated with noise and sampling randomness. E-CCA retains the efficiency and closed form computability of CCA, but unlike it, does not possess free parameters which cannot be inferred directly from data (inherent data dimensionality, and the number of canonical correlations used for set similarity computation). Our second major contribution is to show that in contrast to CCA, E-CCA is readily adapted to match sets in a discriminative learning scheme which we call discriminative extended canonical correlation analysis (DE-CCA). Theoretical contributions of this paper are followed by an empirical evaluation of its premises on the task of face recognition from sets of rasterized appearance images. The results demonstrate that our approach, E-CCA, already outperforms both CCA and its quasi-discriminative counterpart constrained CCA (C-CCA), for all values of their free parameters. An even greater improvement is achieved with the discriminative variant, DE-CCA.

- **Summary**: The k-means algorithm is a partitional clustering method. Over 60 years old, it has been successfully used for a variety of problems. The popularity of k-means is in large part a consequence of its simplicity and efficiency. In this paper we are inspired by these appealing properties of k-means in the development of a clustering algorithm which accepts the notion of "positively" and "negatively" labelled data. The goal is to discover the cluster structure of both positive and negative data in a manner which allows for the discrimination between the two sets. The usefulness of this idea is demonstrated practically on the problem of face recognition, where the task of learning the scope of a person's appearance should be done in a manner which allows this face to be differentiated from others.

- **Summary**: Piecewise constant image approximations of sequential number of segments or clusters of disconnected pixels are treated. The method of majorizing of optimal approximation sequence by hierarchical sequence of image approximations is proposed. A generalization for multidimensional case of color and multispectral images is foreseen.

- **Summary**: Correlation is a common technique for the detection of shifts. Its generalization to the multidimensional geometric correlation in Clifford algebras has been proven a useful tool for color image processing, because it additionally contains information about a rotational misalignment. But so far the exact correction of a three-dimensional outer rotation could only be achieved in certain special cases. In this paper we prove that applying the geometric correlation iteratively has the potential to detect the outer rotational misalignment for arbitrary three-dimensional vector fields. We further present the explicit iterative algorithm, analyze its efficiency detecting the rotational misalignment in the color space of a color image. The experiments suggest a method for the acceleration of the algorithm, which is practically tested with great success.

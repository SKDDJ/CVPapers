- **Summary**: We present the MDS feature learning framework, in which multidimensional scaling (MDS) is applied on high-level pairwise image distances to learn fixed-length vector representations of images. The aspects of the images that are captured by the learned features, which we call MDS features, completely depend on what kind of image distance measurement is employed. With properly selected semantics-sensitive image distances, the MDS features provide rich semantic information about the images that is not captured by other feature extraction techniques. In our work, we introduce the iterated Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solving MDS, and study the MDS feature learning with IMage Euclidean Distance (IMED) and Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) distance. We present experiments on both synthetic data and real images --- the publicly accessible UIUC car image dataset. The MDS features based on SPM distance achieve exceptional performance for the car recognition task.

- **Summary**: The problem of 3D object recognition is of immense practical importance, with the last decade witnessing a number of breakthroughs in the state of the art. Most of the previous work has focused on the matching of textured objects using local appearance descriptors extracted around salient image points. The recently proposed bag of boundaries method was the first to address directly the problem of matching smooth objects using boundary features. However, no previous work has attempted to achieve a holistic treatment of the problem by jointly using textural and shape features which is what we describe herein. Due to the complementarity of the two modalities, we fuse the corresponding matching scores and learn their relative weighting in a data specific manner by optimizing discriminative performance on synthetically distorted data. For the textural description of an object we adopt a representation in the form of a histogram of SIFT based visual words. Similarly the apparent shape of an object is represented by a histogram of discretized features capturing local shape. On a large public database of a diverse set of objects, the proposed method is shown to outperform significantly both purely textural and purely shape based approaches for matching across viewpoint variation.

- **Summary**: In some implementations of the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping formulation for image registration we consider the motion of particles which locally translate image data. We then lift the motion of the particles to obtain a motion on the entire image. However, it is certainly possible to consider particles which do more than translate, and this is what will be described in this paper. As the unreduced Lagrangian associated to EPDiff possesses $\Diff(M)$ symmetry, it must also exhibit $G \subset \Diff(M)$ symmetry, for any Lie subgroup. In this paper we will describe a tower of Lie groups $G^{(0)} \subseteq G^{(1)} \subseteq G^{(2)} \subseteq...$ which correspond to preserving $k$-th order jet-data. The reduced configuration spaces $Q^{(k)} := \Diff(M) / G^{(k)}$ will be finite-dimensional (in particular, $Q^{(0)}$ is the configuration manifold for $N$ particles in $M$). We will observe that $G^{(k)}$ is a normal subgroup of $G^{(0)}$ and so the quotient $G^{(0)} / G^{(k)}$ is itself a (finite dimensional) Lie group which acts on $Q^{(k)}$. This makes $Q^{(k)}$ a principle bundle over $Q^{(0)}$ and the reduced geodesic equations on $Q^{(k)}$ will possess $G^{(0)} / G^{(k)}$-symmetry. Noether's theorem implies the existence of conserved momenta for the reduced system on $T^{\ast}Q^{(k)}$.

- **Summary**: This report describes the design, implementation, evaluation and original enhancements to the Live-Wire method for 2D and 3D image segmentation. Live-Wire 2D employs a semi-automatic paradigm; the user is asked to select a few boundary points of the object to segment, to steer the process in the right direction, while the result is displayed in real time. In our implementation segmentation is extended to three dimensions by performing this process on a slice-by-slice basis. User's time and involvement is further reduced by allowing him to specify object contours in planes orthogonal to the slices. If these planes are chosen strategically, Live-Wire 3D can perform 2D segmentation in the plane of each slice automatically. This report also proposes two improvements to the original method, path heating and a new graph edge feature function based on variance of path properties along the boundary. We show that these improvements lead up to a 33% reduction in interaction with the user, and improved delineation in presence of strong interfering edges.



### Hyperparameter Optimization and Boosting for Classifying Facial Expressions: How good can a "Null" Model be?

- **Summary**: One of the goals of the ICML workshop on representation and learning is to establish benchmark scores for a new data set of labeled facial expressions. This paper presents the performance of a "Null" model consisting of convolutions with random weights, PCA, pooling, normalization, and a linear readout. Our approach focused on hyperparameter optimization rather than novel model components. On the Facial Expression Recognition Challenge held by the Kaggle website, our hyperparameter optimization approach achieved a score of 60% accuracy on the test data. This paper also introduces a new ensemble construction variant that combines hyperparameter optimization with the construction of ensembles. This algorithm constructed an ensemble of four models that scored 65.5% accuracy. These scores rank 12th and 5th respectively among the 56 challenge participants. It is worth noting that our approach was developed prior to the release of the data set, and applied without modification; our strong competition performance suggests that the TPE hyperparameter optimization algorithm and domain expertise encoded in our Null model can generalize to new image classification data sets.

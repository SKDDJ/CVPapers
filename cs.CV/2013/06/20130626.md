- **Summary**: The first competition on the binarization of historical Persian documents and manuscripts (PHIBC 2012) has been organized in conjunction with the first Iranian conference on pattern recognition and image analysis (PRIA 2013). The main objective of PHIBC 2012 is to evaluate performance of the binarization methodologies, when applied on the Persian heritage images. This paper provides a report on the methodology and performance of the three submitted algorithms based on evaluation measures has been used.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a image into different regions or groups based on some characteristics like color, texture, motion or shape etc. Active contours is a popular variational method for object segmentation in images, in which the user initializes a contour which evolves in order to optimize an objective function designed such that the desired object boundary is the optimal solution. Recently, imaging modalities that produce Manifold valued images have come up, for example, DT-MRI images, vector fields. The traditional active contour model does not work on such images. In this paper, we generalize the active contour model to work on Manifold valued images. As expected, our algorithm detects regions with similar Manifold values in the image. Our algorithm also produces expected results on usual gray-scale images, since these are nothing but trivial examples of Manifold valued images. As another application of our general active contour model, we perform texture segmentation on gray-scale images by first creating an appropriate Manifold valued image. We demonstrate segmentation results for manifold valued images and texture images.

- **Summary**: This paper describes a coded aperture and keyed exposure approach to compressive video measurement which admits a small physical platform, high photon efficiency, high temporal resolution, and fast reconstruction algorithms. The proposed projections satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and hence compressed sensing theory provides theoretical guarantees on the video reconstruction quality. Moreover, the projections can be easily implemented using existing optical elements such as spatial light modulators (SLMs). We extend these coded mask designs to novel dual-scale masks (DSMs) which enable the recovery of a coarse-resolution estimate of the scene with negligible computational cost. We develop fast numerical algorithms which utilize both temporal correlations and optical flow in the video sequence as well as the innovative structure of the projections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on short-wave infrared data.

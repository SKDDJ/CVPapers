- **Summary**: Texture is intuitively defined as a repeated arrangement of a basic pattern or object in an image. There is no mathematical definition of a texture though. The human visual system is able to identify and segment different textures in a given image. Automating this task for a computer is far from trivial. There are three major components of any texture segmentation algorithm: (a) The features used to represent a texture, (b) the metric induced on this representation space and (c) the clustering algorithm that runs over these features in order to segment a given image into different textures. In this paper, we propose an active contour based novel unsupervised algorithm for texture segmentation. We use intensity covariance matrices of regions as the defining feature of textures and find regions that have the most inter-region dissimilar covariance matrices using active contours. Since covariance matrices are symmetric positive definite, we use geodesic distance defined on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices PD(n) as a measure of dissimlarity between such matrices. We demonstrate performance of our algorithm on both artificial and real texture images.

- **Summary**: Photographs are considered to be the most powerful and trustworthy media of expression. For a long time, those were accepted as proves of evidences in varied fields such as journalism, forensic investigations, military intelligence, scientific research and publications, crime detection and legal proceedings, investigation of insurance claims, medical imaging etc. Today, digital images have completely replaced the conventional photographs from every sphere of life but unfortunately, they seldom enjoy the credibility of their conventional counterparts, thanks to the rapid advancements in the field of digital image processing. The increasing availability of low cost and sometimes free of cost image editing software such as Photoshop, Corel Paint Shop, Photoscape, PhotoPlus, GIMP and Pixelmator have made the tampering of digital images even more easier and a common practice. Now it has become quite impossible to say whether a photograph is a genuine camera output or a manipulated version of it just by looking at it. As a result, photographs have almost lost their reliability and place as proves of evidences in all fields. This is why digital image tamper detection has emerged as an important research area to establish the authenticity of digital photographs by separating the tampered lots from the original ones. This paper gives a brief history of image tampering and a state-of-the-art review of the tamper detection techniques.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel approach is introduced for classifying curves into proper families, according to their similarity. First, a mathematical quantity we call plane curvature is introduced and a number of propositions are stated and proved. Proper similarity measures of two curves are introduced and a subsequent statistical analysis is applied. First, the efficiency of the curve fitting process has been tested on 2 shapes datasets of reference. Next, the methodology has been applied to the very important problem of classifying 23 Byzantine codices and 46 Ancient inscriptions to their writers, thus achieving correct dating of their content. The inscriptions have been attributed to ten individual hands and the Byzantine codices to four writers.

- **Summary**: Image compression is an important filed in image processing. The science welcomes any tinny contribution that may increase the compression ratio by whichever insignificant percentage. Therefore, the essential contribution in this paper is to increase the compression ratio for the well known Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image file format. The contribution starts with converting the original PNG image into k-Modulus Method (k-MM). Practically, taking k equals to ten, and then the pixels in the constructed image will be integers divisible by ten. Since PNG uses Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, then the ability to reduce file size will increase according to the repetition in pixels in each k-by-k window according to the transformation done by k-MM. Experimental results show that the proposed technique (k-PNG) produces high compression ratio with smaller file size in comparison to the original PNG file.

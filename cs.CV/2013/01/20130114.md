- **Summary**: Unsupervised feature learning has shown impressive results for a wide range of input modalities, in particular for object classification tasks in computer vision. Using a large amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised feature learning methods are utilized to construct high-level representations that are discriminative enough for subsequently trained supervised classification algorithms. However, it has never been \emph{quantitatively} investigated yet how well unsupervised learning methods can find \emph{low-level representations} for image patches without any additional supervision. In this paper we examine the performance of pure unsupervised methods on a low-level correspondence task, a problem that is central to many Computer Vision applications. We find that a special type of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) performs comparably to hand-crafted descriptors. Additionally, a simple binarization scheme produces compact representations that perform better than several state-of-the-art descriptors.

- **Summary**: Both pixel-based scale saliency (PSS) and basis project methods focus on multiscale analysis of data content and structure. Their theoretical relations and practical combination are previously discussed. However, no models have ever been proposed for calculating scale saliency on basis-projected descriptors since then. This paper extend those ideas into mathematical models and implement them in the wavelet-based scale saliency (WSS). While PSS uses pixel-value descriptors, WSS treats wavelet sub-bands as basis descriptors. The paper discusses different wavelet descriptors: discrete wavelet transform (DWT), wavelet packet transform (DWPT), quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) and best basis quaternion wavelet packet transform (QWPTBB). WSS saliency maps of different descriptors are generated and compared against other saliency methods by both quantitative and quanlitative methods. Quantitative results, ROC curves, AUC values and NSS values are collected from simulations on Bruce and Kootstra image databases with human eye-tracking data as ground-truth. Furthermore, qualitative visual results of saliency maps are analyzed and compared against each other as well as eye-tracking data inclusive in the databases.

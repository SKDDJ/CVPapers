- **Summary**: Cascade classifiers are widely used in real-time object detection. Different from conventional classifiers that are designed for a low overall classification error rate, a classifier in each node of the cascade is required to achieve an extremely high detection rate and moderate false positive rate. Although there are a few reported methods addressing this requirement in the context of object detection, there is no principled feature selection method that explicitly takes into account this asymmetric node learning objective. We provide such an algorithm here. We show that a special case of the biased minimax probability machine has the same formulation as the linear asymmetric classifier (LAC) of Wu et al (2005). We then design a new boosting algorithm that directly optimizes the cost function of LAC. The resulting totally-corrective boosting algorithm is implemented by the column generation technique in convex optimization. Experimental results on object detection verify the effectiveness of the proposed boosting algorithm as a node classifier in cascade object detection, and show performance better than that of the current state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Digital Photo images are everywhere, on the covers of magazines, in newspapers, in courtrooms, and all over the Internet. We are exposed to them throughout the day and most of the time. Ease with which images can be manipulated; we need to be aware that seeing does not always imply believing. We propose methodologies to identify such unbelievable photo images and succeeded to identify forged region by given only the forged image. Formats are additive tag for every file system and contents are relatively expressed with extension based on most popular digital camera uses JPEG and Other image formats like png, bmp etc. We have designed algorithm running behind with the concept of abnormal anomalies and identify the forgery regions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, anew algorithm which is based on geometrical moments and local binary patterns (LBP) for content based image retrieval (CBIR) is proposed. In geometrical moments, each vector is compared with the all other vectors for edge map generation. The same concept is utilized at LBP calculation which is generating nine LBP patterns from a given 3x3 pattern. Finally, nine LBP histograms are calculated which are used as a feature vector for image retrieval. Moments are important features used in recognition of different types of images. Two experiments have been carried out for proving the worth of our algorithm. The results after being investigated shows a significant improvement in terms of their evaluation measures as compared to LBP and other existing transform domain techniques.

- **Summary**: Some types of medical and topographic imaging device produce images in which the pixel values are "phase-wrapped", i.e. measured modulus a known scalar. Phase unwrapping can be viewed as the problem of inferring the number of shifts between each and every pair of neighboring pixels, subject to an a priori preference for smooth surfaces, and subject to a zero curl constraint, which requires that the shifts must sum to 0 around every loop. We formulate phase unwrapping as a mean field inference problem in a Markov network, where the prior favors the zero curl constraint. We compare our mean field technique with the least squares method on a synthetic 100x100 image, and give results on a 512x512 synthetic aperture radar image from Sandia National Laboratories.<Long Text>

- **Summary**: A standard approach to approximate inference in state-space models isto apply a particle filter, e.g., the Condensation Algorithm.However, the performance of particle filters often varies significantlydue to their stochastic nature.We present a class of algorithms, called lattice particle filters, thatcircumvent this difficulty by placing the particles deterministicallyaccording to a Quasi-Monte Carlo integration rule.We describe a practical realization of this idea, discuss itstheoretical properties, and its efficiency.Experimental results with a synthetic 2D tracking problem show that thelattice particle filter is equivalent to a conventional particle filterthat has between 10 and 60% more particles, depending ontheir "sparsity" in the state-space.We also present results on inferring 3D human motion frommoving light displays.

- **Summary**: Human eye movement mechanisms (saccades) are very useful for scene analysis, including object representation and pattern recognition. In this letter, a Hopfield neural network to emulate saccades is proposed. The network uses an energy function that includes location and identification tasks. Computer simulation shows that the network performs those tasks cooperatively. The result suggests that the network is applicable to shift-invariant pattern recognition.

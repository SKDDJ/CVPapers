- **Summary**: Resonance frequencies can provide useful information on the deformation occurring during fracturing experiments or $CO_2$ management, complementary to the microseismic event distribution. An accurate time-frequency representation is of crucial importance prior to interpreting the cause of resonance frequencies during microseismic experiments. The popular methods of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and wavelet analysis have limitations in representing close frequencies and dealing with fast varying instantaneous frequencies and this is often the nature of microseismic signals. The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a promising tool to track these resonant frequencies and provide a detailed time-frequency representation. Here we apply the synchrosqueezing transform to microseismic signals and also show its potential to general seismic signal processing applications.

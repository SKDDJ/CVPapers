- **Summary**: We study the problem of tracking (causally estimating) a time sequence of sparse spatial signals with changing sparsity patterns, as well as other unknown states, from a sequence of nonlinear observations corrupted by (possibly) non-Gaussian noise. In many applications, particularly those in visual tracking, the unknown state can be split into a small dimensional part, e.g. global motion, and a spatial signal, e.g. illumination or shape deformation. The spatial signal is often well modeled as being sparse in some domain. For a long sequence, its sparsity pattern can change over time, although the changes are usually slow. To address the above problem, we propose a novel solution approach called Particle Filtered Modified-CS (PaFiMoCS). The key idea of PaFiMoCS is to importance sample for the small dimensional state vector, while replacing importance sampling by slow sparsity pattern change constrained posterior mode tracking for recovering the sparse spatial signal. We show that the problem of tracking moving objects across spatially varying illumination change is an example of the above problem and explain how to design PaFiMoCS for it. Experiments on both simulated data as well as on real videos with significant illumination changes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared with existing particle filter based tracking algorithms.

- **Summary**: In this thesis a new approach for touch detection on optical multi-touch devices is proposed that exploits the fact that the camera images reveal not only the actual touch points but also objects above the screen such as the hand or arm of a user. The touch processing relies on the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions algorithm for finding the users' fingertips in the camera image. The hierarchical structure of the generated extremal regions serves as a starting point for agglomerative clustering of the fingertips into hands. Furthermore, a heuristic is suggested that supports the identification of individual fingers as well as the distinction between left hands and right hands if all five fingers of a hand are in contact with the touch surface.   The evaluation confirmed that the system is robust against detection errors resulting from non-uniform illumination and reliably assigns touch points to individual hands based on the implicitly tracked context information. The efficient multi-threaded implementation handles two-handed input from multiple users in real-time.

- **Summary**: We extend the concept of optical flow to a dynamic non-Euclidean setting. Optical flow is traditionally computed from a sequence of flat images. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce variational motion estimation for images that are defined on an evolving surface. Volumetric microscopy images depicting a live zebrafish embryo serve as both biological motivation and test data.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advances of microarray technologies, large amounts of high-dimensional gene expression data are being generated, which poses significant computational challenges. A first step towards addressing this challenge is the use of clustering techniques, which is essential in the data mining process to reveal natural structures and identify interesting patterns in the underlying data. A robust gene expression clustering approach to minimize undesirable clustering is proposed. In this paper, Penalized Fuzzy C-Means (PFCM) Clustering algorithm is described and compared with the most representative off-line clustering techniques: K-Means Clustering, Rough K-Means Clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering. These techniques are implemented and tested for a Brain Tumor gene expression Dataset. Analysis of the performance of the proposed approach is presented through qualitative validation experiments. From experimental results, it can be observed that Penalized Fuzzy C-Means algorithm shows a much higher usability than the other projected clustering algorithms used in our comparison study. Significant and promising clustering results are presented using Brain Tumor Gene expression dataset. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. In these clustering results, we find that Penalized Fuzzy C-Means algorithm provides useful information as an aid to diagnosis in oncology.

- **Summary**: Numerous approaches in image processing and computer vision are making use of super-pixels as a pre-processing step. Among the different methods producing such over-segmentation of an image, the graph-based approach of Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher is broadly employed. One of its interesting properties is that the regions are computed in a greedy manner in quasi-linear time. The algorithm may be trivially extended to video segmentation by considering a video as a 3D volume, however, this can not be the case for causal segmentation, when subsequent frames are unknown. We propose an efficient video segmentation approach that computes temporally consistent pixels in a causal manner, filling the need for causal and real time applications.

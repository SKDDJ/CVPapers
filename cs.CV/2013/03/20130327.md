- **Summary**: Automatic feature extraction domain has witnessed the application of many intelligent methodologies over past decade; however detection accuracy of these approaches were limited as object geometry and contextual knowledge were not given enough consideration. In this paper, we propose a frame work for accurate detection of features along with automatic interpolation, and interpretation by modeling feature shape as well as contextual knowledge using advanced techniques such as SVRF, Cellular Neural Network, Core set, and MACA. Developed methodology has been compared with contemporary methods using different statistical measures. Investigations over various satellite images revealed that considerable success was achieved with the CNN approach. CNN has been effective in modeling different complex features effectively and complexity of the approach has been considerably reduced using corset optimization. The system has dynamically used spectral and spatial information for representing contextual knowledge using CNN-prolog approach. System has been also proved to be effective in providing intelligent interpolation and interpretation of random features.

- **Summary**: Entropy is the measure of uncertainty in any data and is adopted for maximisation of mutual information in many remote sensing operations. The availability of wide entropy variations motivated us for an investigation over the suitability preference of these versions to specific operations. Methodologies were implemented in Matlab and were enhanced with entropy variations. Evaluation of various implementations was based on different statistical parameters with reference to the study area The popular available versions like Tsalli's, Shanon's, and Renyi's entropies were analysed in context of various remote sensing operations namely thresholding, clustering and registration.

- **Summary**: Image registration is the process of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system and is required for various remote sensing applications like change detection, image fusion, and other related areas. The effect of increased relief displacement, requirement of more control points, and increased data volume are the challenges associated with the registration of high resolution image data. The objective of this research work is to study the most efficient techniques and to investigate the extent of improvement achievable by enhancing them with Wavelet transform. The SIFT feature based method uses the Eigen value for extracting thousands of key points based on scale invariant features and these feature points when further enhanced by the wavelet transform yields the best results.

- **Summary**: We show an approach to automated control of machine vision systems based on incremental creation and evaluation of a particular family of influence diagrams that represent hypotheses of imagery interpretation and possible subsequent processing decisions. In our approach, model-based machine vision techniques are integrated with hierarchical Bayesian inference to provide a framework for representing and matching instances of objects and relationships in imagery and for accruing probabilities to rank order conflicting scene interpretations. We extend a result of Tatman and Shachter to show that the sequence of processing decisions derived from evaluating the diagrams at each stage is the same as the sequence that would have been derived by evaluating the final influence diagram that contains all random variables created during the run of the vision system.

- **Summary**: Several key issues arise in implementing computer vision recognition of world objects in terms of Bayesian networks. Computational efficiency is a driving force. Perceptual networks are very deep, typically fifteen levels of structure. Images are wide, e.g., an unspecified-number of edges may appear anywhere in an image 512 x 512 pixels or larger. For efficiency, we dynamically instantiate hypotheses of observed objects. The network is not fixed, but is created incrementally at runtime. Generation of hypotheses of world objects and indexing of models for recognition are important, but they are not considered here [4,11]. This work is aimed at near-term implementation with parallel computation in a radar surveillance system, ADRIES [5, 15], and a system for industrial part recognition, SUCCESSOR [2]. For many applications, vision must be faster to be practical and so efficiently controlling the machine vision process is critical. Perceptual operators may scan megapixels and may require minutes of computation time. It is necessary to avoid unnecessary sensor actions and computation. Parallel computation is available at several levels of processor capability. The potential for parallel, distributed computation for high-level vision means distributing non-homogeneous computations. This paper addresses the problem of task control in machine vision systems based on Bayesian probability models. We separate control and inference to extend the previous work [3] to maximize utility instead of probability. Maximizing utility allows adopting perceptual strategies for efficient information gathering with sensors and analysis of sensor data. Results of controlling machine vision via utility to recognize military situations are presented in this paper. Future work extends this to industrial part recognition for SUCCESSOR.

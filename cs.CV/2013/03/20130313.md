- **Summary**: Computing the relative motion of objects is an important navigation task that we routinely perform by relying on inherently unreliable biological cells in the retina. The non-linear and adaptive response of memristive devices make them excellent building blocks for realizing complex synaptic-like architectures that are common in the human retina. Here, we introduce a novel memristive thresholding scheme that facilitates the detection of moving edges. In addition, a double-layered 3-D memristive network is employed for modeling the motion computations that take place in both the Outer Plexiform Layer (OPL) and Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL) that enables the detection of on-center and off-center transient responses. Applying the transient detection results, it is shown that it is possible to generate an estimation of the speed and direction a moving object.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we use statistical texture features for handwritten and printed text classification. We primarily aim for word level classification in south Indian scripts. Words are first extracted from the scanned document. For each extracted word, statistical texture features are computed such as mean, standard deviation, smoothness, moment, uniformity, entropy and local range including local entropy. These feature vectors are then used to classify words via k-NN classifier. We have validated the approach over several different datasets. Scripts like Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi i.e., Devanagari are primarily employed where an average classification rate of 99.26% is achieved. In addition, to provide an extensibility of the approach, we address Roman script by using publicly available dataset and interesting results are reported.

- **Summary**: Egocentric vision technology consists in capturing the actions of persons from their own visual point of view using wearable camera sensors. We apply this new paradigm to instrumental activities monitoring with the objective of providing new tools for the clinical evaluation of the impact of the disease on persons with dementia. In this paper, we introduce the current state of the development of this technology and focus on two technology modules: automatic location estimation and visual saliency estimation for content interpretation.

- **Summary**: This article offers a modification of Chow and Liu's learning algorithm in the context of handwritten digit recognition. The modified algorithm directs the user to group digits into several classes consisting of digits that are hard to distinguish and then constructing an optimal conditional tree representation for each class of digits instead of for each single digit as done by Chow and Liu (1968). Advantages and extensions of the new method are discussed. Related works of Wong and Wang (1977) and Wong and Poon (1989) which offer a different entropy-based learning algorithm are shown to rest on inappropriate assumptions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for texture analysis based on artificial crawler model. Our method assumes that each agent can interact with the environment and each other. The evolution process converges to an equilibrium state according to the set of rules. For each textured image, the feature vector is composed by signatures of the live agents curve at each time. Experimental results revealed that combining the minimum and maximum signatures into one increase the classification rate. In addition, we pioneer the use of autonomous agents for characterizing silk fibroin scaffolds. The results strongly suggest that our approach can be successfully employed for texture analysis.

- **Summary**: We present a unifying framework which reduces the construction of probabilistic component analysis techniques to a mere selection of the latent neighbourhood, thus providing an elegant and principled framework for creating novel component analysis models as well as constructing probabilistic equivalents of deterministic component analysis methods. Under our framework, we unify many very popular and well-studied component analysis algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) and Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), some of which have no probabilistic equivalents in literature thus far. We firstly define the Markov Random Fields (MRFs) which encapsulate the latent connectivity of the aforementioned component analysis techniques; subsequently, we show that the projection directions produced by all PCA, LDA, LPP and SFA are also produced by the Maximum Likelihood (ML) solution of a single joint probability density function, composed by selecting one of the defined MRF priors while utilising a simple observation model. Furthermore, we propose novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms, exploiting the proposed joint PDF, while we generalize the proposed methodologies to arbitrary connectivities via parameterizable MRF products. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both simulated and real world data show the usefulness of the proposed framework, by deriving methods which well outperform state-of-the-art equivalents.

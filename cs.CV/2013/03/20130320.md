- **Summary**: Visual object tracking is a significant computer vision task which can be applied to many domains such as visual surveillance, human computer interaction, and video compression. In the literature, researchers have proposed a variety of 2D appearance models. To help readers swiftly learn the recent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two different processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling. Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The contributions of this survey are four-fold. First, we review the literature of visual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques is analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint. Fourth, the existing benchmark resources (e.g., source code and video datasets) are examined in this survey.

- **Summary**: Handwriting recognition refers to the identification of written characters. Handwriting recognition has become an acute research area in recent years for the ease of access of computer science. In this paper primarily discussed On-line and Off-line handwriting recognition methods for Arabic words which are often used among then across the Middle East and North Africa People. Arabic word online handwriting recognition is a very challenging task due to its cursive nature. Because of the characteristic of the whole body of the Arabic script, namely connectivity between the characters, thereby the segmentation of An Arabic script is very difficult. In this paper we introduced an Arabic script multiple classifier system for recognizing notes written on a Starboard. This Arabic script multiple classifier system combines one off-line and on-line handwriting recognition systems. The Arabic script recognizers are all based on Hidden Markov Models but vary in the way of preprocessing and normalization. To combine the Arabic script output sequences of the recognizers, we incrementally align the word sequences using a norm string matching algorithm. The Arabic script combination we could increase the system performance over the excellent character recognizer by about 3%. The proposed technique is also the necessary step towards character recognition, person identification, personality determination where input data is processed from all perspectives.

- **Summary**: A variety of operations of cellular automata on gray images is presented. All operations are of a wave-front nature finishing in a stable state. They are used to extract shape descripting gray objects robust to a variety of pattern distortions. Topographic terms are used: "lakes", "dales", "dales of dales". It is shown how mutual object relations like "above" can be presented in terms of gray image analysis and how it can be used for character classification and for gray pattern decomposition. Algorithms can be realized with a parallel asynchronous architecture. Keywords: Pattern Recognition, Mathematical Morphology, Cellular Automata, Wave-front Algorithms, Gray Image Analysis, Topographical Shape Descriptors, Asynchronous Parallel Processors, Holes, Cavities, Concavities, Graphs.

- **Summary**: We proposed an algorithm for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equation associated to an optimal trajectory problem for a vehicle moving inside the pre-specified domain with the speed depending upon the direction of the motion and current position of the vehicle. The dynamics of the vehicle is defined by an ordinary differential equation, the right hand of which is given by product of control(a time dependent fuction) and a function dependent on trajectory and control. At some unspecified terminal time, the vehicle reaches the boundary of the pre-specified domain and incurs a terminal cost. We also associate the traveling cost with a type of integral to the trajectory followed by vehicle. We are interested in a numerical method for finding a trajectory that minimizes the sum of the traveling cost and terminal cost. We developed an algorithm solving the value function for general trajectory optimization problem. Our algorithm is closely related to the Tsitsiklis's Fast Marching Method and J. A. Sethian's OUM and SLF-LLL[1-4] and is a generalization of them. On the basis of these results, We applied our algorithm to the image processing such as fingerprint verification.

- **Summary**: This paper describes a novel method for partitioning image into meaningful segments. The proposed method employs watershed transform, a well-known image segmentation technique. Along with that, it uses various auxiliary schemes such as Binary Gradient Masking, dilation which segment the image in proper way. The algorithm proposed in this paper considers all these methods in effective way and takes little time. It is organized in such a manner so that it operates on input image adaptively. Its robustness and efficiency makes it more convenient and suitable for all types of images.

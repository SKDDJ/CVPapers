- **Summary**: Methodological contributions: This paper introduces a family of kernels for analyzing (anatomical) trees endowed with vector valued measurements made along the tree. While state-of-the-art graph and tree kernels use combinatorial tree/graph structure with discrete node and edge labels, the kernels presented in this paper can include geometric information such as branch shape, branch radius or other vector valued properties. In addition to being flexible in their ability to model different types of attributes, the presented kernels are computationally efficient and some of them can easily be computed for large datasets (N of the order 10.000) of trees with 30-600 branches. Combining the kernels with standard machine learning tools enables us to analyze the relation between disease and anatomical tree structure and geometry. Experimental results: The kernels are used to compare airway trees segmented from low-dose CT, endowed with branch shape descriptors and airway wall area percentage measurements made along the tree. Using kernelized hypothesis testing we show that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy individuals. The geometric tree kernels also give a significant increase in the classification accuracy of COPD from geometric tree structure endowed with airway wall thickness measurements in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, giving further insight into the relationship between airway wall thickness and COPD.

- **Summary**: This work presents an automatic human gender and age group recognition system based on human facial images. It makes an extensive experiment with row pixel intensity valued features and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficient features with Principal Component Analysis and k-Nearest Neighbor classification to identify the best recognition approach. The final results show approaches using DCT coefficient outperform their counter parts resulting in a 99% correct gender recognition rate and 68% correct age group recognition rate (considering four distinct age groups) in unseen test images. Detailed experimental settings and obtained results are clearly presented and explained in this report.

- **Summary**: The two-dimensional Gabor function is adapted to natural image statistics, leading to a tractable probabilistic generative model that can be used to model simple-cell receptive-field profiles, or generate basis functions for sparse coding applications. Learning is found to be most pronounced in three Gabor-function parameters representing the size and spatial frequency of the two-dimensional Gabor function, and characterized by a non-uniform probability distribution with heavy tails. All three parameters are found to be strongly correlated: resulting in a basis of multiscale Gabor functions with similar aspect ratios, and size-dependent spatial frequencies. A key finding is that the distribution of receptive-field sizes is scale-invariant over a wide range of values, so there is no characteristic receptive-field size selected by natural image statistics. The Gabor-function aspect ratio is found to be approximately conserved by the learning rules and is therefore not well-determined by natural image statistics. This allows for three distinct solutions: a basis of Gabor functions with sharp orientation resolution at the expense of spatial-frequency resolution; a basis of Gabor functions with sharp spatial-frequency resolution at the expense of orientation resolution; or a basis with unit aspect ratio. Arbitrary mixtures of all three cases are also possible. Two parameters controlling the shape of the marginal distributions in a probabilistic generative model fully account for all three solutions. The best-performing probabilistic generative model for sparse coding applications is found to be a Gaussian copula with Pareto marginal probability density functions.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses signal denoising when large-amplitude coefficients form clusters (groups). The L1-norm and other separable sparsity models do not capture the tendency of coefficients to cluster (group sparsity). This work develops an algorithm, called 'overlapping group shrinkage' (OGS), based on the minimization of a convex cost function involving a group-sparsity promoting penalty function. The groups are fully overlapping so the denoising method is translation-invariant and blocking artifacts are avoided. Based on the principle of majorization-minimization (MM), we derive a simple iterative minimization algorithm that reduces the cost function monotonically. A procedure for setting the regularization parameter, based on attenuating the noise to a specified level, is also described. The proposed approach is illustrated on speech enhancement, wherein the OGS approach is applied in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. The denoised speech produced by OGS does not suffer from musical noise.



### Registration of Images with Outliers Using Joint Saliency Map

- **Summary**: Mutual information (MI) is a popular similarity measure for image registration, whereby good registration can be achieved by maximizing the compactness of the clusters in the joint histogram. However, MI is sensitive to the "outlier" objects that appear in one image but not the other, and also suffers from local and biased maxima. We propose a novel joint saliency map (JSM) to highlight the corresponding salient structures in the two images, and emphatically group those salient structures into the smoothed compact clusters in the weighted joint histogram. This strategy could solve both the outlier and the local maxima problems. Experimental results show that the JSM-MI based algorithm is not only accurate but also robust for registration of challenging image pairs with outliers.

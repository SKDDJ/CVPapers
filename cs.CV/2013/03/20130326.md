- **Summary**: Balancing computational efficiency with recognition accuracy is one of the major challenges in real-world video-based face recognition. A significant design decision for any such system is whether to process and use all possible faces detected over the video frames, or whether to select only a few "best" faces. This paper presents a video face recognition system based on probabilistic Multi-Region Histograms to characterise performance trade-offs in: (i) selecting a subset of faces compared to using all faces, and (ii) combining information from all faces via clustering. Three face selection metrics are evaluated for choosing a subset: face detection confidence, random subset, and sequential selection. Experiments on the recently introduced MOBIO dataset indicate that the usage of all faces through clustering always outperformed selecting only a subset of faces. The experiments also show that the face selection metric based on face detection confidence generally provides better recognition performance than random or sequential sampling. Moreover, the optimal number of faces varies drastically across selection metric and subsets of MOBIO. Given the trade-offs between computational effort, recognition accuracy and robustness, it is recommended that face feature clustering would be most advantageous in batch processing (particularly for video-based watchlists), whereas face selection methods should be limited to applications with significant computational restrictions.

- **Summary**: Using the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator we simulate fractal surfaces as random series of eigenfunctions. This approach allows us to generate random fields over smooth manifolds of arbitrary dimension, generalizing previous work with fractional Brownian motion with multi-dimensional parameter. We give examples of surfaces with and without boundary and discuss implementation.

- **Summary**: Many interpolation methods have been developed for high visual quality, but fail for inability to preserve image structures. Edges carry heavy structural information for detection, determination and classification. Edge-adaptive interpolation approaches become a center of focus. In this paper, performance of four edge-directed interpolation methods comparing with two traditional methods is evaluated on two groups of images. These methods include new edge-directed interpolation (NEDI), edge-guided image interpolation (EGII), iterative curvature-based interpolation (ICBI), directional cubic convolution interpolation (DCCI) and two traditional approaches, bi-linear and bi-cubic. Meanwhile, no parameters are mentioned to measure edge-preserving ability of edge-adaptive interpolation approaches and we proposed two. One evaluates accuracy and the other measures robustness of edge-preservation ability. Performance evaluation is based on six parameters. Objective assessment and visual analysis are illustrated and conclusions are drawn from theoretical backgrounds and practical results.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing techniques are widely used for land cover classification and urban analysis. The availability of high resolution remote sensing imagery limits the level of classification accuracy attainable from pixel-based approach. In this paper object-based classification scheme based on a hierarchical support vector machine is introduced. By combining spatial and spectral information, the amount of overlap between classes can be decreased; thereby yielding higher classification accuracy and more accurate land cover maps. We have adopted certain automatic approaches based on the advanced techniques as Cellular automata and Genetic Algorithm for kernel and tuning parameter selection. Performance evaluation of the proposed methodology in comparison with the existing approaches is performed with reference to the Bhopal city study area.

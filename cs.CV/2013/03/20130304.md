- **Summary**: Driven by the significant advancements in technology and social issues such as security management, there is a strong need for Smart Surveillance System in our society today. One of the key features of a Smart Surveillance System is efficient human detection and counting such that the system can decide and label events on its own. In this paper we propose a new, novel and robust model, The Omega Model, for detecting and counting human beings present in the scene. The proposed model employs a set of four distinct descriptors for identifying the unique features of the head, neck and shoulder regions of a person. This unique head neck shoulder signature given by the Omega Model exploits the challenges such as inter person variations in size and shape of peoples head, neck and shoulder regions to achieve robust detection of human beings even under partial occlusion, dynamically changing background and varying illumination conditions. After experimentation we observe and analyze the influences of each of the four descriptors on the system performance and computation speed and conclude that a weight based decision making system produces the best results. Evaluation results on a number of images indicate the validation of our method in actual situation.

- **Summary**: Sign Language Recognition is one of the most growing fields of research today. Many new techniques have been developed recently in these fields. Here in this paper, we have proposed a system using Eigen value weighted Euclidean distance as a classification technique for recognition of various Sign Languages of India. The system comprises of four parts: Skin Filtering, Hand Cropping, Feature Extraction and Classification. Twenty four signs were considered in this paper, each having ten samples, thus a total of two hundred forty images was considered for which recognition rate obtained was 97 percent.

- **Summary**: In this paper, an Eigenvector based system has been presented to recognize facial expressions from digital facial images. In the approach, firstly the images were acquired and cropping of five significant portions from the image was performed to extract and store the Eigenvectors specific to the expressions. The Eigenvectors for the test images were also computed, and finally the input facial image was recognized when similarity was obtained by calculating the minimum Euclidean distance between the test image and the different expressions.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation is referred to the segmentation of known anatomic structures from different medical images. Normally, the medical data researches are more complicated and an exclusive structures. This computer aided diagnosis is used for assisting doctors in evaluating medical imagery or in recognizing abnormal findings in a medical image. To integrate the specialized knowledge for medical data processing is helpful to form a real useful healthcare decision making system. This paper studies the different symmetry based distances applied in clustering algorithms and analyzes symmetry approach for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan image segmentation. Unlike CT and MRI, the PET scan identifies the structure of blood flow to and from organs. PET scan also helps in early diagnosis of cancer and heart, brain and gastro intestinal ailments and to detect the progress of treatment. In this paper, the scope diagnostic task expands for PET image in various brain functions.

- **Summary**: Recognition of epileptic focal point is the important diagnosis when screening the epilepsy patients for latent surgical cures. The accurate localization is challenging one because of the low spatial resolution images with more noisy data. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has now replaced the issues and caring a high resolution. This paper focuses the research of automated localization of epileptic seizures in brain functional images using symmetry based cluster approach. This approach presents a fully automated symmetry based brain abnormality detection method for PET sequences. PET images are spatially normalized to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard and then it has been trained using symmetry based cluster approach using Medical Image Processing, Analysis & Visualization (MIPAV) tool. The performance evolution is considered by the metric like accuracy of diagnosis. The obtained result is surely assists the surgeon for the automated identification of seizures focus.

- **Summary**: Nuclear image has emerged as a promising research work in medical field. Images from different modality meet its own challenge. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) image may help to precisely localize disease to assist in planning the right treatment for each case and saving valuable time. In this paper, a novel approach of Spatial Fuzzy C Means (PET SFCM) clustering algorithm is introduced on PET scan image datasets. The proposed algorithm is incorporated the spatial neighborhood information with traditional FCM and updating the objective function of each cluster. This algorithm is implemented and tested on huge data collection of patients with brain neuro degenerative disorder such as Alzheimers disease. It has demonstrated its effectiveness by testing it for real world patient data sets. Experimental results are compared with conventional FCM and K Means clustering algorithm. The performance of the PET SFCM provides satisfactory results compared with other two algorithms

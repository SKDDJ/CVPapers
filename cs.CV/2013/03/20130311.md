- **Summary**: Clustering is a separation of data into groups of similar objects. Every group called cluster consists of objects that are similar to one another and dissimilar to objects of other groups. In this paper, the K-Means algorithm is implemented by three distance functions and to identify the optimal distance function for clustering methods. The proposed K-Means algorithm is compared with K-Means, Static Weighted K-Means (SWK-Means) and Dynamic Weighted K-Means (DWK-Means) algorithm by using Davis Bouldin index, Execution Time and Iteration count methods. Experimental results show that the proposed K-Means algorithm performed better on Iris and Wine dataset when compared with other three clustering methods.

- **Summary**: Signal space models in both phase-encode, and frequency-encode directions are presented for extrapolation of 2D partial kspace. Using the boxcar representation of low-resolution spatial data, and a geometrical representation of signal space vectors in both positive and negative phase-encode directions, a robust predictor is constructed using a series of signal space projections. Compared to some of the existing phase-correction methods that require acquisition of a pre-determined set of fractional kspace lines, the proposed predictor is found to be more efficient, due to its capability of exhibiting an equivalent degree of performance using only half the number of fractional lines. Robust filtering of noisy data is achieved using a second signal space model in the frequency-encode direction, bypassing the requirement of a prior highpass filtering operation. The signal space is constructed from Fourier Transformed samples of each row in the low-resolution image. A set of FIR filters are estimated by fitting a least squares model to this signal space. Partial kspace extrapolation using the FIR filters is shown to result in artifact-free reconstruction, particularly in respect of Gibbs ringing and streaking type artifacts.

- **Summary**: We present an edge preserving and denoising filter for enhancing the features in images, which contain an ROI having a narrow spatial extent. Typical examples include angiograms, or ROI spatially distributed in multiple locations and contained within an outlying region, such as in multiple-sclerosis. The filtering involves determination of multiplicative weights in the spatial domain using an extended set of neighborhood directions. Equivalently, the filtering operation may be interpreted as a combination of directional filters in the frequency domain, with selective weighting for spatial frequencies contained within each direction. The advantages of the proposed filter in comparison to specialized non-linear filters, which operate on diffusion principle, are illustrated using numerical phantom data. The performance evaluation is carried out on simulated images from BrainWeb database for multiple-sclerosis, acute ischemic stroke using clinically acquired FLAIR images and MR angiograms.

- **Summary**: For the purposes of foreground estimation, the true background model is unavailable in many practical circumstances and needs to be estimated from cluttered image sequences. We propose a sequential technique for static background estimation in such conditions, with low computational and memory requirements. Image sequences are analysed on a block-by-block basis. For each block location a representative set is maintained which contains distinct blocks obtained along its temporal line. The background estimation is carried out in a Markov Random Field framework, where the optimal labelling solution is computed using iterated conditional modes. The clique potentials are computed based on the combined frequency response of the candidate block and its neighbourhood. It is assumed that the most appropriate block results in the smoothest response, indirectly enforcing the spatial continuity of structures within a scene. Experiments on real-life surveillance videos demonstrate that the proposed method obtains considerably better background estimates (both qualitatively and quantitatively) than median filtering and the recently proposed "intervals of stable intensity" method. Further experiments on the Wallflower dataset suggest that the combination of the proposed method with a foreground segmentation algorithm results in improved foreground segmentation.

- **Summary**: Many standard approaches for geometric model fitting are based on pre-matched image features. Typically, such pre-matching uses only feature appearances (e.g. SIFT) and a large number of non-unique features must be discarded in order to control the false positive rate. In contrast, we solve feature matching and multi-model fitting problems in a joint optimization framework. This paper proposes several fit-&-match energy formulations based on a generalization of the assignment problem. We developed an efficient solver based on min-cost-max-flow algorithm that finds near optimal solutions. Our approach significantly increases the number of detected matches. In practice, energy-based joint fitting & matching allows to increase the distance between view-points previously restricted by robustness of local SIFT-matching and to improve the model fitting accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art multi-model fitting techniques.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose sparse coding-based approaches for segmentation of tumor regions from MR images. Sparse coding with data-adapted dictionaries has been successfully employed in several image recovery and vision problems. The proposed approaches obtain sparse codes for each pixel in brain magnetic resonance images considering their intensity values and location information. Since it is trivial to obtain pixel-wise sparse codes, and combining multiple features in the sparse coding setup is not straightforward, we propose to perform sparse coding in a high-dimensional feature space where non-linear similarities can be effectively modeled. We use the training data from expert-segmented images to obtain kernel dictionaries with the kernel K-lines clustering procedure. For a test image, sparse codes are computed with these kernel dictionaries, and they are used to identify the tumor regions. This approach is completely automated, and does not require user intervention to initialize the tumor regions in a test image. Furthermore, a low complexity segmentation approach based on kernel sparse codes, which allows the user to initialize the tumor region, is also presented. Results obtained with both the proposed approaches are validated against manual segmentation by an expert radiologist, and the proposed methods lead to accurate tumor identification.

- **Summary**: A new classifier for Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images is proposed and assessed in this paper. Its input consists of segments, and each one is assigned the class which minimizes a stochastic distance. Assuming the complex Wishart model, several stochastic distances are obtained from the h-phi family of divergences, and they are employed to derive hypothesis test statistics that are also used in the classification process. This article also presents, as a novelty, analytic expressions for the test statistics based on the following stochastic distances between complex Wishart models: Kullback-Leibler, Bhattacharyya, Hellinger, R\'enyi, and Chi-Square; also, the test statistic based on the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian distributions is presented. The classifier performance is evaluated using simulated and real PolSAR data. The simulated data are based on the complex Wishart model, aiming at the analysis of the proposal well controlled data. The real data refer to the complex L-band image, acquired during the 1994 SIR-C mission. The results of the proposed classifier are compared with those obtained by a Wishart per-pixel/contextual classifier, and we show the better performance of the region-based classification. The influence of the statistical modeling is assessed by comparing the results using the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian distributions for amplitude data. The results with simulated data indicate that the proposed classification method has a very good performance when the data follow the Wishart model. The proposed classifier also performs better than the per-pixel/contextual classifier and the Bhattacharyya Gaussian distance using SIR-C PolSAR data.

- **Summary**: In this paper we study the bilateral filter proposed by Tomasi and Manduchi, as a spectral domain transform defined on a weighted graph. The nodes of this graph represent the pixels in the image and a graph signal defined on the nodes represents the intensity values. Edge weights in the graph correspond to the bilateral filter coefficients and hence are data adaptive. Spectrum of a graph is defined in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. We use this spectral interpretation to generalize the bilateral filter and propose more flexible and application specific spectral designs of bilateral-like filters. We show that these spectral filters can be implemented with k-iterative bilateral filtering operations and do not require expensive diagonalization of the Laplacian matrix.

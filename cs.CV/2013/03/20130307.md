- **Summary**: In the field of face recognition, Sparse Representation (SR) has received considerable attention during the past few years. Most of the relevant literature focuses on holistic descriptors in closed-set identification applications. The underlying assumption in SR-based methods is that each class in the gallery has sufficient samples and the query lies on the subspace spanned by the gallery of the same class. Unfortunately, such assumption is easily violated in the more challenging face verification scenario, where an algorithm is required to determine if two faces (where one or both have not been seen before) belong to the same person. In this paper, we first discuss why previous attempts with SR might not be applicable to verification problems. We then propose an alternative approach to face verification via SR. Specifically, we propose to use explicit SR encoding on local image patches rather than the entire face. The obtained sparse signals are pooled via averaging to form multiple region descriptors, which are then concatenated to form an overall face descriptor. Due to the deliberate loss spatial relations within each region (caused by averaging), the resulting descriptor is robust to misalignment & various image deformations. Within the proposed framework, we evaluate several SR encoding techniques: l1-minimisation, Sparse Autoencoder Neural Network (SANN), and an implicit probabilistic technique based on Gaussian Mixture Models. Thorough experiments on AR, FERET, exYaleB, BANCA and ChokePoint datasets show that the proposed local SR approach obtains considerably better and more robust performance than several previous state-of-the-art holistic SR methods, in both verification and closed-set identification problems. The experiments also show that l1-minimisation based encoding has a considerably higher computational than the other techniques, but leads to higher recognition rates.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach for the automatic license plate recognition, which includes the SIFT algorithm in step to locate the plate in the input image. In this new approach, besides the comparison of the features obtained with the SIFT algorithm, the correspondence between the spatial orientations and the positioning associated with the keypoints is also observed. Afterwards, an algorithm is used for the character recognition of the plates, very fast, which makes it possible its application in real time. The results obtained with the proposed approach presented very good success rates, so much for locating the characters in the input image, as for their recognition.

- **Summary**: Energies with high-order non-submodular interactions have been shown to be very useful in vision due to their high modeling power. Optimization of such energies, however, is generally NP-hard. A naive approach that works for small problem instances is exhaustive search, that is, enumeration of all possible labelings of the underlying graph. We propose a general minimization approach for large graphs based on enumeration of labelings of certain small patches. This partial enumeration technique reduces complex high-order energy formulations to pairwise Constraint Satisfaction Problems with unary costs (uCSP), which can be efficiently solved using standard methods like TRW-S. Our approach outperforms a number of existing state-of-the-art algorithms on well known difficult problems (e.g. curvature regularization, stereo, deconvolution); it gives near global minimum and better speed.   Our main application of interest is curvature regularization. In the context of segmentation, our partial enumeration technique allows to evaluate curvature directly on small patches using a novel integral geometry approach.

- **Summary**: This paper is devoted to improve automatic emotion recognition from speech by incorporating rhythm and temporal features. Research on automatic emotion recognition so far has mostly been based on applying features like MFCCs, pitch and energy or intensity. The idea focuses on borrowing rhythm features from linguistic and phonetic analysis and applying them to the speech signal on the basis of acoustic knowledge only. In addition to this we exploit a set of temporal and loudness features. A segmentation unit is employed in starting to separate the voiced/unvoiced and silence parts and features are explored on different segments. Thereafter different classifiers are used for classification. After selecting the top features using an IGR filter we are able to achieve a recognition rate of 80.60 % on the Berlin Emotion Database for the speaker dependent framework.

- **Summary**: Watersheds have been defined both for node and edge weighted graphs. We show that they are identical: for each edge (resp.\ node) weighted graph exists a node (resp. edge) weighted graph with the same minima and catchment basin.

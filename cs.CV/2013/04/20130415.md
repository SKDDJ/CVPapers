- **Summary**: The availability of large volumes of remote sensing data insists on higher degree of automation in feature extraction, making it a need of the hour.The huge quantum of data that needs to be processed entails accelerated processing to be enabled.GPUs, which were originally designed to provide efficient visualization, are being massively employed for computation intensive parallel processing environments. Image processing in general and hence automated feature extraction, is highly computation intensive, where performance improvements have a direct impact on societal needs. In this context, an algorithm has been formulated for automated feature extraction from a panchromatic or multispectral image based on image processing techniques. Two Laplacian of Guassian (LoG) masks were applied on the image individually followed by detection of zero crossing points and extracting the pixels based on their standard deviation with the surrounding pixels. The two extracted images with different LoG masks were combined together which resulted in an image with the extracted features and edges. Finally the user is at liberty to apply the image smoothing step depending on the noise content in the extracted image. The image is passed through a hybrid median filter to remove the salt and pepper noise from the image. This paper discusses the aforesaid algorithm for automated feature extraction, necessity of deployment of GPUs for the same; system-level challenges and quantifies the benefits of integrating GPUs in such environment. The results demonstrate that substantial enhancement in performance margin can be achieved with the best utilization of GPU resources and an efficient parallelization strategy. Performance results in comparison with the conventional computing scenario have provided a speedup of 20x, on realization of this parallelizing strategy.

- **Summary**: Accurate detection of mitosis plays a critical role in breast cancer histopathology. Manual detection and counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and intra-reader variations. Multispectral imaging is a recent medical imaging technology, proven successful in increasing the segmentation accuracy in other fields. This study aims at improving the accuracy of mitosis detection by developing a specific solution using multispectral and multifocal imaging of breast cancer histopathological data. We propose to enable clinical routine-compliant quality of mitosis discrimination from other objects. The proposed framework includes comprehensive analysis of spectral bands and z-stack focus planes, detection of expected mitotic regions (candidates) in selected focus planes and spectral bands, computation of multispectral spatial features for each candidate, selection of multispectral spatial features and a study of different state-of-the-art classification methods for candidates classification as mitotic or non mitotic figures. This framework has been evaluated on MITOS multispectral medical dataset and achieved 60% detection rate and 57% F-Measure. Our results indicate that multispectral spatial features have more information for mitosis classification in comparison with white spectral band features, being therefore a very promising exploration area to improve the quality of the diagnosis assistance in histopathology.

- **Summary**: Classification of satellite images is a key component of many remote sensing applications. One of the most important products of a raw satellite image is the classified map which labels the image pixels into meaningful classes. Though several parametric and non-parametric classifiers have been developed thus far, accurate labeling of the pixels still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new reliable multiclass-classifier for identifying class labels of a satellite image in remote sensing applications. The proposed multiclass-classifier is a generalization of a binary classifier based on the flexible ensemble of regression trees model called Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). We used three small areas from the LANDSAT 5 TM image, acquired on August 15, 2009 (path/row: 08/29, L1T product, UTM map projection) over Kings County, Nova Scotia, Canada to classify the land-use. Several prediction accuracy and uncertainty measures have been used to compare the reliability of the proposed classifier with the state-of-the-art classifiers in remote sensing.

- **Summary**: Recovering shadows is an important step for many vision algorithms. Current approaches that work with time-lapse sequences are limited to simple thresholding heuristics. We show these approaches only work with very careful tuning of parameters, and do not work well for long-term time-lapse sequences taken over the span of many months. We introduce a parameter-free expectation maximization approach which simultaneously estimates shadows, albedo, surface normals, and skylight. This approach is more accurate than previous methods, works over both very short and very long sequences, and is robust to the effects of nonlinear camera response. Finally, we demonstrate that the shadow masks derived through this algorithm substantially improve the performance of sun-based photometric stereo compared to earlier shadow mask estimation.

- **Summary**: The field of Numismatics provides the names and descriptions of the symbols minted on the ancient coins. Classification of the ancient coins aims at assigning a given coin to its issuer. Various issuers used various symbols for their coins. We propose to use these symbols for a framework that will coarsely classify the ancient coins. Bag of visual words (BoVWs) is a well established visual recognition technique applied to various problems in computer vision like object and scene recognition. Improvements have been made by incorporating the spatial information to this technique. We apply the BoVWs technique to our problem and use three symbols for coarse-grained classification. We use rectangular tiling, log-polar tiling and circular tiling to incorporate spatial information to BoVWs. Experimental results show that the circular tiling proves superior to the rest of the methods for our problem.

- **Summary**: Crowd monitoring and analysis in mass events are highly important technologies to support the security of attending persons. Proposed methods based on terrestrial or airborne image/video data often fail in achieving sufficiently accurate results to guarantee a robust service. We present a novel framework for estimating human count, density and motion from video data based on custom tailored object detection techniques, a regression based density estimate and a total variation based optical flow extraction. From the gathered features we present a detailed accuracy analysis versus ground truth measurements. In addition, all information is projected into world coordinates to enable a direct integration with existing geo-information systems. The resulting human counts demonstrate a mean error of 4% to 9% and thus represent a most efficient measure that can be robustly applied in security critical services.

- **Summary**: Parsing human poses in images is fundamental in extracting critical visual information for artificial intelligent agents. Our goal is to learn self-contained body part representations from images, which we call visual symbols, and their symbol-wise geometric contexts in this parsing process. Each symbol is individually learned by categorizing visual features leveraged by geometric information. In the categorization, we use Latent Support Vector Machine followed by an efficient cross validation procedure to learn visual symbols. Then, these symbols naturally define geometric contexts of body parts in a fine granularity. When the structure of the compositional parts is a tree, we derive an efficient approach to estimating human poses in images. Experiments on two large datasets suggest our approach outperforms state of the art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel method which combines both median filter and simple standard deviation to accomplish an excellent edge detector for image processing. First of all, a denoising process must be applied on the grey scale image using median filter to identify pixels which are likely to be contaminated by noise. The benefit of this step is to smooth the image and get rid of the noisy pixels. After that, the simple statistical standard deviation could be computed for each 2X2 window size. If the value of the standard deviation inside the 2X2 window size is greater than a predefined threshold, then the upper left pixel in the 2?2 window represents an edge. The visual differences between the proposed edge detector and the standard known edge detectors have been shown to support the contribution in this paper.

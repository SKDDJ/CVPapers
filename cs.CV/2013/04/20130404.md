- **Summary**: This paper presents a survey and a comparative evaluation of recent techniques for moving cast shadow detection. We identify shadow removal as a critical step for improving object detection and tracking. The survey covers methods published during the last decade, and places them in a feature-based taxonomy comprised of four categories: chromacity, physical, geometry and textures. A selection of prominent methods across the categories is compared in terms of quantitative performance measures (shadow detection and discrimination rates, colour desaturation) as well as qualitative observations. Furthermore, we propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for determining the practical usefulness of shadow detection methods. The evaluation indicates that all shadow detection approaches make different contributions and all have individual strength and weaknesses. Out of the selected methods, the geometry-based technique has strict assumptions and is not generalisable to various environments, but it is a straightforward choice when the objects of interest are easy to model and their shadows have different orientation. The chromacity based method is the fastest to implement and run, but it is sensitive to noise and less effective in low saturated scenes. The physical method improves upon the accuracy of the chromacity method by adapting to local shadow models, but fails when the spectral properties of the objects are similar to that of the background. The small-region texture based method is especially robust for pixels whose neighbourhood is textured, but may take longer to implement and is the most computationally expensive. The large-region texture based method produces the most accurate results, but has a significant computational load due to its multiple processing steps.

- **Summary**: Minimization of the $L_\infty$ norm, which can be viewed as approximately solving the non-convex least median estimation problem, is a powerful method for outlier removal and hence robust regression. However, current techniques for solving the problem at the heart of $L_\infty$ norm minimization are slow, and therefore cannot scale to large problems. A new method for the minimization of the $L_\infty$ norm is presented here, which provides a speedup of multiple orders of magnitude for data with high dimension. This method, termed Fast $L_\infty$ Minimization, allows robust regression to be applied to a class of problems which were previously inaccessible. It is shown how the $L_\infty$ norm minimization problem can be broken up into smaller sub-problems, which can then be solved extremely efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the radical reduction in computation time, along with robustness against large numbers of outliers in a few model-fitting problems.

- **Summary**: The Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) clinical pathology test is commonly used to identify the existence of various diseases. A hallmark method for identifying the presence of ANAs is the Indirect Immunofluorescence method on Human Epithelial (HEp-2) cells, due to its high sensitivity and the large range of antigens that can be detected. However, the method suffers from numerous shortcomings, such as being subjective as well as time and labour intensive. Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems have been developed to address these problems, which automatically classify a HEp-2 cell image into one of its known patterns (eg., speckled, homogeneous). Most of the existing CAD systems use handpicked features to represent a HEp-2 cell image, which may only work in limited scenarios. In this paper, we propose a cell classification system comprised of a dual-region codebook-based descriptor, combined with the Nearest Convex Hull Classifier. We evaluate the performance of several variants of the descriptor on two publicly available datasets: ICPR HEp-2 cell classification contest dataset and the new SNPHEp-2 dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first time codebook-based descriptors are applied and studied in this domain. Experiments show that the proposed system has consistent high performance and is more robust than two recent CAD systems.

- **Summary**: This article studies the problem of image restoration of observed images corrupted by impulse noise and mixed Gaussian impulse noise. Since the pixels damaged by impulse noise contain no information about the true image, how to find this set correctly is a very important problem. We propose two methods based on blind inpainting and $\ell_0$ minimization that can simultaneously find the damaged pixels and restore the image. By iteratively restoring the image and updating the set of damaged pixels, these methods have better performance than other methods, as shown in the experiments. In addition, we provide convergence analysis for these methods, these algorithms will converge to coordinatewise minimum points. In addition, they will converge to local minimum points (or with probability one) with some modifications in the algorithms.

- **Summary**: Barten's model of spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function of human visual system is embedded in a multi-slice channelized Hotelling observer. This is done by 3D filtering of the stack of images with the spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function and feeding the result (i.e., the perceived image stack) to the multi-slice channelized Hotelling observer. The proposed procedure of considering spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function is generic in the sense that it can be used with observers other than multi-slice channelized Hotelling observer. Detection performance of the new observer in digital breast tomosynthesis is measured in a variety of browsing speeds, at two spatial sampling rates, using computer simulations. Our results show a peak in detection performance in mid browsing speeds. We compare our results to those of a human observer study reported earlier (I. Diaz et al. SPIE MI 2011). The effects of display luminance, contrast and spatial sampling rate, with and without considering foveal vision, are also studied. Reported simulations are conducted with real digital breast tomosynthesis image stacks, as well as stacks from an anthropomorphic software breast phantom (P. Bakic et al. Med Phys. 2011). Lesion cases are simulated by inserting single micro-calcifications or masses. Limitations of our methods and ways to improve them are discussed.

- **Summary**: This work proposes the combination of multiscale transform with fractal descriptors employed in the classification of gray-level texture images. We apply the space-scale transform (derivative + Gaussian filter) over the Bouligand-Minkowski fractal descriptors, followed by a threshold over the filter response, aiming at attenuating noise effects caused by the final part of this response. The method is tested in the classification of a well-known data set (Brodatz) and compared with other classical texture descriptor techniques. The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach, achieving a higher success rate with a reduced amount of descriptors.

- **Summary**: This paper is to create a practical steganographic implementation to hide color image (stego) inside another color image (cover). The proposed technique uses Five Modulus Method to convert the whole pixels within both the cover and the stego images into multiples of five. Since each pixels inside the stego image is divisible by five then the whole stego image could be divided by five to get new range of pixels 0..51. Basically, the reminder of each number that is not divisible by five is either 1,2,3 or 4 when divided by 5. Subsequently, then a 4-by-4 window size has been implemented to accommodate the proposed technique. For each 4-by-4 window inside the cover image, a number from 1 to 4 could be embedded secretly from the stego image. The previous discussion must be applied separately for each of the R, G, and B arrays. Moreover, a stego-key could be combined with the proposed algorithm to make it difficult for any adversary to extract the secret image from the cover image. Based on the PSNR value, the extracted stego image has high PSNR value. Hence this new steganography algorithm is very efficient to hide color images.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider the approximate weighted graph matching problem and introduce stable and informative first and second order compatibility terms suitable for inclusion into the popular integer quadratic program formulation. Our approach relies on a rigorous analysis of stability of spectral signatures based on the graph Laplacian. In the case of the first order term, we derive an objective function that measures both the stability and informativeness of a given spectral signature. By optimizing this objective, we design new spectral node signatures tuned to a specific graph to be matched. We also introduce the pairwise heat kernel distance as a stable second order compatibility term; we justify its plausibility by showing that in a certain limiting case it converges to the classical adjacency matrix-based second order compatibility function. We have tested our approach on a set of synthetic graphs, the widely-used CMU house sequence, and a set of real images. These experiments show the superior performance of our first and second order compatibility terms as compared with the commonly used ones.

- **Summary**: Solar storms can have a major impact on the infrastructure of the earth. Some of the causing events are observable from ground in the H{\alpha} spectral line. In this paper we propose a new method for the simultaneous detection of flares and filaments in H{\alpha} image sequences. Therefore we perform several preprocessing steps to enhance and normalize the images. Based on the intensity values we segment the image by a variational approach. In a final postprecessing step we derive essential properties to classify the events and further demonstrate the performance by comparing our obtained results to the data annotated by an expert. The information produced by our method can be used for near real-time alerts and the statistical analysis of existing data by solar physicists.

- **Summary**: We present a pulmonary vessel segmentation algorithm, which is fast, fully automatic and robust. It uses a coarse segmentation of the airway tree and a left and right lung labeled volume to restrict a vessel enhancement filter, based on an offset medialness function, to the lungs. We show the application of our algorithm on contrast-enhanced CT images, where we derive a clinical parameter to detect pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients. Results on a dataset of 24 patients show that quantitative indices derived from the segmentation are applicable to distinguish patients with and without PH. Further work-in-progress results are shown on the VESSEL12 challenge dataset, which is composed of non-contrast-enhanced scans, where we range in the midfield of participating contestants.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a global convex approach for image hallucination. Altering the idea of classical multi image super resolution (SU) systems to single image SU, we incorporate aligned images to hallucinate the output. Our work is based on the paper of Tappen et al. where they use a non-convex model for image hallucination. In comparison we formulate a convex primal optimization problem and derive a fast converging primal-dual algorithm with a global optimal solution. We use a database with face images to incorporate high-frequency details to the high-resolution output. We show that we can achieve state-of-the-art results by using a convex approach.

- **Summary**: Standard OCR is a well-researched topic of computer vision and can be considered solved for machine-printed text. However, when applied to unconstrained images, the recognition rates drop drastically. Therefore, the employment of object recognition-based techniques has become state of the art in scene text recognition applications. This paper presents a scene text recognition method tailored to ancient coin legends and compares the results achieved in character and word recognition experiments to a standard OCR engine. The conducted experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the standard OCR engine on a set of 180 cropped coin legend words.

- **Summary**: We investigate possibilities to speed up iterative algorithms for non-blind image deconvolution. We focus on algorithms in which convolution with the point-spread function to be deconvolved is used in each iteration, and aim at accelerating these convolution operations as they are typically the most expensive part of the computation. We follow two approaches: First, for some practically important specific point-spread functions, algorithmically efficient sliding window or list processing techniques can be used. In some constellations this allows faster computation than via the Fourier domain. Second, as iterations progress, computation of convolutions can be restricted to subsets of pixels. For moderate thinning rates this can be done with almost no impact on the reconstruction quality. Both approaches are demonstrated in the context of Richardson-Lucy deconvolution but are not restricted to this method.

- **Summary**: We introduce and we analyze a new dataset which resembles the input to biological vision systems much more than most previously published ones. Our analysis leaded to several important conclusions. First, it is possible to disambiguate over dozens of visual scenes (locations) encountered over the course of several weeks of a human life with accuracy of over 80%, and this opens up possibility for numerous novel vision applications, from early detection of dementia to everyday use of wearable camera streams for automatic reminders, and visual stream exchange. Second, our experimental results indicate that, generative models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation or Counting Grids, are more suitable to such types of data, as they are more robust to overtraining and comfortable with images at low resolution, blurred and characterized by relatively random clutter and a mix of objects.

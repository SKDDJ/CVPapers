- **Summary**: Some software solutions used to obtain the facial transformations can help investigating the artistic metamorphosis of the ancient portraits of the same person. An analysis with a freely available software of portraitures of Julius Caesar is proposed, showing his several "morphs". The software helps enhancing the mood the artist added to a portrait.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval has been a top topic in the field of both computer vision and machine learning for a long time. Content based image retrieval, which tries to retrieve images from a database visually similar to a query image, has attracted much attention. Two most important issues of image retrieval are the representation and ranking of the images. Recently, bag-of-words based method has shown its power as a representation method. Moreover, nonnegative matrix factorization is also a popular way to represent the data samples. In addition, contextual similarity learning has also been studied and proven to be an effective method for the ranking problem. However, these technologies have never been used together. In this paper, we developed an effective image retrieval system by representing each image using the bag-of-words method as histograms, and then apply the nonnegative matrix factorization to factorize the histograms, and finally learn the ranking score using the contextual similarity learning method. The proposed novel system is evaluated on a large scale image database and the effectiveness is shown.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recurrent iterated function systems (RIFSs) are improvements of iterated function systems (IFSs) using elements of the theory of Marcovian stochastic processes which can produce more natural looking images. We construct new RIFSs consisting substantially of a vertical contraction factor function and nonlinear transformations. These RIFSs are applied to image compression.

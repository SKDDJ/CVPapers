- **Summary**: A C# implementation of a generalized k-means variant called relational k-means is described here. Relational k-means is a generalization of the well-known k-means clustering method which works for non-Euclidean scenarios as well. The input is an arbitrary distance matrix, as opposed to the traditional k-means method, where the clustered objects need to be identified with vectors.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the automatic recognition of handwritten temperature values in weather records. The localization of table cells is based on line detection using projection profiles. Further, a stroke-preserving line removal method which is based on gradient images is proposed. The presented digit recognition utilizes features which are extracted using a set of filters and a Support Vector Machine classifier. It was evaluated on the MNIST and the USPS dataset and our own database with about 17,000 RGB digit images. An accuracy of 99.36% per digit is achieved for the entire system using a set of 84 weather records.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an algebraic approach to upgrade a projective reconstruction to a Euclidean one, and aim at computing the rectifying homography from a minimal number of 9 segments of known length. Constraints are derived from these segments which yield a set of polynomial equations that we solve by means of Gr\"obner bases. We explain how a solver for such a system of equations can be constructed from simplified template data. Moreover, we present experiments that demonstrate that the given problem can be solved in this way.

- **Summary**: The examination of Osteoarthritis disease through X-ray by rheumatology can be classified into four grade of severity. This paper discusses about the application of artificial neural network backpropagation method for measuring the severity of the disease, where the observed X-ray range from wrist to fingers. The main procedures of system in this paper is divided into three, which are image processing, feature extraction, and artificial neural network process. First, an X-ray image digital (200x150 pixels and greyscale) will be thresholded, then extracted features based on probabilistic values of the color intensity of seven bit quantization result, and statistical textures. That feature values then will be normalizing to interval [0.1, 0.9], and then the result would be processing on backpropagation artificial neural network system as input to determine the severity of disease from an X-ray had input before it. From testing with learning rate 0.3, momentum 0.4, hidden units five pieces and about 132 feature vectors, this system had had a level of accuracy of 100% for learning data, 80% for learning and non-learning data, and 66.6% for non-learning data

- **Summary**: The effects of global climate change on Peruvian glaciers have brought about several processes of deglaciation during the last few years. The immediate effect is the change of size of lakes and rivers. Public institutions that monitor water resources currently have only recent studies which make up less than 10% of the total. The effects of climate change and the lack of updated information intensify social-economic problems related to water resources in Peru. The objective of this research is to develop a software application to automate the Cadastral Registry of Water Bodies in Peru, using techniques of digital image processing, which would provide tools for detection, record, temporal analysis and visualization of water bodies. The images used are from the satellite Landsat5, which undergo a pre-processing of calibration and correction of the satellite. Detection results are archived into a file that contains location vectors and images of the segmentated bodies of water.

- **Summary**: Image fusion is one of the recent trends in image registration which is an essential field of image processing. The basic principle of this paper is to fuse multi-focus images using simple statistical standard deviation. Firstly, the simple standard deviation for the k-by-k window inside each of the multi-focus images was computed. The contribution in this paper came from the idea that the focused part inside an image had high details rather than the unfocused part. Hence, the dispersion between pixels inside the focused part is higher than the dispersion inside the unfocused part. Secondly, a simple comparison between the standard deviation for each k-by-k window in the multi-focus images could be computed. The highest standard deviation between all the computed standard deviations for the multi-focus images could be treated as the optimal that is to be placed in the fused image. The experimental visual results show that the proposed method produces very satisfactory results in spite of its simplicity.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new rotationally invariant viewing angle classification method for identifying, among a large number of Cryo-EM projection images, similar views without prior knowledge of the molecule. Our rotationally invariant features are based on the bispectrum. Each image is denoised and compressed using steerable principal component analysis (PCA) such that rotating an image is equivalent to phase shifting the expansion coefficients. Thus we are able to extend the theory of bispectrum of 1D periodic signals to 2D images. The randomized PCA algorithm is then used to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of the bispectrum coefficients, enabling fast computation of the similarity between any pair of images. The nearest neighbors provide an initial classification of similar viewing angles. In this way, rotational alignment is only performed for images with their nearest neighbors. The initial nearest neighbor classification and alignment are further improved by a new classification method called vector diffusion maps. Our pipeline for viewing angle classification and alignment is experimentally shown to be faster and more accurate than reference-free alignment with rotationally invariant K-means clustering, MSA/MRA 2D classification, and their modern approximations.

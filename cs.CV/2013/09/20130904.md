- **Summary**: Tomographic reconstruction of a binary image from few projections is considered. A novel {\em heuristic} algorithm is proposed, the central element of which is a nonlinear transformation $\psi(p)=\log(p/(1-p))$ of the probability $p$ that a pixel of the sought image be 1-valued. It consists of backprojections based on $\psi(p)$ and iterative corrections. Application of this algorithm to a series of artificial test cases leads to exact binary reconstructions, (i.e recovery of the binary image for each single pixel) from the knowledge of projection data over a few directions. Images up to $10^6$ pixels are reconstructed in a few seconds. A series of test cases is performed for comparison with previous methods, showing a better efficiency and reduced computation times.

- **Summary**: This paper describes an efficient approach for human face recognition based on blood perfusion data from infra-red face images. Blood perfusion data are characterized by the regional blood flow in human tissue and therefore do not depend entirely on surrounding temperature. These data bear a great potential for deriving discriminating facial thermogram for better classification and recognition of face images in comparison to optical image data. Blood perfusion data are related to distribution of blood vessels under the face skin. A distribution of blood vessels are unique for each person and as a set of extracted minutiae points from a blood perfusion data of a human face should be unique for that face. There may be several such minutiae point sets for a single face but all of these correspond to that particular face only. Entire face image is partitioned into equal blocks and the total number of minutiae points from each block is computed to construct final vector. Therefore, the size of the feature vectors is found to be same as total number of blocks considered. For classification, a five layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network has been used. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed face recognition system with varying block sizes. Experiments have been performed on the database created at our own laboratory. The maximum success of 91.47% recognition has been achieved with block size 8X8.

- **Summary**: In this paper an efficient approach for human face recognition based on the use of minutiae points in thermal face image is proposed. The thermogram of human face is captured by thermal infra-red camera. Image processing methods are used to pre-process the captured thermogram, from which different physiological features based on blood perfusion data are extracted. Blood perfusion data are related to distribution of blood vessels under the face skin. In the present work, three different methods have been used to get the blood perfusion image, namely bit-plane slicing and medial axis transform, morphological erosion and medial axis transform, sobel edge operators. Distribution of blood vessels is unique for each person and a set of extracted minutiae points from a blood perfusion data of a human face should be unique for that face. Two different methods are discussed for extracting minutiae points from blood perfusion data. For extraction of features entire face image is partitioned into equal size blocks and the total number of minutiae points from each block is computed to construct final feature vector. Therefore, the size of the feature vectors is found to be same as total number of blocks considered. A five layer feed-forward back propagation neural network is used as the classification tool. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed face recognition methodologies with varying block size on the database created at our own laboratory. It has been found that the first method supercedes the other two producing an accuracy of 97.62% with block size 16X16 for bit-plane 4.

- **Summary**: Thermal infra-red (IR) images focus on changes of temperature distribution on facial muscles and blood vessels. These temperature changes can be regarded as texture features of images. A comparative study of face recognition methods working in thermal spectrum is carried out in this paper. In these study two local-matching methods based on Haar wavelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) are analyzed. Wavelet transform is a good tool to analyze multi-scale, multi-direction changes of texture. Local binary patterns (LBP) are a type of feature used for classification in computer vision. Firstly, human thermal IR face image is preprocessed and cropped the face region only from the entire image. Secondly, two different approaches are used to extract the features from the cropped face region. In the first approach, the training images and the test images are processed with Haar wavelet transform and the LL band and the average of LH/HL/HH bands sub-images are created for each face image. Then a total confidence matrix is formed for each face image by taking a weighted sum of the corresponding pixel values of the LL band and average band. For LBP feature extraction, each of the face images in training and test datasets is divided into 161 numbers of sub images, each of size 8X8 pixels. For each such sub images, LBP features are extracted which are concatenated in row wise manner. PCA is performed separately on the individual feature set for dimensionality reeducation. Finally two different classifiers are used to classify face images. One such classifier multi-layer feed forward neural network and another classifier is minimum distance classifier. The Experiments have been performed on the database created at our own laboratory and Terravic Facial IR Database.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a thermal infra red face recognition system for human identification and verification using blood perfusion data and back propagation feed forward neural network is proposed. The system consists of three steps. At the very first step face region is cropped from the colour 24-bit input images. Secondly face features are extracted from the croped region, which will be taken as the input of the back propagation feed forward neural network in the third step and classification and recognition is carried out. The proposed approaches are tested on a number of human thermal infra red face images created at our own laboratory. Experimental results reveal the higher degree performance

- **Summary**: Thermal infrared (IR) images represent the heat patterns emitted from hot object and they do not consider the energies reflected from an object. Objects living or non-living emit different amounts of IR energy according to their body temperature and characteristics. Humans are homoeothermic and hence capable of maintaining constant temperature under different surrounding temperature. Face recognition from thermal (IR) images should focus on changes of temperature on facial blood vessels. These temperature changes can be regarded as texture features of images and wavelet transform is a very good tool to analyze multi-scale and multi-directional texture. Wavelet transform is also used for image dimensionality reduction, by removing redundancies and preserving original features of the image. The sizes of the facial images are normally large. So, the wavelet transform is used before image similarity is measured. Therefore this paper describes an efficient approach of human face recognition based on wavelet transform from thermal IR images. The system consists of three steps. At the very first step, human thermal IR face image is preprocessed and the face region is only cropped from the entire image. Secondly, Haar wavelet is used to extract low frequency band from the cropped face region. Lastly, the image classification between the training images and the test images is done, which is based on low-frequency components. The proposed approach is tested on a number of human thermal infrared face images created at our own laboratory and Terravic Facial IR Database. Experimental results indicated that the thermal infra red face images can be recognized by the proposed system effectively. The maximum success of 95% recognition has been achieved.

- **Summary**: The goal of object detection is to find objects in an image. An object detector accepts an image and produces a list of locations as $(x,y)$ pairs. Here we introduce a new concept: {\bf location-based boosting}. Location-based boosting differs from previous boosting algorithms because it optimizes a new spatial loss function to combine object detectors, each of which may have marginal performance, into a single, more accurate object detector. A structured representation of object locations as a list of $(x,y)$ pairs is a more natural domain for object detection than the spatially unstructured representation produced by classifiers. Furthermore, this formulation allows us to take advantage of the intuition that large areas of the background are uninteresting and it is not worth expending computational effort on them. This results in a more scalable algorithm because it does not need to take measures to prevent the background data from swamping the foreground data such as subsampling or applying an ad-hoc weighting to the pixels. We first present the theory of location-based boosting, and then motivate it with empirical results on a challenging data set.

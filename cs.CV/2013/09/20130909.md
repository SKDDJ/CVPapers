- **Summary**: Recently single image super resolution is very important research area to generate high resolution image from given low resolution image. Algorithms of single image resolution are mainly based on wavelet domain and spatial domain. Filters support to model the regularity of natural images is exploited in wavelet domain while edges of images get sharp during up sampling in spatial domain. Here single image super resolution algorithm is presented which based on both spatial and wavelet domain and take the advantage of both. Algorithm is iterative and use back projection to minimize reconstruction error. Wavelet based denoising method is also introduced to remove noise.

- **Summary**: A low-rank transformation learning framework for subspace clustering and classification is here proposed. Many high-dimensional data, such as face images and motion sequences, approximately lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The corresponding subspace clustering problem has been extensively studied in the literature to partition such high-dimensional data into clusters corresponding to their underlying low-dimensional subspaces. However, low-dimensional intrinsic structures are often violated for real-world observations, as they can be corrupted by errors or deviate from ideal models. We propose to address this by learning a linear transformation on subspaces using matrix rank, via its convex surrogate nuclear norm, as the optimization criteria. The learned linear transformation restores a low-rank structure for data from the same subspace, and, at the same time, forces a a maximally separated structure for data from different subspaces. In this way, we reduce variations within subspaces, and increase separation between subspaces for a more robust subspace clustering. This proposed learned robust subspace clustering framework significantly enhances the performance of existing subspace clustering methods. Basic theoretical results here presented help to further support the underlying framework. To exploit the low-rank structures of the transformed subspaces, we further introduce a fast subspace clustering technique, which efficiently combines robust PCA with sparse modeling. When class labels are present at the training stage, we show this low-rank transformation framework also significantly enhances classification performance. Extensive experiments using public datasets are presented, showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for subspace clustering and classification.

- **Summary**: New and more natural human-robot interfaces are of crucial interest to the evolution of robotics. This paper addresses continuous and real-time hand gesture spotting, i.e., gesture segmentation plus gesture recognition. Gesture patterns are recognized by using artificial neural networks (ANNs) specifically adapted to the process of controlling an industrial robot. Since in continuous gesture recognition the communicative gestures appear intermittently with the noncommunicative, we are proposing a new architecture with two ANNs in series to recognize both kinds of gesture. A data glove is used as interface technology. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed solution presents high recognition rates (over 99% for a library of ten gestures and over 96% for a library of thirty gestures), low training and learning time and a good capacity to generalize from particular situations.

- **Summary**: The linearized Bregman method is a method to calculate sparse solutions to systems of linear equations. We formulate this problem as a split feasibility problem, propose an algorithmic framework based on Bregman projections and prove a general convergence result for this framework. Convergence of the linearized Bregman method will be obtained as a special case. Our approach also allows for several generalizations such as other objective functions, incremental iterations, incorporation of non-gaussian noise models or box constraints.

- **Summary**: Describing shapes by suitable measures in object segmentation, as proposed in [24], allows to combine the advantages of the representations as parametrized contours and indicator functions. The pseudo-Riemannian structure of optimal transport can be used to model shapes in ways similar as with contours, while the Kantorovich functional enables the application of convex optimization methods for global optimality of the segmentation functional.   In this paper we provide a mathematical study of the shape measure representation and its relation to the contour description. In particular we show that the pseudo-Riemannian structure of optimal transport, when restricted to the set of shape measures, yields a manifold which is diffeomorphic to the manifold of closed contours. A discussion of the metric induced by optimal transport and the corresponding geodesic equation is given.

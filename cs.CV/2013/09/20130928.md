- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new approach for face verification, where a pair of images needs to be classified as belonging to the same person or not. This problem is relatively new and not well-explored in the literature. Current methods mostly adopt techniques borrowed from face recognition, and process each of the images in the pair independently, which is counter intuitive. In contrast, we propose to extract cross-image features, i.e. features across the pair of images, which, as we demonstrate, is more discriminative to the similarity and the dissimilarity of faces. Our features are derived from the popular Haar-like features, however, extended to handle the face verification problem instead of face detection. We collect a large bank of cross-image features using filters of different sizes, locations, and orientations. Consequently, we use AdaBoost to select and weight the most discriminative features. We carried out extensive experiments on the proposed ideas using three standard face verification datasets, and obtained promising results outperforming state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: In the past decade, SIFT descriptor has been witnessed as one of the most robust local invariant feature descriptors and widely used in various vision tasks. Most traditional image classification systems depend on the luminance-based SIFT descriptors, which only analyze the gray level variations of the images. Misclassification may happen since their color contents are ignored. In this article, we concentrate on improving the performance of existing image classification algorithms by adding color information. To achieve this purpose, different kinds of colored SIFT descriptors are introduced and implemented. Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC), a state-of-the-art sparse coding technology, is employed to construct the image classification system for the evaluation. The real experiments are carried out on several benchmarks. With the enhancements of color SIFT, the proposed image classification system obtains approximate 3% improvement of classification accuracy on the Caltech-101 dataset and approximate 4% improvement of classification accuracy on the Caltech-256 dataset.

- **Summary**: Submodular functions can be exactly minimized in polynomial time, and the special case that graph cuts solve with max flow \cite{KZ:PAMI04} has had significant impact in computer vision \cite{BVZ:PAMI01,Kwatra:SIGGRAPH03,Rother:GrabCut04}. In this paper we address the important class of sum-of-submodular (SoS) functions \cite{Arora:ECCV12,Kolmogorov:DAM12}, which can be efficiently minimized via a variant of max flow called submodular flow \cite{Edmonds:ADM77}. SoS functions can naturally express higher order priors involving, e.g., local image patches; however, it is difficult to fully exploit their expressive power because they have so many parameters. Rather than trying to formulate existing higher order priors as an SoS function, we take a discriminative learning approach, effectively searching the space of SoS functions for a higher order prior that performs well on our training set. We adopt a structural SVM approach \cite{Joachims/etal/09a,Tsochantaridis/etal/04} and formulate the training problem in terms of quadratic programming; as a result we can efficiently search the space of SoS priors via an extended cutting-plane algorithm. We also show how the state-of-the-art max flow method for vision problems \cite{Goldberg:ESA11} can be modified to efficiently solve the submodular flow problem. Experimental comparisons are made against the OpenCV implementation of the GrabCut interactive segmentation technique \cite{Rother:GrabCut04}, which uses hand-tuned parameters instead of machine learning. On a standard dataset \cite{Gulshan:CVPR10} our method learns higher order priors with hundreds of parameter values, and produces significantly better segmentations. While our focus is on binary labeling problems, we show that our techniques can be naturally generalized to handle more than two labels.

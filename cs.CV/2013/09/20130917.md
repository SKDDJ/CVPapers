- **Summary**: A new image denoising algorithm to deal with the Poisson noise model is given, which is based on the idea of Non-Local Mean. By using the "Oracle" concept, we establish a theorem to show that the Non-Local Means Filter can effectively deal with Poisson noise with some modification. Under the theoretical result, we construct our new algorithm called Non-Local Means Poisson Filter and demonstrate in theory that the filter converges at the usual optimal rate. The filter is as simple as the classic Non-Local Means and the simulation results show that our filter is very competitive.

- **Summary**: The problem of Poisson denoising appears in various imaging applications, such as low-light photography, medical imaging and microscopy. In cases of high SNR, several transformations exist so as to convert the Poisson noise into an additive i.i.d. Gaussian noise, for which many effective algorithms are available. However, in a low SNR regime, these transformations are significantly less accurate, and a strategy that relies directly on the true noise statistics is required. A recent work by Salmon et al. took this route, proposing a patch-based exponential image representation model based on GMM (Gaussian mixture model), leading to state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we propose to harness sparse-representation modeling to the image patches, adopting the same exponential idea. Our scheme uses a greedy pursuit with boot-strapping based stopping condition and dictionary learning within the denoising process. The reconstruction performance of the proposed scheme is competitive with leading methods in high SNR, and achieving state-of-the-art results in cases of low SNR.

- **Summary**: We demonstrate a compressed sensing, photon counting lidar system based on the single-pixel camera. Our technique recovers both depth and intensity maps from a single under-sampled set of incoherent, linear projections of a scene of interest at ultra-low light levels around 0.5 picowatts. Only two-dimensional reconstructions are required to image a three-dimensional scene. We demonstrate intensity imaging and depth mapping at 256 x 256 pixel transverse resolution with acquisition times as short as 3 seconds. We also show novelty filtering, reconstructing only the difference between two instances of a scene. Finally, we acquire 32 x 32 pixel real-time video for three-dimensional object tracking at 14 frames-per-second.

- **Summary**: Analysis of microscopy images can provide insight into many biological processes. One particularly challenging problem is cell nuclear segmentation in highly anisotropic and noisy 3D image data. Manually localizing and segmenting each and every cell nuclei is very time consuming, which remains a bottleneck in large scale biological experiments. In this work we present a tool for automated segmentation of cell nuclei from 3D fluorescent microscopic data. Our tool is based on state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning techniques and supports a friendly graphical user interface (GUI). We show that our tool is as accurate as manual annotation but greatly reduces the time for the registration.

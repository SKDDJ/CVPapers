- **Summary**: This paper is based on an application of smoothing of 3D face images followed by feature detection i.e. detecting the nose tip. The present method uses a weighted mesh median filtering technique for smoothing. In this present smoothing technique we have built the neighborhood surrounding a particular point in 3D face and replaced that with the weighted value of the surrounding points in 3D face image. After applying the smoothing technique to the 3D face images our experimental results show that we have obtained considerable improvement as compared to the algorithm without smoothing. We have used here the maximum intensity algorithm for detecting the nose-tip and this method correctly detects the nose-tip in case of any pose i.e. along X, Y, and Z axes. The present technique gave us worked successfully on 535 out of 542 3D face images as compared to the method without smoothing which worked only on 521 3D face images out of 542 face images. Thus we have obtained a 98.70% performance rate over 96.12% performance rate of the algorithm without smoothing. All the experiments have been performed on the FRAV3D database.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new approach that takes as input a 3D face image across X, Y and Z axes as well as both Y and X axes and gives output as its pose i.e. it tells whether the face is oriented with respect the X, Y or Z axes or is it oriented across multiple axes with angles of rotation up to 42 degree. All the experiments have been performed on the FRAV3D, GAVADB and Bosphorus database which has two figures of each individual across multiple axes. After applying the proposed algorithm to the 3D facial surface from FRAV3D on 848 3D faces, 566 3D faces were correctly recognized for pose thus giving 67% of correct identification rate. We had experimented on 420 images from the GAVADB database, and only 336 images were detected for correct pose identification rate i.e. 80% and from Bosphorus database on 560 images only 448 images were detected for correct pose identification i.e. 80%.abstract goes here.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a novel method that combines a HK curvature-based approach for three-dimensional (3D) face detection in different poses (X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis). Salient face features, such as the eyes and nose, are detected through an analysis of the curvature of the entire facial surface. All the experiments have been performed on the FRAV3D Database. After applying the proposed algorithm to the 3D facial surface we have obtained considerably good results i.e. on 752 3D face images our method detected the eye corners for 543 face images, thus giving a 72.20% of eye corners detection and 743 face images for nose-tip detection thus giving a 98.80% of good nose tip localization

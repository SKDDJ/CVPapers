- **Summary**: In this paper we present a novel approach that takes as input a 3D image and gives as output its pose i.e. it tells whether the face is oriented with respect the X, Y or Z axes with angles of rotation up to 40 degree. All the experiments have been performed on the FRAV3D Database. After applying the proposed algorithm to the 3D facial surface we have obtained i.e. on 848 3D face images our method detected the pose correctly for 566 face images,thus giving an approximately 67 % of correct pose detection.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a novel technique of registering 3D images across pose. In this context, we have taken into account the images which are aligned across X, Y and Z axes. We have first determined the angle across which the image is rotated with respect to X, Y and Z axes and then translation is performed on the images. After testing the proposed method on 472 images from the FRAV3D database, the method correctly registers 358 images thus giving a performance rate of 75.84%.

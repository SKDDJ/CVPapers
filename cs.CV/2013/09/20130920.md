- **Summary**: We present an approach to searching large video corpora for video clips which depict a natural-language query in the form of a sentence. This approach uses compositional semantics to encode subtle meaning that is lost in other systems, such as the difference between two sentences which have identical words but entirely different meaning: "The person rode the horse} vs. \emph{The horse rode the person". Given a video-sentence pair and a natural-language parser, along with a grammar that describes the space of sentential queries, we produce a score which indicates how well the video depicts the sentence. We produce such a score for each video clip in a corpus and return a ranked list of clips. Furthermore, this approach addresses two fundamental problems simultaneously: detecting and tracking objects, and recognizing whether those tracks depict the query. Because both tracking and object detection are unreliable, this uses knowledge about the intended sentential query to focus the tracker on the relevant participants and ensures that the resulting tracks are described by the sentential query. While earlier work was limited to single-word queries which correspond to either verbs or nouns, we show how one can search for complex queries which contain multiple phrases, such as prepositional phrases, and modifiers, such as adverbs. We demonstrate this approach by searching for 141 queries involving people and horses interacting with each other in 10 full-length Hollywood movies.

- **Summary**: One of the central problems in computer vision is the detection of semantically important objects and the estimation of their pose. Most of the work in object detection has been based on single image processing and its performance is limited by occlusions and ambiguity in appearance and geometry. This paper proposes an active approach to object detection by controlling the point of view of a mobile depth camera. When an initial static detection phase identifies an object of interest, several hypotheses are made about its class and orientation. The sensor then plans a sequence of views, which balances the amount of energy used to move with the chance of identifying the correct hypothesis. We formulate an active hypothesis testing problem, which includes sensor mobility, and solve it using a point-based approximate POMDP algorithm. The validity of our approach is verified through simulation and real-world experiments with the PR2 robot. The results suggest that our approach outperforms the widely-used greedy view point selection and provides a significant improvement over static object detection.

- **Summary**: Compressed Sensing based Terahertz imaging (CS-THz) is a computational imaging technique. It uses only one THz receiver to accumulate the random modulated image measurements where the original THz image is reconstruct from these measurements using compressed sensing solvers. The advantage of the CS-THz is its reduced acquisition time compared with the raster scan mode. However, when it applied to large-scale two-dimensional (2D) imaging, the increased dimension resulted in both high computational complexity and excessive memory usage. In this paper, we introduced a novel CS-based THz imaging system that progressively compressed the THz image column by column. Therefore, the CS-THz system could be simplified with a much smaller sized modulator and reduced dimension. In order to utilize the block structure and the correlation of adjacent columns of the THz image, a complex-valued block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm was proposed. We conducted systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art CS algorithms under the scan based CS-THz architecture. The compression ratios and the choices of the sensing matrices were analyzed in detail using both synthetic and real-life THz images. Simulation results showed that both the scan based architecture and the proposed recovery algorithm were superior and efficient for large scale CS-THz applications.

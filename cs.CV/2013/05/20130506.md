- **Summary**: The study of human factors in the frame of interaction studies has been relevant for usability engi-neering and ergonomics for decades. Today, with the advent of wearable eye-tracking and Google glasses, monitoring of human factors will soon become ubiquitous. This work describes a computer vision system that enables pervasive mapping and monitoring of human attention. The key contribu-tion is that our methodology enables full 3D recovery of the gaze pointer, human view frustum and associated human centred measurements directly into an automatically computed 3D model in real-time. We apply RGB-D SLAM and descriptor matching methodologies for the 3D modelling, locali-zation and fully automated annotation of ROIs (regions of interest) within the acquired 3D model. This innovative methodology will open new avenues for attention studies in real world environments, bringing new potential into automated processing for human factors technologies.

- **Summary**: The potential of compressive sensing (CS) has spurred great interest in the research community and is a fast growing area of research. However, research translating CS theory into practical hardware and demonstrating clear and significant benefits with this hardware over current, conventional imaging techniques has been limited. This article helps researchers to find those niche applications where the CS approach provides substantial gain over conventional approaches by articulating lessons learned in finding one such application; sea skimming missile detection. As a proof of concept, it is demonstrated that a simplified CS missile detection architecture and algorithm provides comparable results to the conventional imaging approach but using a smaller FPA. The primary message is that all of the excitement surrounding CS is necessary and appropriate for encouraging our creativity but we all must also take off our "rose colored glasses" and critically judge our ideas, methods and results relative to conventional imaging approaches.

- **Summary**: We present a novel segmentation algorithm based on a hierarchical representation of images. The main contribution of this work is to explore the capabilities of the A Contrario reasoning when applied to the segmentation problem, and to overcome the limitations of current algorithms within that framework. This exploratory approach has three main goals.   Our first goal is to extend the search space of greedy merging algorithms to the set of all partitions spanned by a certain hierarchy, and to cast the segmentation as a selection problem within this space. In this way we increase the number of tested partitions and thus we potentially improve the segmentation results. In addition, this space is considerably smaller than the space of all possible partitions, thus we still keep the complexity controlled.   Our second goal aims to improve the locality of region merging algorithms, which usually merge pairs of neighboring regions. In this work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a validation procedure for complete partitions, rather than for pairs of regions.   The third goal is to perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation methodology in order to provide reproducible results.   Finally, we embed the selection process on a statistical A Contrario framework which allows us to have only one free parameter related to the desired scale.



### A Convex Functional for Image Denoising based on Patches with Constrained Overlaps and its vectorial application to Low Dose Differential Phase Tomography

- **Summary**: We solve the image denoising problem with a dictionary learning technique by writing a convex functional of a new form. This functional contains beside the usual sparsity inducing term and fidelity term, a new term which induces similarity between overlapping patches in the overlap regions. The functional depends on two free regularization parameters: a coefficient multiplying the sparsity-inducing $L_{1}$ norm of the patch basis functions coefficients, and a coefficient multiplying the $L_{2}$ norm of the differences between patches in the overlapping regions. The solution is found by applying the iterative proximal gradient descent method with FISTA acceleration. In the case of tomography reconstruction we calculate the gradient by applying projection of the solution and its error backprojection at each iterative step. We study the quality of the solution, as a function of the regularization parameters and noise, on synthetic datas for which the solution is a-priori known. We apply the method on experimental data in the case of Differential Phase Tomography. For this case we use an original approach which consists in using vectorial patches, each patch having two components: one per each gradient component. The resulting algorithm, implemented in the ESRF tomography reconstruction code PyHST, results to be robust, efficient, and well adapted to strongly reduce the required dose and the number of projections in medical tomography.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound imaging is an incontestable vital tool for diagnosis, it provides in non-invasive manner the internal structure of the body to detect eventually diseases or abnormalities tissues. Unfortunately, the presence of speckle noise in these images affects edges and fine details which limit the contrast resolution and make diagnostic more difficult. In this paper, we propose a denoising approach which combines logarithmic transformation and a non linear diffusion tensor. Since speckle noise is multiplicative and nonwhite process, the logarithmic transformation is a reasonable choice to convert signaldependent or pure multiplicative noise to an additive one. The key idea from using diffusion tensor is to adapt the flow diffusion towards the local orientation by applying anisotropic diffusion along the coherent structure direction of interesting features in the image. To illustrate the effective performance of our algorithm, we present some experimental results on synthetically and real echographic images.

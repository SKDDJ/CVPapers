- **Summary**: Owing to the edge preserving ability and low computational cost of the total variation (TV), variational models with the TV regularization have been widely investigated in the field of multiplicative noise removal. The key points of the successful application of these models lie in: the optimal selection of the regularization parameter which balances the data-fidelity term with the TV regularizer; the efficient algorithm to compute the solution. In this paper, we propose two fast algorithms based on the linearized technique, which are able to estimate the regularization parameter and recover the image simultaneously. In the iteration step of the proposed algorithms, the regularization parameter is adjusted by a special discrepancy function defined for multiplicative noise. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are proved under certain conditions, and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms overall outperform some state-of-the-art methods in the PSNR values and computational time.

- **Summary**: Wavelet domain inpainting refers to the process of recovering the missing coefficients during the image compression or transmission stage. Recently, an efficient algorithm framework which is called Bregmanized operator splitting (BOS) was proposed for solving the classical variational model of wavelet inpainting. However, it is still time-consuming to some extent due to the inner iteration. In this paper, a novel variational model is established to formulate this reconstruction problem from the view of image decomposition. Then an efficient iterative algorithm based on the split-Bregman method is adopted to calculate an optimal solution, and it is also proved to be convergent. Compared with the BOS algorithm the proposed algorithm avoids the inner iteration and hence is more simple. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is very efficient and outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the computational time.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a semantic segmentation method for outdoor scenes captured by a surveillance camera. Our algorithm classifies each perceptually homogenous region as one of the predefined classes learned from a collection of manually labelled images. The proposed approach combines two different types of information. First, color segmentation is performed to divide the scene into perceptually similar regions. Then, the second step is based on SIFT keypoints and uses the bag of words representation of the regions for the classification. The prediction is done using a Na\"ive Bayesian Network as a generative classifier. Compared to existing techniques, our method provides more compact representations of scene contents and the segmentation result is more consistent with human perception due to the combination of the color information with the image keypoints. The experiments conducted on a publicly available data set demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The following work outlines an approach for automatic detection and recognition of periodic pulse train signals using a multi-stage process based on spectrogram edge detection, energy projection and classification. The method has been implemented to automatically detect and recognize pulse train songs of minke whales. While the long term goal of this work is to properly identify and detect minke songs from large multi-year datasets, this effort was developed using sounds off the coast of Massachusetts, in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. The detection methodology is presented and evaluated on 232 continuous hours of acoustic recordings and a qualitative analysis of machine learning classifiers and their performance is described. The trained automatic detection and classification system is applied to 120 continuous hours, comprised of various challenges such as broadband and narrowband noises, low SNR, and other pulse train signatures. This automatic system achieves a TPR of 63% for FPR of 0.6% (or 0.87 FP/h), at a Precision (PPV) of 84% and an F1 score of 71%.

- **Summary**: Feature encoding with respect to an over-complete dictionary learned by unsupervised methods, followed by spatial pyramid pooling, and linear classification, has exhibited powerful strength in various vision applications. Here we propose to use the feature learning pipeline for visual tracking. Tracking is implemented using tracking-by-detection and the resulted framework is very simple yet effective. First, online dictionary learning is used to build a dictionary, which captures the appearance changes of the tracking target as well as the background changes. Given a test image window, we extract local image patches from it and each local patch is encoded with respect to the dictionary. The encoded features are then pooled over a spatial pyramid to form an aggregated feature vector. Finally, a simple linear classifier is trained on these features.   Our experiments show that the proposed powerful---albeit simple---tracker, outperforms all the state-of-the-art tracking methods that we have tested. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of different dictionary learning and feature encoding methods in the proposed tracking framework, and analyse the impact of each component in the tracking scenario. We also demonstrate the flexibility of feature learning by plugging it into Hare et al.'s tracking method. The outcome is, to our knowledge, the best tracker ever reported, which facilitates the advantages of both feature learning and structured output prediction.

- **Summary**: The problem of minimizing the Potts energy function frequently occurs in computer vision applications. One way to tackle this NP-hard problem was proposed by Kovtun [19,20]. It identifies a part of an optimal solution by running $k$ maxflow computations, where $k$ is the number of labels. The number of "labeled" pixels can be significant in some applications, e.g. 50-93% in our tests for stereo. We show how to reduce the runtime to $O(\log k)$ maxflow computations (or one {\em parametric maxflow} computation). Furthermore, the output of our algorithm allows to speed-up the subsequent alpha expansion for the unlabeled part, or can be used as it is for time-critical applications.   To derive our technique, we generalize the algorithm of Felzenszwalb et al. [7] for {\em Tree Metrics}. We also show a connection to {\em $k$-submodular functions} from combinatorial optimization, and discuss {\em $k$-submodular relaxations} for general energy functions.

- **Summary**: The problem of detecting and recognizing text in natural scenes has proved to be more challenging than its counterpart in documents, with most of the previous work focusing on a single part of the problem. In this work, we propose new solutions to the character and word recognition problems and then show how to combine these solutions in an end-to-end text-recognition system. We do so by leveraging the recently introduced Maxout networks along with hybrid HMM models that have proven useful for voice recognition. Using these elements, we build a tunable and highly accurate recognition system that beats state-of-the-art results on all the sub-problems for both the ICDAR 2003 and SVT benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: In this article, a video base early fire alarm system is developed by monitoring the smoke in the scene. There are two major contributions in this work. First, to find the best texture feature for smoke detection, a general framework, named Histograms of Equivalent Patterns (HEP), is adopted to achieve an extensive evaluation of various kinds of texture features. Second, the \emph{Block based Inter-Frame Difference} (BIFD) and a improved version of LBP-TOP are proposed and ensembled to describe the space-time characteristics of the smoke. In order to reduce the false alarms, the Smoke History Image (SHI) is utilized to register the recent classification results of candidate smoke blocks. Experimental results using SVM show that the proposed method can achieve better accuracy and less false alarm compared with the state-of-the-art technologies.

- **Summary**: We want to approximate the mxn image A from scanned astronomical photographic plates (from the Sofia Sky Archive Data Center) by using far fewer entries than in the original matrix. By using rank of a matrix, k we remove the redundant information or noise and use as Wiener filter, when rank k<m or k<n. With this approximation more than 98% compression ration of image of astronomical plate without that image details, is obtained. The SVD of images from scanned photographic plates (SPP) is considered and its possible image compression.

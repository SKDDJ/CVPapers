- **Summary**: We present a Bayesian probabilistic model to estimate the brain white matter atlas from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data. This model incorporates a shape prior of the white matter anatomy and the likelihood of individual observed HARDI datasets. We first assume that the atlas is generated from a known hyperatlas through a flow of diffeomorphisms and its shape prior can be constructed based on the framework of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). LDDMM characterizes a nonlinear diffeomorphic shape space in a linear space of initial momentum uniquely determining diffeomorphic geodesic flows from the hyperatlas. Therefore, the shape prior of the HARDI atlas can be modeled using a centered Gaussian random field (GRF) model of the initial momentum. In order to construct the likelihood of observed HARDI datasets, it is necessary to study the diffeomorphic transformation of individual observations relative to the atlas and the probabilistic distribution of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). To this end, we construct the likelihood related to the transformation using the same construction as discussed for the shape prior of the atlas. The probabilistic distribution of ODFs is then constructed based on the ODF Riemannian manifold. We assume that the observed ODFs are generated by an exponential map of random tangent vectors at the deformed atlas ODF. Hence, the likelihood of the ODFs can be modeled using a GRF of their tangent vectors in the ODF Riemannian manifold. We solve for the maximum a posteriori using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and derive the corresponding update equations. Finally, we illustrate the HARDI atlas constructed based on a Chinese aging cohort of 94 adults and compare it with that generated by averaging the coefficients of spherical harmonics of the ODF across subjects.

- **Summary**: Many computer vision and medical imaging problems are faced with learning from large-scale datasets, with millions of observations and features. In this paper we propose a novel efficient learning scheme that tightens a sparsity constraint by gradually removing variables based on a criterion and a schedule. The attractive fact that the problem size keeps dropping throughout the iterations makes it particularly suitable for big data learning. Our approach applies generically to the optimization of any differentiable loss function, and finds applications in regression, classification and ranking. The resultant algorithms build variable screening into estimation and are extremely simple to implement. We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and selection consistency. In addition, one dimensional piecewise linear response functions are used to account for nonlinearity and a second order prior is imposed on these functions to avoid overfitting. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that the proposed method compares very well with other state of the art methods in regression, classification and ranking while being computationally very efficient and scalable.

- **Summary**: We develop a framework for extracting a concise representation of the shape information available from diffuse shading in a small image patch. This produces a mid-level scene descriptor, comprised of local shape distributions that are inferred separately at every image patch across multiple scales. The framework is based on a quadratic representation of local shape that, in the absence of noise, has guarantees on recovering accurate local shape and lighting. And when noise is present, the inferred local shape distributions provide useful shape information without over-committing to any particular image explanation. These local shape distributions naturally encode the fact that some smooth diffuse regions are more informative than others, and they enable efficient and robust reconstruction of object-scale shape. Experimental results show that this approach to surface reconstruction compares well against the state-of-art on both synthetic images and captured photographs.

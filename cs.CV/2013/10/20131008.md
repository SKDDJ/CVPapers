- **Summary**: The amount of collected data in many scientific fields is increasing, all of them requiring a common task: extract knowledge from massive, multi parametric data sets, as rapidly and efficiently possible. This is especially true in astronomy where synoptic sky surveys are enabling new research frontiers in the time domain astronomy and posing several new object classification challenges in multi dimensional spaces; given the high number of parameters available for each object, feature selection is quickly becoming a crucial task in analyzing astronomical data sets. Using data sets extracted from the ongoing Catalina Real-Time Transient Surveys (CRTS) and the Kepler Mission we illustrate a variety of feature selection strategies used to identify the subsets that give the most information and the results achieved applying these techniques to three major astronomical problems.

- **Summary**: In this paper we address the problem of visual quality of images reconstructed from block-wise random projections. Independent reconstruction of the blocks can severely affect visual quality, by displaying artifacts along block borders. We propose a method to enforce smoothness across block borders by modifying the sensing and reconstruction process so as to employ partially overlapping blocks. The proposed algorithm accomplishes this by computing a fast preview from the blocks, whose purpose is twofold. On one hand, it allows to enforce a set of constraints to drive the reconstruction algorithm towards a smooth solution, imposing the similarity of block borders. On the other hand, the preview is used as a predictor of the entire block, allowing to recover the prediction error, only. The quality improvement over the result of independent reconstruction can be easily assessed both visually and in terms of PSNR and SSIM index.

- **Summary**: That the Microsoft Kinect, an RGB-D sensor, transformed the gaming and end consumer sector has been anticipated by the developers. That it also impacted in rigorous computer vision research has probably been a surprise to the whole community. Shortly before the commercial deployment of its successor, Kinect One, the research literature fills with resumees and state-of-the art papers to summarize the development over the past 3 years. This particular report describes significant research projects which have built on sensoring setups that include two or more RGB-D sensors in one scene.

- **Summary**: The advent of the Microsoft Kinect three years ago stimulated not only the computer vision community for new algorithms and setups to tackle well-known problems in the community but also sparked the launch of several new benchmark datasets to which future algorithms can be compared 019 to. This review of the literature and industry developments concludes that the current RGB-D benchmark datasets can be useful to determine the accuracy of a variety of applications of a single or multiple RGB-D sensors.

- **Summary**: In this paper, an iterative method for robust deconvolution with positivity constraints is discussed. It is based on the known variational interpretation of the Richardson-Lucy iterative deconvolution as fixed-point iteration for the minimisation of an information divergence functional under a multiplicative perturbation model. The asymmetric penaliser function involved in this functional is then modified into a robust penaliser, and complemented with a regulariser. The resulting functional gives rise to a fixed point iteration that we call robust and regularised Richardson-Lucy deconvolution. It achieves an image restoration quality comparable to state-of-the-art robust variational deconvolution with a computational efficiency similar to that of the original Richardson-Lucy method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world image data demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

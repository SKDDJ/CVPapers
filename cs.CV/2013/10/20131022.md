- **Summary**: Salient object detection aims to locate objects that capture human attention within images. Previous approaches often pose this as a problem of image contrast analysis. In this work, we model an image as a hypergraph that utilizes a set of hyperedges to capture the contextual properties of image pixels or regions. As a result, the problem of salient object detection becomes one of finding salient vertices and hyperedges in the hypergraph. The main advantage of hypergraph modeling is that it takes into account each pixel's (or region's) affinity with its neighborhood as well as its separation from image background. Furthermore, we propose an alternative approach based on center-versus-surround contextual contrast analysis, which performs salient object detection by optimizing a cost-sensitive support vector machine (SVM) objective function. Experimental results on four challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches against the state-of-the-art approaches to salient object detection.

- **Summary**: The ability for an autonomous agent to self-localise is directly proportional to the accuracy and precision with which it can perceive salient features within its local environment. The identification of such features by recognising geometric profile allows robustness against lighting variations, which is necessary in most industrial robotics applications. This paper details a framework by which the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, often applied to parameter fitting in linear models, can be extended to identify higher-order geometric features. Goalpost identification within humanoid robot soccer is investigated as an application, with the developed system yielding an order-of-magnitude improvement in classification performance relative to a traditional histogramming methodology.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral imaging, due to providing high spectral resolution images, is one of the most important tools in the remote sensing field. Because of technological restrictions hyperspectral sensors has a limited spatial resolution. On the other hand panchromatic image has a better spatial resolution. Combining this information together can provide a better understanding of the target scene. Spectral unmixing of mixed pixels in hyperspectral images results in spectral signature and abundance fractions of endmembers but gives no information about their location in a mixed pixel. In this paper we have used spectral unmixing results of hyperspectral images and segmentation results of panchromatic image for data fusion. The proposed method has been applied on simulated data using AVRIS Indian Pines datasets. Results show that this method can effectively combine information in hyperspectral and panchromatic images.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy is a medical condition where the retina is damaged because fluid leaks from blood vessels into the retina. The presence of hemorrhages in the retina is the earliest symptom of diabetic retinopathy. The number and shape of hemorrhages is used to indicate the severity of the disease. Early automated hemorrhage detection can help reduce the incidence of blindness. This paper introduced new method depending on the hemorrhage shape to detect the dot hemorrhage (DH), its number, and size at early stage, this can be achieved by reducing the retinal image details. Detection and recognize the DH by following three sequential steps, removing the fovea, removing the vasculature and recognize DH by determining the circularity for all the objects in the image, finally determine the shape factor which is related to DH recognition, this stage strengthens the recognition process. The proposed method recognizes and separates all the DH.

- **Summary**: There is a large collection of Handwritten English paper documents of Historical and Scientific importance. But paper documents are not recognized directly by computer. Hence the closest way of indexing these documents is by storing their document digital image. Hence a large database of document images can replace the paper documents. But the document and data corresponding to each image cannot be directly recognized by the computer.   This paper applies the technique of word spotting using Modified Character Shape Code to Handwritten English document images for quick and efficient query search of words on a database of document images. It is different from other Word Spotting techniques as it implements two level of selection for word segments to match search query. First based on word size and then based on character shape code of query. It makes the process faster and more efficient and reduces the need of multiple pre-processing.

- **Summary**: This paper is aimed at developing and combining different algorithms for face detection and face recognition to generate an efficient mechanism that can detect and recognize the facial regions of input image. For the detection of face from complex region, skin segmentation isolates the face-like regions in a complex image and following operations of morphology and template matching rejects false matches to extract facial region. For the recognition of the face, the image database is now converted into a database of facial segments. Hence, implementing the technique of Elastic Bunch Graph matching (EBGM) after skin segmentation generates Face Bunch Graphs that acutely represents the features of an individual face enhances the quality of the training set. This increases the matching probability significantly.

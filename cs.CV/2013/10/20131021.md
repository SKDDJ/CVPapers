- **Summary**: There have been intensive research interests in ship detection and segmentation due to high demands on a wide range of civil applications in the last two decades. However, existing approaches, which are mainly based on statistical properties of images, fail to detect smaller ships and boats. Specifically, known techniques are not robust enough in view of inevitable small geometric and photometric changes in images consisting of ships. In this paper a novel approach for ship detection is proposed based on correlation of maritime images. The idea comes from the observation that a fine pattern of the sea surface changes considerably from time to time whereas the ship appearance basically keeps unchanged. We want to examine whether the images have a common unaltered part, a ship in this case. To this end, we developed a method - Focused Correlation (FC) to achieve robustness to geometric distortions of the image content. Various experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a Devnagari Numerical recognition method based on statistical discriminant functions. 17 geometric features based on pixel connectivity, lines, line directions, holes, image area, perimeter, eccentricity, solidity, orientation etc. are used for representing the numerals. Five discriminant functions viz. Linear, Quadratic, Diaglinear, Diagquadratic and Mahalanobis distance are used for classification. 1500 handwritten numerals are used for training. Another 1500 handwritten numerals are used for testing. Experimental results show that Linear, Quadratic and Mahalanobis discriminant functions provide better results. Results of these three Discriminants are fed to a majority voting type Combination classifier. It is found that Combination classifier offers better results over individual classifiers.

- **Summary**: We obtain an improved finite-sample guarantee on the linear convergence of stochastic gradient descent for smooth and strongly convex objectives, improving from a quadratic dependence on the conditioning $(L/\mu)^2$ (where $L$ is a bound on the smoothness and $\mu$ on the strong convexity) to a linear dependence on $L/\mu$. Furthermore, we show how reweighting the sampling distribution (i.e. importance sampling) is necessary in order to further improve convergence, and obtain a linear dependence in the average smoothness, dominating previous results. We also discuss importance sampling for SGD more broadly and show how it can improve convergence also in other scenarios. Our results are based on a connection we make between SGD and the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, which allows us to transfer ideas between the separate bodies of literature studying each of the two methods. In particular, we recast the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm as an instance of SGD, and apply our results to prove its exponential convergence, but to the solution of a weighted least squares problem rather than the original least squares problem. We then present a modified Kaczmarz algorithm with partially biased sampling which does converge to the original least squares solution with the same exponential convergence rate.

- **Summary**: In this contribution, a novel method for stent simulation in preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) acquisitions of patients is presented where the sealing zones are automatically calculated and visualized. The method is eligible for non-bifurcated and bifurcated stents (Y-stents). Results of the proposed stent simulation with an automatic calculation of the sealing zones for specific diseases (abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), iliac aneurysms) are presented. The contribution is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed approach. In Section 3, experimental results are discussed. Section 4 concludes the contribution and outlines areas for future work.

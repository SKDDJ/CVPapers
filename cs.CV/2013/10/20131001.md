- **Summary**: We propose a new framework for object detection based on a generalization of the keypoint correspondence framework. This framework is based on replacing keypoints by keygraphs, i.e. isomorph directed graphs whose vertices are keypoints, in order to explore relative and structural information. Unlike similar works in the literature, we deal directly with graphs in the entire pipeline: we search for graph correspondences instead of searching for individual point correspondences and then building graph correspondences from them afterwards. We also estimate the pose from graph correspondences instead of falling back to point correspondences through a voting table. The contributions of this paper are the proposed framework and an implementation that properly handles its inherent issues of loss of locality and combinatorial explosion, showing its viability for real-time applications. In particular, we introduce the novel concept of keytuples to solve a running time issue. The accuracy of the implementation is shown by results of over 800 experiments with a well-known database of images. The speed is illustrated by real-time tracking with two different cameras in ordinary hardware.

- **Summary**: Surface registration is a technique that is used in various areas such as object recognition and 3D model reconstruction. Problem of surface registration can be analyzed as an optimization problem of seeking a rigid motion between two different views. Genetic algorithms can be used for solving this optimization problem, both for obtaining the robust parameter estimation and for its fine-tuning. The main drawback of genetic algorithms is that they are time consuming which makes them unsuitable for online applications. Modern acquisition systems enable the implementation of the solutions that would immediately give the information on the rotational angles between the different views, thus reducing the dimension of the optimization problem. The paper gives an analysis of the genetic algorithm implemented in the conditions when the rotation matrix is known and a comparison of these results with results when this information is not available.

- **Summary**: Breast tissue segmentation into dense and fat tissue is important for determining the breast density in mammograms. Knowing the breast density is important both in diagnostic and computer-aided detection applications. There are many different ways to express the density of a breast and good quality segmentation should provide the possibility to perform accurate classification no matter which classification rule is being used. Knowing the right breast density and having the knowledge of changes in the breast density could give a hint of a process which started to happen within a patient. Mammograms generally suffer from a problem of different tissue overlapping which results in the possibility of inaccurate detection of tissue types. Fibroglandular tissue presents rather high attenuation of X-rays and is visible as brighter in the resulting image but overlapping fibrous tissue and blood vessels could easily be replaced with fibroglandular tissue in automatic segmentation algorithms. Small blood vessels and microcalcifications are also shown as bright objects with similar intensities as dense tissue but do have some properties which makes possible to suppress them from the final results. In this paper we try to divide dense and fat tissue by suppressing the scattered structures which do not represent glandular or dense tissue in order to divide mammograms more accurately in the two major tissue types. For suppressing blood vessels and microcalcifications we have used Gabor filters of different size and orientation and a combination of morphological operations on filtered image with enhanced contrast.

- **Summary**: Most visual quality inspections in discrete manufacturing are composed of length, surface, angle or intensity measurements. Those are implemented as end-user configurable inspection tools that should not require an image processing expert to set up. Currently available software solutions providing such capability use a flowchart based programming environment, but do not fully address an inspection flowchart robustness and can require a redefinition of the flowchart if a small variation is introduced. In this paper we propose an acquire-register-analyze image processing pattern designed for discrete manufacturing that aims to increase the robustness of the inspection flowchart by consistently addressing variations in product position, orientation and size. A proposed pattern is transparent to the end-user and simplifies the flowchart. We describe a developed software solution that is a practical implementation of the proposed pattern. We give an example of its real-life use in industrial production of electric components.



### Using the Random Sprays Retinex Algorithm for Global Illumination Estimation

- **Summary**: In this paper the use of Random Sprays Retinex (RSR) algorithm for global illumination estimation is proposed and its feasibility tested. Like other algorithms based on the Retinex model, RSR also provides local illumination estimation and brightness adjustment for each pixel and it is faster than other path-wise Retinex algorithms. As the assumption of the uniform illumination holds in many cases, it should be possible to use the mean of local illumination estimations of RSR as a global illumination estimation for images with (assumed) uniform illumination allowing also the accuracy to be easily measured. Therefore we propose a method for estimating global illumination estimation based on local RSR results. To our best knowledge this is the first time that RSR algorithm is used to obtain global illumination estimation. For our tests we use a publicly available color constancy image database for testing. The results are presented and discussed and it turns out that the proposed method outperforms many existing unsupervised color constancy algorithms.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes combining spatio-temporal appearance (STA) descriptors with optical flow for human action recognition. The STA descriptors are local histogram-based descriptors of space-time, suitable for building a partial representation of arbitrary spatio-temporal phenomena. Because of the possibility of iterative refinement, they are interesting in the context of online human action recognition. We investigate the use of dense optical flow as the image function of the STA descriptor for human action recognition, using two different algorithms for computing the flow: the Farneb\"ack algorithm and the TVL1 algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the influencing optical flow algorithm parameters on the produced optical flow fields. An extensive experimental validation of optical flow-based STA descriptors in human action recognition is performed on the KTH human action dataset. The encouraging experimental results suggest the potential of our approach in online human action recognition.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present a novel dataset for assessing the accuracy of stereo visual odometry. The dataset has been acquired by a small-baseline stereo rig mounted on the top of a moving car. The groundtruth is supplied by a consumer grade GPS device without IMU. Synchronization and alignment between GPS readings and stereo frames are recovered after the acquisition. We show that the attained groundtruth accuracy allows to draw useful conclusions in practice. The presented experiments address influence of camera calibration, baseline distance and zero-disparity features to the achieved reconstruction performance.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of multiclass road sign detection using a classification function with multiplicative kernel comprised from two kernels. We show that problems of detection and within-foreground classification can be jointly solved by using one kernel to measure object-background differences and another one to account for within-class variations. The main idea behind this approach is that road signs from different foreground variations can share features that discriminate them from backgrounds. The classification function training is accomplished using SVM, thus feature sharing is obtained through support vector sharing. Training yields a family of linear detectors, where each detector corresponds to a specific foreground training sample. The redundancy among detectors is alleviated using k-medoids clustering. Finally, we report detection and classification results on a set of road sign images obtained from a camera on a moving vehicle.

- **Summary**: Global localization of a mobile robot using planar surface segments extracted from depth images is considered. The robot's environment is represented by a topological map consisting of local models, each representing a particular location modeled by a set of planar surface segments. The discussed localization approach segments a depth image acquired by a 3D camera into planar surface segments which are then matched to model surface segments. The robot pose is estimated by the Extended Kalman Filter using surface segment pairs as measurements. The reliability and accuracy of the considered approach are experimentally evaluated using a mobile robot equipped by a Microsoft Kinect sensor.

- **Summary**: The number of road vehicles significantly increased in recent decades. This trend accompanied a build-up of road infrastructure and development of various control systems to increase road traffic safety, road capacity and travel comfort. In traffic safety significant development has been made and today's systems more and more include cameras and computer vision methods. Cameras are used as part of the road infrastructure or in vehicles. In this paper a review on computer vision systems in vehicles from the stand point of traffic engineering is given. Safety problems of road vehicles are presented, current state of the art in-vehicle vision systems is described and open problems with future research directions are discussed.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates classification of traffic scenes in a very low bandwidth scenario, where an image should be coded by a small number of features. We introduce a novel dataset, called the FM1 dataset, consisting of 5615 images of eight different traffic scenes: open highway, open road, settlement, tunnel, tunnel exit, toll booth, heavy traffic and the overpass. We evaluate the suitability of the GIST descriptor as a representation of these images, first by exploring the descriptor space using PCA and k-means clustering, and then by using an SVM classifier and recording its 10-fold cross-validation performance on the introduced FM1 dataset. The obtained recognition rates are very encouraging, indicating that the use of the GIST descriptor alone could be sufficiently descriptive even when very high performance is required.

- **Summary**: In this work various methods and algorithms for face and eyes detection are examined in order to decide which of them are applicable for use in a driver fatigue monitoring system. In the case of face detection the standard Viola-Jones face detector has shown best results, while the method of finding the eye centers by means of gradients has proven to be most appropriate in the case of eyes detection. The later method has also a potential for retrieving behavioral parameters needed for estimation of the level of driver fatigue. This possibility will be examined in future work.

- **Summary**: We extend the concept of optical flow with spatiotemporal regularisation to a dynamic non-Euclidean setting. Optical flow is traditionally computed from a sequence of flat images. The purpose of this paper is to introduce variational motion estimation for images that are defined on an evolving surface. Volumetric microscopy images depicting a live zebrafish embryo serve as both biological motivation and test data.

- **Summary**: Feedforward multilayer networks trained by supervised learning have recently demonstrated state of the art performance on image labeling problems such as boundary prediction and scene parsing. As even very low error rates can limit practical usage of such systems, methods that perform closer to human accuracy remain desirable. In this work, we propose a new type of network with the following properties that address what we hypothesize to be limiting aspects of existing methods: (1) a `wide' structure with thousands of features, (2) a large field of view, (3) recursive iterations that exploit statistical dependencies in label space, and (4) a parallelizable architecture that can be trained in a fraction of the time compared to benchmark multilayer convolutional networks. For the specific image labeling problem of boundary prediction, we also introduce a novel example weighting algorithm that improves segmentation accuracy. Experiments in the challenging domain of connectomic reconstruction of neural circuity from 3d electron microscopy data show that these "Deep And Wide Multiscale Recursive" (DAWMR) networks lead to new levels of image labeling performance. The highest performing architecture has twelve layers, interwoven supervised and unsupervised stages, and uses an input field of view of 157,464 voxels ($54^3$) to make a prediction at each image location. We present an associated open source software package that enables the simple and flexible creation of DAWMR networks.

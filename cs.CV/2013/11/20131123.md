- **Summary**: Wepresentanovelcolumngenerationbasedboostingmethod for multi-class classification. Our multi-class boosting is formulated in a single optimization problem as in Shen and Hao (2011). Different from most existing multi-class boosting methods, which use the same set of weak learners for all the classes, we train class specified weak learners (i.e., each class has a different set of weak learners). We show that using separate weak learner sets for each class leads to fast convergence, without introducing additional computational overhead in the training procedure. To further make the training more efficient and scalable, we also propose a fast co- ordinate descent method for solving the optimization problem at each boosting iteration. The proposed coordinate descent method is conceptually simple and easy to implement in that it is a closed-form solution for each coordinate update. Experimental results on a variety of datasets show that, compared to a range of existing multi-class boosting meth- ods, the proposed method has much faster convergence rate and better generalization performance in most cases. We also empirically show that the proposed fast coordinate descent algorithm needs less training time than the MultiBoost algorithm in Shen and Hao (2011).

- **Summary**: Advances in computing technology have allowed researchers across many fields of endeavor to collect and maintain vast amounts of observational statistical data such as clinical data, biological patient data, data regarding access of web sites, financial data, and the like. This paper addresses some of the challenging issues on brain magnetic resonance (MR) image tumor segmentation caused by the weak correlation between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity and anatomical meaning. With the objective of utilizing more meaningful information to improve brain tumor segmentation, an approach which employs bilateral symmetry information as an additional feature for segmentation is proposed. This is motivated by potential performance improvement in the general automatic brain tumor segmentation systems which are important for many medical and scientific applications

- **Summary**: Emotions are best way of communicating information; and sometimes it carry more information than words. Recently, there has been a huge interest in automatic recognition of human emotion because of its wide spread application in security, surveillance, marketing, advertisement, and human-computer interaction. To communicate with a computer in a natural way, it will be desirable to use more natural modes of human communication based on voice, gestures and facial expressions. In this paper, a holistic approach for facial expression recognition is proposed which captures the variation in facial features in temporal domain and classifies the sequence of images in different emotions. The proposed method uses Haar-like features to detect face in an image. The dimensionality of the eigenspace is reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By projecting the subsequent face images into principal eigen directions, the variation pattern of the obtained weight vector is modeled to classify it into different emotions. Owing to the variations of expressions for different people and its intensity, a person specific method for emotion recognition is followed. Using the gray scale images of the frontal face, the system is able to classify four basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger.

- **Summary**: We propose an extension of popular descriptors based on gradient orientation histograms (HOG, computed in a single image) to multiple views. It hinges on interpreting HOG as a conditional density in the space of sampled images, where the effects of nuisance factors such as viewpoint and illumination are marginalized. However, such marginalization is performed with respect to a very coarse approximation of the underlying distribution. Our extension leverages on the fact that multiple views of the same scene allow separating intrinsic from nuisance variability, and thus afford better marginalization of the latter. The result is a descriptor that has the same complexity of single-view HOG, and can be compared in the same manner, but exploits multiple views to better trade off insensitivity to nuisance variability with specificity to intrinsic variability. We also introduce a novel multi-view wide-baseline matching dataset, consisting of a mixture of real and synthetic objects with ground truthed camera motion and dense three-dimensional geometry.

- **Summary**: Skin recognition is used in many applications ranging from algorithms for face detection, hand gesture analysis, and to objectionable image filtering. In this work a skin recognition system was developed and tested. While many skin segmentation algorithms relay on skin color, our work relies on both skin color and texture features (features derives from the GLCM) to give a better and more efficient recognition accuracy of skin textures. We used feed forward neural networks to classify input textures images to be skin or non skin textures. The system gave very encouraging results during the neural network generalization face.

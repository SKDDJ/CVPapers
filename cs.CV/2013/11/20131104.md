- **Summary**: A limitation of many compressive imaging architectures lies in the sequential nature of the sensing process, which leads to long sensing times. In this paper we present a novel architecture that uses fewer detectors than the number of reconstructed pixels and is able to acquire the image in a single acquisition. This paves the way for the development of video architectures that acquire several frames per second. We specifically address the diffraction problem, showing that deconvolution normally used to recover diffraction blur can be replaced by convolution of the sensing matrix, and how measurements of a 0/1 physical sensing matrix can be converted to -1/1 compressive sensing matrix without any extra acquisitions. Simulations of our architecture show that the image quality is comparable to that of a classic Compressive Imaging camera, whereas the proposed architecture avoids long acquisition times due to sequential sensing. This one-shot procedure also allows to employ a fixed sensing matrix instead of a complex device such as a Digital Micro Mirror array or Spatial Light Modulator. It also enables imaging at bandwidths where these are not efficient.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel topic discovery algorithm for unlabeled images based on the bag-of-words (BoW) framework. We first extract a dictionary of visual words and subsequently for each image compute a visual word occurrence histogram. We view these histograms as rows of a large matrix from which we extract sparse principal components (PCs). Each PC identifies a sparse combination of visual words which co-occur frequently in some images but seldom appear in others. Each sparse PC corresponds to a topic, and images whose interference with the PC is high belong to that topic, revealing the common parts possessed by the images. We propose to solve the associated sparse PCA problems using an Alternating Maximization (AM) method, which we modify for purpose of efficiently extracting multiple PCs in a deflation scheme. Our approach attacks the maximization problem in sparse PCA directly and is scalable to high-dimensional data. Experiments on automatic topic discovery and category prediction demonstrate encouraging performance of our approach.

- **Summary**: Compressed sensing (CS) shows that a signal having a sparse or compressible representation can be recovered from a small set of linear measurements. In classical CS theory, the sampling matrix and representation matrix are assumed to be known exactly in advance. However, uncertainties exist due to sampling distortion, finite grids of the parameter space of dictionary, etc. In this paper, we take a generalized sparse signal model, which simultaneously considers the sampling and representation matrix uncertainties. Based on the new signal model, a new optimization model for robust sparse signal reconstruction is proposed. This optimization model can be deduced with stochastic robust approximation analysis. Both convex relaxation and greedy algorithms are used to solve the optimization problem. For the convex relaxation method, a sufficient condition for recovery by convex relaxation is given; For the greedy algorithm, it is realized by the introduction of a pre-processing of the sensing matrix and the measurements. In numerical experiments, both simulated data and real-life ECG data based results show that the proposed method has a better performance than the current methods.

- **Summary**: Since edge detection is in the forefront of image processing for object detection, it is crucial to have a good understanding of edge detection algorithms. The reason for this is that edges form the outline of an object. An edge is the boundary between an object and the background, and indicates the boundary between overlapping objects. This means that if the edges in an image can be identified accurately, all of the objects can be located and basic properties such as area, perimeter, and shape can be measured. Since computer vision involves the identification and classification of objects in an image, edge detection is an essential tool. We tested two edge detectors that use different methods for detecting edges and compared their results under a variety of situations to determine which detector was preferable under different sets of conditions.

- **Summary**: One of important components in an image retrieval system is selecting a distance measure to compute rank between two objects. In this paper, several distance measures were researched to implement a foliage plant retrieval system. Sixty kinds of foliage plants with various leaf color and shape were used to test the performance of 7 different kinds of distance measures: city block distance, Euclidean distance, Canberra distance, Bray-Curtis distance, x2 statistics, Jensen Shannon divergence and Kullback Leibler divergence. The results show that city block and Euclidean distance measures gave the best performance among the others.

- **Summary**: Several methods to identify plants have been proposed by several researchers. Commonly, the methods did not capture color information, because color was not recognized as an important aspect to the identification. In this research, shape and vein, color, and texture features were incorporated to classify a leaf. In this case, a neural network called Probabilistic Neural network (PNN) was used as a classifier. The experimental result shows that the method for classification gives average accuracy of 93.75% when it was tested on Flavia dataset, that contains 32 kinds of plant leaves. It means that the method gives better performance compared to the original work.

- **Summary**: Several researches in leaf identification did not include color information as features. The main reason is caused by a fact that they used green colored leaves as samples. However, for foliage plants, plants with colorful leaves, fancy patterns in their leaves, and interesting plants with unique shape, color and also texture could not be neglected. For example, Epipremnum pinnatum 'Aureum' and Epipremnum pinnatum 'Marble Queen' have similar patterns, same shape, but different colors. Combination of shape, color, texture features, and other attribute contained on the leaf is very useful in leaf identification. In this research, Polar Fourier Transform and three kinds of geometric features were used to represent shape features, color moments that consist of mean, standard deviation, skewness were used to represent color features, texture features are extracted from GLCMs, and vein features were added to improve performance of the identification system. The identification system uses Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) as a classifier. The result shows that the system gives average accuracy of 93.0833% for 60 kinds of foliage plants.

- **Summary**: Many computer vision problems require optimization of binary non-submodular energies. We propose a general optimization framework based on local submodular approximations (LSA). Unlike standard LP relaxation methods that linearize the whole energy globally, our approach iteratively approximates the energies locally. On the other hand, unlike standard local optimization methods (e.g. gradient descent or projection techniques) we use non-linear submodular approximations and optimize them without leaving the domain of integer solutions. We discuss two specific LSA algorithms based on "trust region" and "auxiliary function" principles, LSA-TR and LSA-AUX. These methods obtain state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications outperforming many standard techniques such as LBP, QPBO, and TRWS. While our paper is focused on pairwise energies, our ideas extend to higher-order problems. The code is available online (http://vision.csd.uwo.ca/code/).

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a simple yet fast and robust algorithm which exploits the spatio-temporal context for visual tracking. Our approach formulates the spatio-temporal relationships between the object of interest and its local context based on a Bayesian framework, which models the statistical correlation between the low-level features (i.e., image intensity and position) from the target and its surrounding regions. The tracking problem is posed by computing a confidence map, and obtaining the best target location by maximizing an object location likelihood function. The Fast Fourier Transform is adopted for fast learning and detection in this work. Implemented in MATLAB without code optimization, the proposed tracker runs at 350 frames per second on an i7 machine. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.

- **Summary**: The mean shift iterative algorithm was proposed in 2006, for using the entropy as a stopping criterion. From then on, a theoretical base has been developed and a group of applications has been carried out using this algorithm. This paper proposes a new stopping criterion for the mean shift iterative algorithm, where stopping threshold via entropy is used now, but in another way. Many segmentation experiments were carried out by utilizing standard images and it was verified that a better segmentation was reached, and that the algorithm had better stability. An analysis on the convergence, through a theorem, with the new stopping criterion was carried out. The goal of this paper is to compare the new stopping criterion with the old criterion. For this reason, the obtained results were not compared with other segmentation approaches, since with the old stopping criterion were previously carried out.

- **Summary**: High-order (non-linear) functionals have become very popular in segmentation, stereo and other computer vision problems. Level sets is a well established general gradient descent framework, which is directly applicable to optimization of such functionals and widely used in practice. Recently, another general optimization approach based on trust region methodology was proposed for regional non-linear functionals. Our goal is a comprehensive experimental comparison of these two frameworks in regard to practical efficiency, robustness to parameters, and optimality. We experiment on a wide range of problems with non-linear constraints on segment volume, appearance and shape.

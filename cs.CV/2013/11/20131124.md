- **Summary**: Data coding as a building block of several image processing algorithms has been received great attention recently. Indeed, the importance of the locality assumption in coding approaches is studied in numerous works and several methods are proposed based on this concept. We probe this assumption and claim that taking the similarity between a data point and a more global set of anchor points does not necessarily weaken the coding method as long as the underlying structure of the anchor points are taken into account. Based on this fact, we propose to capture this underlying structure by assuming a random walker over the anchor points. We show that our method is a fast approximate learning algorithm based on the diffusion map kernel. The experiments on various datasets show that making different state-of-the-art coding algorithms aware of this structure boosts them in different learning tasks.

- **Summary**: An "elephant in the room" for most current object detection and localization methods is the lack of explicit modelling of partial visibility due to occlusion by other objects or truncation by the image boundary. Based on a sliding window approach, we propose a detection method which explicitly models partial visibility by treating it as a latent variable. A novel non-maximum suppression scheme is proposed which takes into account the inferred partial visibility of objects while providing a globally optimal solution. The method gives more detailed scene interpretations than conventional detectors in that we are able to identify the visible parts of an object. We report improved average precision on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset compared to a baseline detector.

- **Summary**: The improvement of the accuracy of image query retrieval used image classification technique. Image classification is well known technique of supervised learning. The improved method of image classification increases the working efficiency of image query retrieval. For the improvements of classification technique we used RBF neural network function for better prediction of feature used in image retrieval.Colour content is represented by pixel values in image classification using radial base function(RBF) technique. This approach provides better result compare to SVM technique in image representation.Image is represented by matrix though RBF using pixel values of colour intensity of image. Firstly we using RGB colour model. In this colour model we use red, green and blue colour intensity values in matrix.SVM with partical swarm optimization for image classification is implemented in content of images which provide better Results based on the proposed approach are found encouraging in terms of color image classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: To produce images that are suitable for display, tone-mapping is widely used in digital cameras to map linear color measurements into narrow gamuts with limited dynamic range. This introduces non-linear distortion that must be undone, through a radiometric calibration process, before computer vision systems can analyze such photographs radiometrically. This paper considers the inherent uncertainty of undoing the effects of tone-mapping. We observe that this uncertainty varies substantially across color space, making some pixels more reliable than others. We introduce a model for this uncertainty and a method for fitting it to a given camera or imaging pipeline. Once fit, the model provides for each pixel in a tone-mapped digital photograph a probability distribution over linear scene colors that could have induced it. We demonstrate how these distributions can be useful for visual inference by incorporating them into estimation algorithms for a representative set of vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Image forgery localization is a very active and open research field for the difficulty to handle the large variety of manipulations a malicious user can perform by means of more and more sophisticated image editing tools. Here, we propose a localization framework based on the fusion of three very different tools, based, respectively, on sensor noise, patch-matching, and machine learning. The binary masks provided by these tools are finally fused based on some suitable reliability indexes. According to preliminary experiments on the training set, the proposed framework provides often a very good localization accuracy and sometimes valuable clues for visual scrutiny.

- **Summary**: Dense local descriptors and machine learning have been used with success in several applications, like classification of textures, steganalysis, and forgery detection. We develop a new image forgery detector building upon some descriptors recently proposed in the steganalysis field suitably merging some of such descriptors, and optimizing a SVM classifier on the available training set. Despite the very good performance, very small forgeries are hardly ever detected because they contribute very little to the descriptors. Therefore we also develop a simple, but extremely specific, copy-move detector based on region matching and fuse decisions so as to reduce the missing detection rate. Overall results appear to be extremely encouraging.

- **Summary**: Sparse coding has shown its power as an effective data representation method. However, up to now, all the sparse coding approaches are limited within the single domain learning problem. In this paper, we extend the sparse coding to cross domain learning problem, which tries to learn from a source domain to a target domain with significant different distribution. We impose the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion to reduce the cross-domain distribution difference of sparse codes, and also regularize the sparse codes by the class labels of the samples from both domains to increase the discriminative ability. The encouraging experiment results of the proposed cross-domain sparse coding algorithm on two challenging tasks --- image classification of photograph and oil painting domains, and multiple user spam detection --- show the advantage of the proposed method over other cross-domain data representation methods.

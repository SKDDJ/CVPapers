- **Summary**: Character identification plays a vital role in the contemporary world of Image processing. It can solve many composite problems and makes humans work easier. An instance is Handwritten Character detection. Handwritten recognition is not a novel expertise, but it has not gained community notice until Now. The eventual aim of designing Handwritten Character recognition structure with an accurateness rate of 100% is pretty illusionary. Tamil Handwritten Character recognition system uses the Neural Networks to distinguish them. Neural Network and structural characteristics are used to instruct and recognize written characters. After training and testing the exactness rate reached 99%. This correctness rate is extremely high. In this paper we are exploring image processing through the Hilditch algorithm foundation and structural characteristics of a character in the image. And we recognized some character of the Tamil language, and we are trying to identify all the character of Tamil In our future works.

- **Summary**: A standard way to approximate the distance between any two vertices $p$ and $q$ on a mesh is to compute, in the associated graph, a shortest path from $p$ to $q$ that goes through one of $k$ sources, which are well-chosen vertices. Precomputing the distance between each of the $k$ sources to all vertices of the graph yields an efficient computation of approximate distances between any two vertices. One standard method for choosing $k$ sources, which has been used extensively and successfully for isometry-invariant surface processing, is the so-called Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), which starts with a random vertex as the first source, and iteratively selects the farthest vertex from the already selected sources.   In this paper, we analyze the stretch factor $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ of approximate geodesics computed using FPS, which is the maximum, over all pairs of distinct vertices, of their approximated distance over their geodesic distance in the graph. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}$ can be bounded in terms of the minimal value $\mathcal{F}^*$ of the stretch factor obtained using an optimal placement of $k$ sources as $\mathcal{F}_{FPS}\leq 2 r_e^2 \mathcal{F}^*+ 2 r_e^2 + 8 r_e + 1$, where $r_e$ is the ratio of the lengths of the longest and the shortest edges of the graph. This provides some evidence explaining why farthest point sampling has been used successfully for isometry-invariant shape processing. Furthermore, we show that it is NP-complete to find $k$ sources that minimize the stretch factor.

- **Summary**: In the beginning stage, face verification is done using easy method of geometric algorithm models, but the verification route has now developed into a scientific progress of complicated geometric representation and matching process. In modern time the skill have enhanced face detection system into the vigorous focal point. Researchers currently undergoing strong research on finding face recognition system for wider area information taken under hysterical elucidation dissimilarity. The proposed face recognition system consists of a narrative exposition indiscreet preprocessing method, a hybrid Fourier-based facial feature extraction and a score fusion scheme. We take in conventional the face detection in unlike cheer up circumstances and at unusual setting. Image processing, Image detection, Feature removal and Face detection are the methods used for Face Verification System . This paper focuses mainly on the issue of toughness to lighting variations. The proposed system has obtained an average of verification rate on Two-Dimensional images under different lightening conditions.

- **Summary**: The idea of combining multiple image modalities to provide a single, enhanced image is well established different fusion methods have been proposed in literature. This paper is based on image fusion using laplacian pyramid and wavelet transform method. Images of same size are used for experimentation. Images used for the experimentation are standard images and averaging filter is used of equal weights in original images to burl. Performance of image fusion technique is measured by mean square error, normalized absolute error and peak signal to noise ratio. From the performance analysis it has been observed that MSE is decreased in case of both the methods where as PSNR increased, NAE decreased in case of laplacian pyramid where as constant for wavelet transform method.

- **Summary**: Contour polygonal approximation is a simplified representation of a contour by line segments, so that the main characteristics of the contour remain in a small number of line segments. This paper presents a novel method for polygonal approximation based on the Complex Networks theory. We convert each point of the contour into a vertex, so that we model a regular network. Then we transform this network into a Small-World Complex Network by applying some transformations over its edges. By analyzing of network properties, especially the geodesic path, we compute the polygonal approximation. The paper presents the main characteristics of the method, as well as its functionality. We evaluate the proposed method using benchmark contours, and compare its results with other polygonal approximation methods.

- **Summary**: Motivated by an important insight from neural science, we propose a new framework for understanding the success of the recently proposed "maxout" networks. The framework is based on encoding information on sparse pathways and recognizing the correct pathway at inference time. Elaborating further on this insight, we propose a novel deep network architecture, called "channel-out" network, which takes a much better advantage of sparse pathway encoding. In channel-out networks, pathways are not only formed a posteriori, but they are also actively selected according to the inference outputs from the lower layers. From a mathematical perspective, channel-out networks can represent a wider class of piece-wise continuous functions, thereby endowing the network with more expressive power than that of maxout networks. We test our channel-out networks on several well-known image classification benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 and STL-10, which represent some of the "harder" image classification benchmarks.

- **Summary**: An important operation in geometry processing is finding the correspondences between pairs of shapes. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance, a measure of dissimilarity between metric spaces, has been found to be highly useful for nonrigid shape comparison. Here, we explore the applicability of related shape similarity measures to the problem of shape correspondence, adopting spectral type distances. We propose to evaluate the spectral kernel distance, the spectral embedding distance and the novel spectral quasi-conformal distance, comparing the manifolds from different viewpoints. By matching the shapes in the spectral domain, important attributes of surface structure are being aligned. For the purpose of testing our ideas, we introduce a fully automatic framework for finding intrinsic correspondence between two shapes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Princeton isometric shape matching protocol applied, as usual, to the TOSCA and SCAPE benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The problem of identifying the 3D pose of a known object from a given 2D image has important applications in Computer Vision. Our proposed method of registering a 3D model of a known object on a given 2D photo of the object has numerous advantages over existing methods. It does not require prior training, knowledge of the camera parameters, explicit point correspondences or matching features between the image and model. Unlike techniques that estimate a partial 3D pose (as in an overhead view of traffic or machine parts on a conveyor belt), our method estimates the complete 3D pose of the object. It works on a single static image from a given view under varying and unknown lighting conditions. For this purpose we derive a novel illumination-invariant distance measure between the 2D photo and projected 3D model, which is then minimised to find the best pose parameters. Results for vehicle pose detection in real photographs are presented.

- **Summary**: A system for live high quality surface reconstruction using a single moving depth camera on a commodity hardware is presented. High accuracy and real-time frame rate is achieved by utilizing graphics hardware computing capabilities via OpenCL and by using sparse data structure for volumetric surface representation. Depth sensor pose is estimated by combining serial texture registration algorithm with iterative closest points algorithm (ICP) aligning obtained depth map to the estimated scene model. Aligned surface is then fused into the scene. Kalman filter is used to improve fusion quality. Truncated signed distance function (TSDF) stored as block-based sparse buffer is used to represent surface. Use of sparse data structure greatly increases accuracy of scanned surfaces and maximum scanning area. Traditional GPU implementation of volumetric rendering and fusion algorithms were modified to exploit sparsity to achieve desired performance. Incorporation of texture registration for sensor pose estimation and Kalman filter for measurement integration improved accuracy and robustness of scanning process.

- **Summary**: Everyone knows that thousand of words are represented by a single image. As a result image search has become a very popular mechanism for the Web searchers. Image search means, the search results are produced by the search engine should be a set of images along with their Web page Unified Resource Locator. Now Web searcher can perform two types of image search, they are Text to Image and Image to Image search. In Text to Image search, search query should be a text. Based on the input text data system will generate a set of images along with their Web page URL as an output. On the other hand, in Image to Image search, search query should be an image and based on this image system will generate a set of images along with their Web page URL as an output. According to the current scenarios, Text to Image search mechanism always not returns perfect result. It matches the text data and then displays the corresponding images as an output, which is not always perfect. To resolve this problem, Web researchers have introduced the Image to Image search mechanism. In this paper, we have also proposed an alternate approach of Image to Image search mechanism using Histogram.

- **Summary**: We propose a supervised machine learning approach for boosting existing signal and image recovery methods and demonstrate its efficacy on example of image reconstruction in computed tomography. Our technique is based on a local nonlinear fusion of several image estimates, all obtained by applying a chosen reconstruction algorithm with different values of its control parameters. Usually such output images have different bias/variance trade-off. The fusion of the images is performed by feed-forward neural network trained on a set of known examples. Numerical experiments show an improvement in reconstruction quality relatively to existing direct and iterative reconstruction methods.

- **Summary**: To provide insight into cloth perception and manipulation with an active binocular robotic vision system, we compiled a database of 80 stereo-pair colour images with corresponding horizontal and vertical disparity maps and mask annotations, for 3D garment point cloud rendering has been created and released. The stereo-image garment database is part of research conducted under the EU-FP7 Clothes Perception and Manipulation (CloPeMa) project and belongs to a wider database collection released through CloPeMa (www.clopema.eu). This database is based on 16 different off-the-shelve garments. Each garment has been imaged in five different pose configurations on the project's binocular robot head. A full copy of the database is made available for scientific research only at https://sites.google.com/site/ugstereodatabase/.

- **Summary**: Unobtrusive every day health monitoring can be of important use for the elderly population. In particular, pupil size may be a valuable source of information, since, apart from pathological cases, it can reveal the emotional state, the fatigue and the ageing. To allow for unobtrusive monitoring to gain acceptance, one should seek for efficient methods of monitoring using com- mon low-cost hardware. This paper describes a method for monitoring pupil sizes using a common web camera in real time. Our method works by first detecting the face and the eyes area. Subsequently, optimal iris and sclera location and radius, modelled as ellipses, are found using efficient filtering. Finally, the pupil center and radius is estimated by optimal filtering within the area of the iris. Experimental result show both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Shape from texture refers to the extraction of 3D information from 2D images with irregular texture. This paper introduces a statistical framework to learn shape from texture where convex texture elements in a 2D image are represented through a point process. In a first step, the 2D image is preprocessed to generate a probability map corresponding to an estimate of the unnormalized intensity of the latent point process underlying the texture elements. The latent point process is subsequently inferred from the probability map in a non-parametric, model free manner. Finally, the 3D information is extracted from the point pattern by applying a locally scaled point process model where the local scaling function represents the deformation caused by the projection of a 3D surface onto a 2D image.

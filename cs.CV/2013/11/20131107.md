- **Summary**: Automatic recognition of signature is a challenging problem which has received much attention during recent years due to its many applications in different fields. Signature has been used for long time for verification and authentication purpose. Earlier methods were manual but nowadays they are getting digitized. This paper provides an efficient method to signature recognition using Radial Basis Function Network. The network is trained with sample images in database. Feature extraction is performed before using them for training. For testing purpose, an image is made to undergo rotation-translation-scaling correction and then given to network. The network successfully identifies the original image and gives correct output for stored database images also. The method provides recognition rate of approximately 80% for 200 samples.

- **Summary**: Curvature has received increased attention as an important alternative to length based regularization in computer vision. In contrast to length, it preserves elongated structures and fine details. Existing approaches are either inefficient, or have low angular resolution and yield results with strong block artifacts. We derive a new model for computing squared curvature based on integral geometry. The model counts responses of straight line triple cliques. The corresponding energy decomposes into submodular and supermodular pairwise potentials. We show that this energy can be efficiently minimized even for high angular resolutions using the trust region framework. Our results confirm that we obtain accurate and visually pleasing solutions without strong artifacts at reasonable run times.

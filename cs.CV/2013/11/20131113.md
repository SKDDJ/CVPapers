- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an efficient method to provide personal identification using fingerprint to get better accuracy even in noisy condition. The fingerprint matching based on the number of corresponding minutia pairings, has been in use for a long time, which is not very efficient for recognizing the low quality fingerprints. To overcome this problem, correlation technique is used. The correlation-based fingerprint verification system is capable of dealing with low quality images from which no minutiae can be extracted reliably and with fingerprints that suffer from non-uniform shape distortions, also in case of damaged and partial images. Orientation Field Methodology (OFM) has been used as a preprocessing module, and it converts the images into a field pattern based on the direction of the ridges, loops and bifurcations in the image of a fingerprint. The input image is then Cross Correlated (CC) with all the images in the cluster and the highest correlated image is taken as the output. The result gives a good recognition rate, as the proposed scheme uses Cross Correlation of Field Orientation (CCFO = OFM + CC) for fingerprint identification.

- **Summary**: Attendance Management System (AMS) can be made into smarter way by using face recognition technique, where we use a CCTV camera to be fixed at the entry point of a classroom, which automatically captures the image of the person and checks the observed image with the face database using android enhanced smart phone. It is typically used for two purposes. Firstly, marking attendance for student by comparing the face images produced recently and secondly, recognition of human who are strange to the environment i.e. an unauthorized person For verification of image, a newly emerging trend 3D Face Recognition is used which claims to provide more accuracy in matching the image databases and has an ability to recognize a subject at different view angles.

- **Summary**: In previous works, we investigated the use of local filters based on partial differential equations (PDE) to denoise one-dimensional signals through the image processing of time-frequency representations, such as the spectrogram. In this image denoising algorithms, the particularity of the image was hardly taken into account. We turn, in this paper, to study the performance of non-local filters, like Neighborhood or Yaroslavsky filters, in the same problem. We show that, for certain iterative schemes involving the Neighborhood filter, the computational time is drastically reduced with respect to Yaroslavsky or nonlinear PDE based filters, while the outputs of the filtering processes are similar. This is heuristically justified by the connection between the (fast) Neighborhood filter applied to a spectrogram and the corresponding Nonlocal Means filter (accurate) applied to the Wigner-Ville distribution of the signal. This correspondence holds only for time-frequency representations of one-dimensional signals, not to usual images, and in this sense the particularity of the image is exploited. We compare though a series of experiments on synthetic and biomedical signals the performance of local and non-local filters.

- **Summary**: Existing methods in the semantic computer vision community seem unable to deal with the explosion and richness of modern, open-source and social video content. Although sophisticated methods such as object detection or bag-of-words models have been well studied, they typically operate on low level features and ultimately suffer from either scalability issues or a lack of semantic meaning. On the other hand, video supervoxel segmentation has recently been established and applied to large scale data processing, which potentially serves as an intermediate representation to high level video semantic extraction. The supervoxels are rich decompositions of the video content: they capture object shape and motion well. However, it is not yet known if the supervoxel segmentation retains the semantics of the underlying video content. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of how well the actor and action semantics are retained in video supervoxel segmentation. Our study has human observers watching supervoxel segmentation videos and trying to discriminate both actor (human or animal) and action (one of eight everyday actions). We gather and analyze a large set of 640 human perceptions over 96 videos in 3 different supervoxel scales. Furthermore, we conduct machine recognition experiments on a feature defined on supervoxel segmentation, called supervoxel shape context, which is inspired by the higher order processes in human perception. Our ultimate findings suggest that a significant amount of semantics have been well retained in the video supervoxel segmentation and can be used for further video analysis.

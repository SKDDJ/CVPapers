- **Summary**: In this work, a new constrained hybrid variational deblurring model is developed by combining the non-convex first- and second-order total variation regularizers. Moreover, a box constraint is imposed on the proposed model to guarantee high deblurring performance. The developed constrained hybrid variational model could achieve a good balance between preserving image details and alleviating ringing artifacts. In what follows, we present the corresponding numerical solution by employing an iteratively reweighted algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of quantitative and qualitative image quality assessments.

- **Summary**: Curve evolution schemes for image segmentation based on a region based contour model allowing for junctions, vector-valued images and topology changes are introduced. Together with an a posteriori denoising in the segmented homogeneous regions this leads to a fast and efficient method for image segmentation and restoration. An uneven spread of mesh points is avoided by using the tangential degrees of freedom. Several numerical simulations on artificial test problems and on real images illustrate the performance of the method.

- **Summary**: Second layer scattering descriptors are known to provide good classification performance on natural quasi-stationary processes such as visual textures due to their sensitivity to higher order moments and continuity with respect to small deformations. In a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment we present visual textures to subjects and evaluate the predictive power of these descriptors with respect to the predictive power of simple contour energy - the first scattering layer. We are able to conclude not only that invariant second layer scattering coefficients better encode voxel activity, but also that well predicted voxels need not necessarily lie in known retinotopic regions.

- **Summary**: Learning features invariant to arbitrary transformations in the data is a requirement for any recognition system, biological or artificial. It is now widely accepted that simple cells in the primary visual cortex respond to features while the complex cells respond to features invariant to different transformations. We present a novel two-layered feedforward neural model that learns features in the first layer by spatial spherical clustering and invariance to transformations in the second layer by temporal spherical clustering. Learning occurs in an online and unsupervised manner following the Hebbian rule. When exposed to natural videos acquired by a camera mounted on a cat's head, the first and second layer neurons in our model develop simple and complex cell-like receptive field properties. The model can predict by learning lateral connections among the first layer neurons. A topographic map to their spatial features emerges by exponentially decaying the flow of activation with distance from one neuron to another in the first layer that fire in close temporal proximity, thereby minimizing the pooling length in an online manner simultaneously with feature learning.

- **Summary**: This paper attempts to find the most accurate classification method among parallelepiped, minimum distance and chain methods. Moreover, this study also challenges to find the suitable combination of bands, which can lead to better results in case combinations of bands occur. After comparing these three methods, the chain method over perform the other methods with 79% overall accuracy. Hence, it is more accurate than minimum distance with 67% and parallelepiped with 65%. On the other hand, based on bands features, and also by combining several researchers' findings, a table was created which includes the main objects on the land and the suitable combination of the bands for accurately detecting of landcover objects. During this process, it was observed that band 4 (out of 7 bands of Landsat 5TM) is the band, which can be used for increasing the accuracy of the combined bands in detecting objects on the land.

- **Summary**: Over the last decade, a number of Computational Imaging (CI) systems have been proposed for tasks such as motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and multispectral imaging. These techniques increase the amount of light reaching the sensor via multiplexing and then undo the deleterious effects of multiplexing by appropriate reconstruction algorithms. Given the widespread appeal and the considerable enthusiasm generated by these techniques, a detailed performance analysis of the benefits conferred by this approach is important.   Unfortunately, a detailed analysis of CI has proven to be a challenging problem because performance depends equally on three components: (1) the optical multiplexing, (2) the noise characteristics of the sensor, and (3) the reconstruction algorithm. A few recent papers have performed analysis taking multiplexing and noise characteristics into account. However, analysis of CI systems under state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms, most of which exploit signal prior models, has proven to be unwieldy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis framework incorporating all three components.   In order to perform this analysis, we model the signal priors using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A GMM prior confers two unique characteristics. Firstly, GMM satisfies the universal approximation property which says that any prior density function can be approximated to any fidelity using a GMM with appropriate number of mixtures. Secondly, a GMM prior lends itself to analytical tractability allowing us to derive simple expressions for the `minimum mean square error' (MMSE), which we use as a metric to characterize the performance of CI systems. We use our framework to analyze several previously proposed CI techniques, giving conclusive answer to the question: `How much performance gain is due to use of a signal prior and how much is due to multiplexing?

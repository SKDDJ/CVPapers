- **Summary**: This paper describes a technique of real time head gesture recognition system. The method includes Gaussian mixture model (GMM) accompanied by optical flow algorithm which provided us the required information regarding head movement. The proposed model can be implemented in various control system. We are also presenting the result and implementation of both mentioned method.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an image interpolation algorithm exploiting sparse representation for natural images. It involves three main steps: (a) obtaining an initial estimate of the high resolution image using linear methods like FIR filtering, (b) promoting sparsity in a selected dictionary through iterative thresholding, and (c) extracting high frequency information from the approximation to refine the initial estimate. For the sparse modeling, a shearlet dictionary is chosen to yield a multiscale directional representation. The proposed algorithm is compared to several state-of-the-art methods to assess its objective as well as subjective performance. Compared to the cubic spline interpolation method, an average PSNR gain of around 0.8 dB is observed over a dataset of 200 images.

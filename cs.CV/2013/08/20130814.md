- **Summary**: It is an important task to faithfully evaluate the perceptual quality of output images in many applications such as image compression, image restoration and multimedia streaming. A good image quality assessment (IQA) model should not only deliver high quality prediction accuracy but also be computationally efficient. The efficiency of IQA metrics is becoming particularly important due to the increasing proliferation of high-volume visual data in high-speed networks. We present a new effective and efficient IQA model, called gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD). The image gradients are sensitive to image distortions, while different local structures in a distorted image suffer different degrees of degradations. This motivates us to explore the use of global variation of gradient based local quality map for overall image quality prediction. We find that the pixel-wise gradient magnitude similarity (GMS) between the reference and distorted images combined with a novel pooling strategy the standard deviation of the GMS map can predict accurately perceptual image quality. The resulting GMSD algorithm is much faster than most state-of-the-art IQA methods, and delivers highly competitive prediction accuracy.

- **Summary**: Label assignment problems with large state spaces are important tasks especially in computer vision. Often the pairwise interaction (or smoothness prior) between labels assigned at adjacent nodes (or pixels) can be described as a function of the label difference. Exact inference in such labeling tasks is still difficult, and therefore approximate inference methods based on a linear programming (LP) relaxation are commonly used in practice. In this work we study how compact linear programs can be constructed for general piecwise linear smoothness priors. The number of unknowns is O(LK) per pairwise clique in terms of the state space size $L$ and the number of linear segments K. This compares to an O(L^2) size complexity of the standard LP relaxation if the piecewise linear structure is ignored. Our compact construction and the standard LP relaxation are equivalent and lead to the same (approximate) label assignment.

- **Summary**: The amount of audio-visual information has increased dramatically with the advent of High Speed Internet. Furthermore, technological advances in recent years in the field of information technology, have simplified the use of video data in various fields by the general public. This made it possible to store large collections of video documents into computer systems. To enable efficient use of these collections, it is necessary to develop tools to facilitate access to these documents and handling them. In this paper we propose a method for indexing and retrieval of video sequences in a video database of large dimension, based on a weighting technique to calculate the degree of membership of a concept in a video also a structuring of the data of the audio-visual (context / concept / video) and a relevance feedback mechanism.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a robust approach for text extraction and recognition from Arabic news video sequence. The text included in video sequences is an important needful for indexing and searching system. However, this text is difficult to detect and recognize because of the variability of its size, their low resolution characters and the complexity of the backgrounds. To solve these problems, we propose a system performing in two main tasks: extraction and recognition of text. Our system is tested on a varied database composed of different Arabic news programs and the obtained results are encouraging and show the merits of our approach.

- **Summary**: A new method for removing impulse noise from speech in the wavelet transform domain is proposed. The method utilizes the multiresolution property of the wavelet transform, which provides finer time resolution at the higher frequencies than the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), to effectively identify and remove impulse noise. It uses two features of speech to discriminate speech from impulse noise: one is the slow time-varying nature of speech and the other is the Lipschitz regularity of the speech components. On the basis of these features, an algorithm has been developed to identify and suppress wavelet coefficients that correspond to impulse noise. Experiment results show that the new method is able to significantly reduce impulse noise without degrading the quality of the speech signal or introducing any audible artifacts.

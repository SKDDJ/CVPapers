- **Summary**: LP relaxation-based message passing algorithms provide an effective tool for MAP inference over Probabilistic Graphical Models. However, different LP relaxations often have different objective functions and variables of differing dimensions, which presents a barrier to effective comparison and analysis. In addition, the computational complexity of LP relaxation-based methods grows quickly with the number of constraints. Reducing the number of constraints without sacrificing the quality of the solutions is thus desirable.   We propose a unified formulation under which existing MAP LP relaxations may be compared and analysed. Furthermore, we propose a new tool called Marginal Polytope Diagrams. Some properties of Marginal Polytope Diagrams are exploited such as node redundancy and edge equivalence. We show that using Marginal Polytope Diagrams allows the number of constraints to be reduced without loosening the LP relaxations. Then, using Marginal Polytope Diagrams and constraint reduction, we develop three novel message passing algorithms, and demonstrate that two of these show a significant improvement in speed over state-of-art algorithms while delivering a competitive, and sometimes higher, quality of solution.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for human pose estimation based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The pose estimation is formulated as a DNN-based regression problem towards body joints. We present a cascade of such DNN regressors which results in high precision pose estimates. The approach has the advantage of reasoning about pose in a holistic fashion and has a simple but yet powerful formulation which capitalizes on recent advances in Deep Learning. We present a detailed empirical analysis with state-of-art or better performance on four academic benchmarks of diverse real-world images.

- **Summary**: Image retrieval refers to finding relevant images from an image database for a query, which is considered difficult for the gap between low-level representation of images and high-level representation of queries. Recently further developed Deep Neural Network sheds light on automatically learning high-level image representation from raw pixels. In this paper, we proposed a multi-task DNN learned for image retrieval, which contains two parts, i.e., query-sharing layers for image representation computation and query-specific layers for relevance estimation. The weights of multi-task DNN are learned on clickthrough data by Ring Training. Experimental results on both simulated and real dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We propose an algorithm for segmenting natural images based on texture and color information, which leverages the co-sparse analysis model for image segmentation within a convex multilabel optimization framework. As a key ingredient of this method, we introduce a novel textural similarity measure, which builds upon the co-sparse representation of image patches. We propose a Bayesian approach to merge textural similarity with information about color and location. Combined with recently developed convex multilabel optimization methods this leads to an efficient algorithm for both supervised and unsupervised segmentation, which is easily parallelized on graphics hardware. The approach provides competitive results in unsupervised segmentation and outperforms state-of-the-art interactive segmentation methods on the Graz Benchmark.

- **Summary**: Blueworks - Medical Expert Diagnosis is developing an application, BWEye, to be used as an ophthalmology consultation decision support system. The implementation of this application involves several different tasks and one of them is the implementation of an ophthalmology images registration algorithm. The work reported in this document is related with the implementation of an algorithm to register images of angiography, colour retinography and redfree retinography. The implementations described were developed in the software MATLAB.   The implemented algorithm is based in the detection of the bifurcation points (y-features) of the vascular structures of the retina that usually are visible in the referred type of images. There are proposed two approaches to establish an initial set of features correspondences. The first approach is based in the maximization of the mutual information of the bifurcation regions of the features of images. The second approach is based in the characterization of each bifurcation point and in the minimization of the Euclidean distance between the descriptions of the features of the images in the descriptors space. The final set of the matching features for a pair of images is defined through the application of the RANSAC algorithm.   Although, it was not achieved the implementation of a full functional algorithm, there were made several analysis that can be important to future improvement of the current implementation.

- **Summary**: We examine the Xeon Phi, which is based on Intel's Many Integrated Cores architecture, for its suitability to run the FDK algorithm--the most commonly used algorithm to perform the 3D image reconstruction in cone-beam computed tomography. We study the challenges of efficiently parallelizing the application and means to enable sensible data sharing between threads despite the lack of a shared last level cache. Apart from parallelization, SIMD vectorization is critical for good performance on the Xeon Phi; we perform various micro-benchmarks to investigate the platform's new set of vector instructions and put a special emphasis on the newly introduced vector gather capability. We refine a previous performance model for the application and adapt it for the Xeon Phi to validate the performance of our optimized hand-written assembly implementation, as well as the performance of several different auto-vectorization approaches.

- **Summary**: Multilabel image annotation is one of the most important challenges in computer vision with many real-world applications. While existing work usually use conventional visual features for multilabel annotation, features based on Deep Neural Networks have shown potential to significantly boost performance. In this work, we propose to leverage the advantage of such features and analyze key components that lead to better performances. Specifically, we show that a significant performance gain could be obtained by combining convolutional architectures with approximate top-$k$ ranking objectives, as thye naturally fit the multilabel tagging problem. Our experiments on the NUS-WIDE dataset outperforms the conventional visual features by about 10%, obtaining the best reported performance in the literature.

- **Summary**: Estimating the body shape and posture of a dressed human subject in motion represented as a sequence of (possibly incomplete) 3D meshes is important for virtual change rooms and security. To solve this problem, statistical shape spaces encoding human body shape and posture variations are commonly used to constrain the search space for the shape estimate. In this work, we propose a novel method that uses a posture-invariant shape space to model body shape variation combined with a skeleton-based deformation to model posture variation. Our method can estimate the body shape and posture of both static scans and motion sequences of dressed human body scans. In case of motion sequences, our method takes advantage of motion cues to solve for a single body shape estimate along with a sequence of posture estimates. We apply our approach to both static scans and motion sequences and demonstrate that using our method, higher fitting accuracy is achieved than when using a variant of the popular SCAPE model as statistical model.

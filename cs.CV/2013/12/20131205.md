- **Summary**: To recognize face sketch through face photo database is a challenging task for todays researchers. Because face photo images in training set and face sketch images in testing set have different modality. Difference between two face photos of difference person is smaller than the difference between same person in a face photo and face sketched. In this paper, for reduction of the modality between face photo and face sketch we first bring face photo and face sketch images in a new dimension using 2D Discrete Haar wavelet transform with scale 3 followed by a negative approach. After that, extract features from transformed images using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Thereafter, we use SVM classifier and K-NN classifier for better classification. Our proposed method is experimentally verified by its robustness against faces that are captured in a good lighting condition and in a frontal pose. The experiment has been conducted with 100 male and female face images as training set and 100 male and female face sketch images as testing set collected from CUHK training and testing cropped photos and CUHK training and testing cropped sketches.

- **Summary**: An image fusion method based on salient features is proposed in this paper. In this work, we have concentrated on salient features of the image for fusion in order to preserve all relevant information contained in the input images and tried to enhance the contrast in fused image and also suppressed noise to a maximum extent. In our system, first we have applied a mask on two input images in order to conserve the high frequency information along with some low frequency information and stifle noise to a maximum extent. Thereafter, for identification of salience features from sources images, a local moment is computed in the neighborhood of a coefficient. Finally, a decision map is generated based on local moment in order to get the fused image. To verify our proposed algorithm, we have tested it on 120 sensor image pairs collected from Manchester University UK database. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide superior fused image in terms of several quantitative fusion evaluation index.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel facial sketch image or face-sketch recognition approach based on facial feature extraction. To recognize a face-sketch, we have concentrated on a set of geometric face features like eyes, nose, eyebrows, lips, etc and their length and width ratio because it is difficult to match photos and sketches because they belong to two different modalities. In this system, first the facial features/components from training images are extracted, then ratios of length, width, and area etc. are calculated and those are stored as feature vectors for individual images. After that the mean feature vectors are computed and subtracted from each feature vector for centering of the feature vectors. In the next phase, feature vector for the incoming probe face-sketch is also computed in similar fashion. Here, K-NN classifier is used to recognize probe face-sketch. It is experimentally verified that the proposed method is robust against faces are in a frontal pose, with normal lighting and neutral expression and have no occlusions. The experiment has been conducted with 80 male and female face images from different face databases. It has useful applications for both law enforcement and digital entertainment.

- **Summary**: Preprocessing a 2D image often produces a noisy cloud of interest points. We study the problem of counting holes in unorganized clouds in the plane. The holes in a given cloud are quantified by the topological persistence of their boundary contours when the cloud is analyzed at all possible scales. We design the algorithm to count holes that are most persistent in the filtration of offsets (neighborhoods) around given points. The input is a cloud of $n$ points in the plane without any user-defined parameters. The algorithm has $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space. The output is the array (number of holes, relative persistence in the filtration). We prove theoretical guarantees when the algorithm finds the correct number of holes (components in the complement) of an unknown shape approximated by a cloud.

- **Summary**: The Vietoris-Rips filtration for an $n$-point metric space is a sequence of large simplicial complexes adding a topological structure to the otherwise disconnected space. The persistent homology is a key tool in topological data analysis and studies topological features of data that persist over many scales. The fastest algorithm for computing persistent homology of a filtration has time $O(M(u)+u^2\log^2 u)$, where $u$ is the number of updates (additions or deletions of simplices), $M(u)=O(u^{2.376})$ is the time for multiplication of $u\times u$ matrices. For a space of $n$ points given by their pairwise distances, we approximate the Vietoris-Rips filtration by a zigzag filtration consisting of $u=o(n)$ updates, which is sublinear in $n$. The constant depends on a given error of approximation and on the doubling dimension of the metric space. Then the persistent homology of this sublinear-size filtration can be computed in time $o(n^2)$, which is subquadratic in $n$.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a technique for automatic face recognition using integrated multiple feature sets extracted from the significant blocks of a gradient image. We discuss about the use of novel morphological, local directional pattern (LDP) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix GLCM based feature extraction technique to recognize human faces. Firstly, the new morphological features i.e., features based on number of runs of pixels in four directions (N,NE,E,NW) are extracted, together with the GLCM based statistical features and LDP features that are less sensitive to the noise and non-monotonic illumination changes, are extracted from the significant blocks of the gradient image. Then these features are concatenated together. We integrate the above mentioned methods to take full advantage of the three approaches. Extraction of the significant blocks from the absolute gradient image and hence from the original image to extract pertinent information with the idea of dimension reduction forms the basis of the work. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated by the experiment on 1100 images from the FRAV2D face database, 2200 images from the FERET database, where the images vary in pose, expression, illumination and scale and 400 images from the ORL face database, where the images slightly vary in pose. Our method has shown 90.3%, 93% and 98.75% recognition accuracy for the FRAV2D, FERET and the ORL database respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new technique for automatic face recognition using integrated peaks of the Hough transformed significant blocks of the binary gradient image. In this approach firstly the gradient of an image is calculated and a threshold is set to obtain a binary gradient image, which is less sensitive to noise and illumination changes. Secondly, significant blocks are extracted from the absolute gradient image, to extract pertinent information with the idea of dimension reduction. Finally the best fitted Hough peaks are extracted from the Hough transformed significant blocks for efficient face recognition. Then these Hough peaks are concatenated together, which are used as feature in classification process. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experiment on 1100 images from the FRAV2D face database, 2200 images from the FERET database, where the images vary in pose, expression, illumination and scale and 400 images from the ORL face database, where the images slightly vary in pose. Our method has shown 93.3%, 88.5% and 99% recognition accuracy for the FRAV2D, FERET and the ORL database respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper a nonlinear Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) discriminant feature extraction approach for enhanced face recognition is proposed. Firstly, the low-energized blocks from Gabor wavelet transformed images are extracted. Secondly, the nonlinear discriminating features are analyzed and extracted from the selected low-energized blocks by the generalized Kernel Discriminative Common Vector (KDCV) method. The KDCV method is extended to include cosine kernel function in the discriminating method. The KDCV with the cosine kernels is then applied on the extracted low energized discriminating feature vectors to obtain the real component of a complex quantity for face recognition. In order to derive positive kernel discriminative vectors; we apply only those kernel discriminative eigenvectors that are associated with non-zero eigenvalues. The feasibility of the low energized Gabor block based generalized KDCV method with cosine kernel function models has been successfully tested for image classification using the L1, L2 distance measures; and the cosine similarity measure on both frontal and pose-angled face recognition. Experimental results on the FRAV2D and the FERET database demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel methodology that combines the multi-resolution feature of the Gabor wavelet transformation (GWT) with the local interactions of the facial structures expressed through the Pseudo Hidden Markov model (PHMM). Unlike the traditional zigzag scanning method for feature extraction a continuous scanning method from top-left corner to right then top-down and right to left and so on until right-bottom of the image i.e. a spiral scanning technique has been proposed for better feature selection. Unlike traditional HMMs, the proposed PHMM does not perform the state conditional independence of the visible observation sequence assumption. This is achieved via the concept of local structures introduced by the PHMM used to extract facial bands and automatically select the most informative features of a face image. Thus, the long-range dependency problem inherent to traditional HMMs has been drastically reduced. Again with the use of most informative pixels rather than the whole image makes the proposed method reasonably faster for face recognition. This method has been successfully tested on frontal face images from the ORL, FRAV2D and FERET face databases where the images vary in pose, illumination, expression, and scale. The FERET data set contains 2200 frontal face images of 200 subjects, while the FRAV2D data set consists of 1100 images of 100 subjects and the full ORL database is considered. The results reported in this application are far better than the recent and most referred systems.

- **Summary**: This paper exploits the feature extraction capabilities of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) together with an illumination normalization approach in the logarithm domain that increase its robustness to variations in facial geometry and illumination. Secondly in the same domain the entropy measures are applied on the DCT coefficients so that maximum entropy preserving pixels can be extracted as the feature vector. Thus the informative features of a face can be extracted in a low dimensional space. Finally, the kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) with an extension of arc cosine kernels is applied on the extracted DCT coefficients that contribute most to the entropy estimate to obtain only those real kernel ECA eigenvectors that are associated with eigenvalues having high positive entropy contribution. The resulting system was successfully tested on real image sequences and is robust to significant partial occlusion and illumination changes, validated with the experiments on the FERET, AR, FRAV2D and ORL face databases. Experimental comparison is demonstrated to prove the superiority of the proposed approach in respect to recognition accuracy. Using specificity and sensitivity we find that the best is achieved when Renyi entropy is applied on the DCT coefficients. Extensive experimental comparison is demonstrated to prove the superiority of the proposed approach in respect to recognition accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach is very simple, computationally fast and can be implemented in any real-time face recognition system.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel Gabor wavelet based Kernel Entropy Component Analysis (KECA) method by integrating the Gabor wavelet transformation (GWT) of facial images with the KECA method for enhanced face recognition performance. Firstly, from the Gabor wavelet transformed images the most important discriminative desirable facial features characterized by spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation selectivity to cope with the variations due to illumination and facial expression changes were derived. After that KECA, relating to the Renyi entropy is extended to include cosine kernel function. The KECA with the cosine kernels is then applied on the extracted most important discriminating feature vectors of facial images to obtain only those real kernel ECA eigenvectors that are associated with eigenvalues having positive entropy contribution. Finally, these real KECA features are used for image classification using the L1, L2 distance measures; the Mahalanobis distance measure and the cosine similarity measure. The feasibility of the Gabor based KECA method with the cosine kernel has been successfully tested on both frontal and pose-angled face recognition, using datasets from the ORL, FRAV2D and the FERET database.

- **Summary**: Let $X$ be a simplicial complex with a piecewise linear function $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$. The Reeb graph $Reeb(f,X)$ is the quotient of $X$, where we collapse each connected component of $f^{-1}(t)$ to a single point. Let the nodes of $Reeb(f,X)$ be all homologically critical points where any homology of the corresponding component of the level set $f^{-1}(t)$ changes. Then we can label every arc of $Reeb(f,X)$ with the Betti numbers $(\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots,\beta_d)$ of the corresponding $d$-dimensional component of a level set. The homology labels give more information about the original complex $X$ than the classical Reeb graph. We describe a canonical embedding of a Reeb graph into a multi-page book (a star cross a line) and give a unique linear code of this book embedding.

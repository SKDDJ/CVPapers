- **Summary**: In identity management system, frequently used biometric recognition system needs awareness towards issue of protecting biometric template as far as more reliable solution is apprehensive. In sight of this biometric template protection algorithm should gratify the basic requirements viz. security, discriminability and cancelability. As no single template protection method is capable of satisfying these requirements, a novel scheme for face template generation and protection is proposed. The novel scheme is proposed to provide security and accuracy in new user enrolment and authentication process. This novel scheme takes advantage of both the hybrid approach and the binary discriminant analysis algorithm. This algorithm is designed on the basis of random projection, binary discriminant analysis and fuzzy commitment scheme. Publicly available benchmark face databases (FERET, FRGC, CMU-PIE) and other datasets are used for evaluation. The proposed novel scheme enhances the discriminability and recognition accuracy in terms of matching score of the face images for each stage and provides high security against potential attacks namely brute force and smart attacks. In this paper, we discuss results viz. averages matching score, computation time and security for hybrid approach and novel approach.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach to learn the formulae characterising the emergent behaviour of a dynamical system from system observations. At a high level, the approach starts by devising a statistical dynamical model of the system which optimally fits the observations. We then propose general optimisation strategies for selecting high support formulae (under the learnt model of the system) either within a discrete set of formulae of bounded complexity, or a parametric family of formulae. We illustrate and apply the methodology on an in-depth case study of characterising cardiac malfunction from electro-cardiogram data, where our approach enables us to quantitatively determine the diagnostic power of a formula in discriminating between different cardiac conditions.

- **Summary**: The appearance and structure of blood vessels in retinal images have an important role in diagnosis of diseases. This paper proposes a method for automatic retinal vessel segmentation. In this work, a novel preprocessing based on local histogram equalization is used to enhance the original image then pixels are classified as vessel and non-vessel using a classifier. For this classification, special feature vectors are organized based on responses to Morlet wavelet. Morlet wavelet is a continues transform which has the ability to filter existing noises after preprocessing. Bayesian classifier is used and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is its likelihood function. The probability distributions are approximated according to training set of manual that has been segmented by a specialist. After this, morphological transforms are used in different directions to make the existing discontinuities uniform on the DRIVE database, it achieves the accuracy about 0.9571 which shows that it is an accurate method among the available ones for retinal vessel segmentation.

- **Summary**: The computer industry is developing at a fast pace. With this development almost all of the fields under computers have advanced in the past couple of decades. But the same technology is being used for human computer interaction that was used in 1970s. Even today the same type of keyboard and mouse is used for interacting with computer systems. With the recent boom in the mobile segment touchscreens have become popular for interaction with cell phones. But these touchscreens are rarely used on traditional systems. This paper tries to introduce methods for human computer interaction using the users hand which can be used both on traditional computer platforms as well as cell phones. The methods explain how the users detected hand can be used as input for applications and also explain applications that can take advantage of this type of interaction mechanism.

- **Summary**: Systems based on bag-of-words models from image features collected at maxima of sparse interest point operators have been used successfully for both computer visual object and action recognition tasks. While the sparse, interest-point based approach to recognition is not inconsistent with visual processing in biological systems that operate in `saccade and fixate' regimes, the methodology and emphasis in the human and the computer vision communities remains sharply distinct. Here, we make three contributions aiming to bridge this gap. First, we complement existing state-of-the art large scale dynamic computer vision annotated datasets like Hollywood-2 and UCF Sports with human eye movements collected under the ecological constraints of the visual action recognition task. To our knowledge these are the first large human eye tracking datasets to be collected and made publicly available for video, vision.imar.ro/eyetracking (497,107 frames, each viewed by 16 subjects), unique in terms of their (a) large scale and computer vision relevance, (b) dynamic, video stimuli, (c) task control, as opposed to free-viewing. Second, we introduce novel sequential consistency and alignment measures, which underline the remarkable stability of patterns of visual search among subjects. Third, we leverage the significant amount of collected data in order to pursue studies and build automatic, end-to-end trainable computer vision systems based on human eye movements. Our studies not only shed light on the differences between computer vision spatio-temporal interest point image sampling strategies and the human fixations, as well as their impact for visual recognition performance, but also demonstrate that human fixations can be accurately predicted, and when used in an end-to-end automatic system, leveraging some of the advanced computer vision practice, can lead to state of the art results.

- **Summary**: The brain tumor segmentation on MRI images is a very difficult and important task which is used in surgical and medical planning and assessments. If experts do the segmentation manually with their own medical knowledge, it will be time-consuming. Therefore, researchers propose methods and systems which can do the segmentation automatically and without any interference. In this article, an unsupervised automatic method for brain tumor segmentation on MRI images is presented. In this method, at first in the pre-processing level, the extra parts which are outside the skull and don't have any helpful information are removed and then anisotropic diffusion filter with 8-connected neighborhood is applied to the MRI images to remove noise. By applying the fast bounding box(FBB) algorithm, the tumor area is displayed on the MRI image with a bounding box and the central part is selected as sample points for training of a One Class SVM classifier. A database is also provided by the Zanjan MRI Center. The MRI images are related to 10 patients who have brain tumor. 100 T2-weighted MRI images are used in this study. Experimental results show the high precision and dependability of the proposed algorithm. The results are also highly helpful for specialists and radiologists to easily estimate the size and position of a tumor.

- **Summary**: As large amount of visual Information is available on web in form of images, graphics, animations and videos, so it is important in internet era to have an effective video search system. As there are number of video search engine (blinkx, Videosurf, Google, YouTube, etc.) which search for relevant videos based on user keyword or term, But very less commercial video search engine are available which search videos based on visual image/clip/video. In this paper we are recommending a system that will search for relevant video using color feature of video in response of user Query.

- **Summary**: The least-square regression problems or inverse problems have been widely studied in many fields such as compressive sensing, signal processing, and image processing. To solve this kind of ill-posed problems, a regularization term (i.e., regularizer) should be introduced, under the assumption that the solutions have some specific properties, such as sparsity and group sparsity. Widely used regularizers include the $\ell_1$ norm, total variation (TV) semi-norm, and so on.   Recently, a new regularization term with overlapping group sparsity has been considered. Majorization minimization iteration method or variable duplication methods are often applied to solve them. However, there have been no direct methods for solve the relevant problems because of the difficulty of overlapping. In this paper, we proposed new explicit shrinkage formulas for one class of these relevant problems, whose regularization terms have translation invariant overlapping groups. Moreover, we apply our results in TV deblurring and denoising with overlapping group sparsity. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to iterate solve it. Numerical results also verify the validity and effectiveness of our new explicit shrinkage formulas.

- **Summary**: The task of detecting the interest points in 3D meshes has typically been handled by geometric methods. These methods, while greatly describing human preference, can be ill-equipped for handling the variety and subjectivity in human responses. Different tasks have different requirements for interest point detection; some tasks may necessitate high precision while other tasks may require high recall. Sometimes points with high curvature may be desirable, while in other cases high curvature may be an indication of noise. Geometric methods lack the required flexibility to adapt to such changes. As a consequence, interest point detection seems to be well suited for machine learning methods that can be trained to match the criteria applied on the annotated training data. In this paper, we formulate interest point detection as a supervised binary classification problem using a random forest as our classifier. Among other challenges, we are faced with an imbalanced learning problem due to the substantial difference in the priors between interest and non-interest points. We address this by re-sampling the training set. We validate the accuracy of our method and compare our results to those of five state of the art methods on a new, standard benchmark.

- **Summary**: Speech representation and modelling in high-dimensional spaces of acoustic waveforms, or a linear transformation thereof, is investigated with the aim of improving the robustness of automatic speech recognition to additive noise. The motivation behind this approach is twofold: (i) the information in acoustic waveforms that is usually removed in the process of extracting low-dimensional features might aid robust recognition by virtue of structured redundancy analogous to channel coding, (ii) linear feature domains allow for exact noise adaptation, as opposed to representations that involve non-linear processing which makes noise adaptation challenging. Thus, we develop a generative framework for phoneme modelling in high-dimensional linear feature domains, and use it in phoneme classification and recognition tasks. Results show that classification and recognition in this framework perform better than analogous PLP and MFCC classifiers below 18 dB SNR. A combination of the high-dimensional and MFCC features at the likelihood level performs uniformly better than either of the individual representations across all noise levels.

- **Summary**: We investigate the use of deep neural networks for the novel task of class generic object detection. We show that neural networks originally designed for image recognition can be trained to detect objects within images, regardless of their class, including objects for which no bounding box labels have been provided. In addition, we show that bounding box labels yield a 1% performance increase on the ImageNet recognition challenge.

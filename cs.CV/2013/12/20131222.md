- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new pattern of two dimensional cellular automata linear rules that are used for efficient edge detection of an image. Since cellular automata is inherently parallel in nature, it has produced desired output within a unit time interval. We have observed four linear rules among 512 total linear rules of a rectangular cellular automata in adiabatic or reflexive boundary condition that produces an optimal result. These four rules are directly applied once to the images and produced edge detected output. We compare our results with the existing edge detection algorithms and found that our results shows better edge detection with an enhancement of edges.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel node splitting method for regression trees and incorporate it into the regression forest framework. Unlike traditional binary splitting, where the splitting rule is selected from a predefined set of binary splitting rules via trial-and-error, the proposed node splitting method first finds clusters of the training data which at least locally minimize the empirical loss without considering the input space. Then splitting rules which preserve the found clusters as much as possible are determined by casting the problem into a classification problem. Consequently, our new node splitting method enjoys more freedom in choosing the splitting rules, resulting in more efficient tree structures. In addition to the Euclidean target space, we present a variant which can naturally deal with a circular target space by the proper use of circular statistics. We apply the regression forest employing our node splitting to head pose estimation (Euclidean target space) and car direction estimation (circular target space) and demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (38.5% and 22.5% error reduction respectively).

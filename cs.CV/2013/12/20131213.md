- **Summary**: ARIANNA stands for pAth Recognition for Indoor Assisted Navigation with Augmented perception. It is a flexible and low cost navigation system for vi- sually impaired people. Arianna permits to navigate colored paths painted or sticked on the floor revealing their directions through vibrational feedback on commercial smartphones.

- **Summary**: In this paper we have tried to compare the various face recognition models against their classical problems. We look at the methods followed by these approaches and evaluate to what extent they are able to solve the problems. All methods proposed have some drawbacks under certain conditions. To overcome these drawbacks we propose a multi-model approach

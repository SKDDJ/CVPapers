- **Summary**: We develop a generalized active contour formalism for image segmentation based on shape templates. The shape template is subjected to a restricted affine transformation (RAT) in order to segment the object of interest. RAT allows for translation, rotation, and scaling, which give a total of five degrees of freedom. The proposed active contour comprises an inner and outer contour pair, which are closed and concentric. The active contour energy is a contrast function defined based on the intensities of pixels that lie inside the inner contour and those that lie in the annulus between the inner and outer contours. We show that the contrast energy functional is optimal under certain conditions. The optimal RAT parameters are computed by maximizing the contrast function using a gradient descent optimizer. We show that the calculations are made efficient through use of Green's theorem. The proposed formalism is capable of handling a variety of shapes because for a chosen template, optimization is carried with respect to the RAT parameters only. The proposed formalism is validated on multiple images to show robustness to Gaussian and Poisson noise, to initialization, and to partial loss of structure in the object to be segmented.

- **Summary**: We present a compact formula for the derivative of a 3-D rotation matrix with respect to its exponential coordinates. A geometric interpretation of the resulting expression is provided, as well as its agreement with other less-compact but better-known formulas. To the best of our knowledge, this simpler formula does not appear anywhere in the literature. We hope by providing this more compact expression to alleviate the common pressure to reluctantly resort to alternative representations in various computational applications simply as a means to avoid the complexity of differential analysis in exponential coordinates.

- **Summary**: Blood related invasive pathological investigations play a major role in diagnosis of diseases. But in India and other third world countries there are no enough pathological infrastructures for medical diagnosis. Moreover, most of the remote places of those countries have neither pathologists nor physicians. Telemedicine partially solves the lack of physicians. But the pathological investigation infrastructure can not be integrated with the telemedicine technology. The objective of this work is to automate the blood related pathological investigation process. Detection of different white blood cells has been automated in this work. This system can be deployed in the remote area as a supporting aid for telemedicine technology and only high school education is sufficient to operate it. The proposed system achieved 97.33 percent accuracy for the samples collected to test this system.

- **Summary**: The analysis and counting of blood cells in a microscope image can provide useful information concerning to the health of a person. In particular, morphological analysis of red blood cells deformations can effectively detect important disease like malaria. Blood images, obtained by the microscope, which is coupled with a digital camera, are analyzed by the computer for diagnosis or can be transmitted easily to clinical centers than liquid blood samples. Automatic analysis system for the presence of Plasmodium in microscopic image of blood can greatly help pathologists and doctors that typically inspect blood films manually. Unfortunately, the analysis made by human experts is not rapid and not yet standardized due to the operators capabilities and tiredness. The paper shows how effectively and accurately it is possible to identify the Plasmodium in the blood film. In particular, the paper presents how to enhance the microscopic image and filter out the unnecessary segments followed by the threshold based segmentation and recognize the presence of Plasmodium. The proposed system can be deployed in the remote area as a supporting aid for telemedicine technology and only basic training is sufficient to operate it. This system achieved more than 98 percentage accuracy for the samples collected to test this system.

- **Summary**: Methods have been used for identification of human by recognizing lip prints. Human lips have a number of elevation and depressions features called lip prints and examination of lip prints is referred to as cheiloscopy. Lip prints of each human being are unique in nature like many others features of human. In this paper lip print is first smoothened using a Gaussian Filter. Next Sobel Edge Detector and Canny Edge Detector are used to detect the vertical and horizontal groove pattern in the lip. This method of identification will be useful both in criminal forensics and personal identification. It is our assumption that study of lip prints and their types are well connected to play a song in a better way that are well accepted to people who loves to hear songs.

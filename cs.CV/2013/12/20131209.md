- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to monitor oil spills are some methods that have been proposed for the West African sub-region. With the increase in the number of oil exploration companies in Ghana (and her neighbors) and the rise in the coastal activities in the sub-region, there is the need for proper monitoring of the environmental impact of these socio-economic activities on the environment. Detection and near real-time information about oil spills are fundamental in reducing oil spill environmental impact. SAR images are prone to some noise, which is predominantly speckle noise around the coastal areas. This paper evaluates the performance of the mean and median filters used in the preprocessing filtering to reduce speckle noise in SAR images for most image processing algorithms.

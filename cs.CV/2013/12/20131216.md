- **Summary**: Teleoperation is necessary when the robot is applied to real missions, for example surveillance, search and rescue. We proposed teleoperation system using past image records (SPIR). SPIR virtually generates the bird's-eye view image by overlaying the CG model of the robot at the corresponding current position on the background image which is captured from the camera mounted on the robot at a past time. The problem for SPIR is that the communication bandwidth is often narrow in some teleoperation tasks. In this case, the candidates of background image of SPIR are few and the position of the robot is often delayed. In this study, we propose zoom function for insufficiency of candidates of the background image and additional interpolation lines for the delay of the position data of the robot. To evaluate proposed system, an outdoor experiments are carried out. The outdoor experiment is conducted on a training course of a driving school.

- **Summary**: We propose a number of variational regularisation methods for the estimation and decomposition of motion fields on the $2$-sphere. While motion estimation is based on the optical flow equation, the presented decomposition models are motivated by recent trends in image analysis. In particular we treat $u+v$ decomposition as well as hierarchical decomposition. Helmholtz decomposition of motion fields is obtained as a natural by-product of the chosen numerical method based on vector spherical harmonics. All models are tested on time-lapse microscopy data depicting fluorescently labelled endodermal cells of a zebrafish embryo.

- **Summary**: We attack the problem of learning concepts automatically from noisy web image search results. Going beyond low level attributes, such as colour and texture, we explore weakly-labelled datasets for the learning of higher level concepts, such as scene categories. The idea is based on discovering common characteristics shared among subsets of images by posing a method that is able to organise the data while eliminating irrelevant instances. We propose a novel clustering and outlier detection method, namely Rectifying Self Organizing Maps (RSOM). Given an image collection returned for a concept query, RSOM provides clusters pruned from outliers. Each cluster is used to train a model representing a different characteristics of the concept. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art studies on the task of learning low-level concepts, and it is competitive in learning higher level concepts as well. It is capable to work at large scale with no supervision through exploiting the available sources.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.

- **Summary**: Tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is an important but time consuming manual task performed by medical experts. Automating this process is a challenging task because of the high diversity in the appearance of tumor tissues among different patients and in many cases similarity with the normal tissues. MRI is an advanced medical imaging technique providing rich information about the human soft-tissue anatomy. There are different brain tumor detection and segmentation methods to detect and segment a brain tumor from MRI images. These detection and segmentation approaches are reviewed with an importance placed on enlightening the advantages and drawbacks of these methods for brain tumor detection and segmentation. The use of MRI image detection and segmentation in different procedures are also described. Here a brief review of different segmentation for detection of brain tumor from MRI of brain has been discussed.

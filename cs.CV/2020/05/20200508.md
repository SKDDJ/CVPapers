- **Summary**: Mass utilization of body-worn cameras has led to a huge corpus of available egocentric video. Existing video summarization algorithms can accelerate browsing such videos by selecting (visually) interesting shots from them. Nonetheless, since the system user still has to watch the summary videos, browsing large video databases remain a challenge. Hence, in this work, we propose to generate a textual synopsis, consisting of a few sentences describing the most important events in a long egocentric videos. Users can read the short text to gain insight about the video, and more importantly, efficiently search through the content of a large video database using text queries. Since egocentric videos are long and contain many activities and events, using video-to-text algorithms results in thousands of descriptions, many of which are incorrect. Therefore, we propose a multi-task learning scheme to simultaneously generate descriptions for video segments and summarize the resulting descriptions in an end-to-end fashion. We Input a set of video shots and the network generates a text description for each shot. Next, visual-language content matching unit that is trained with a weakly supervised objective, identifies the correct descriptions. Finally, the last component of our network, called purport network, evaluates the descriptions all together to select the ones containing crucial information. Out of thousands of descriptions generated for the video, a few informative sentences are returned to the user. We validate our framework on the challenging UT Egocentric video dataset, where each video is between 3 to 5 hours long, associated with over 3000 textual descriptions on average. The generated textual summaries, including only 5 percent (or less) of the generated descriptions, are compared to groundtruth summaries in text domain using well-established metrics in natural language processing.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has revolutionized object detection thanks to large-scale datasets, but their object categories are still arguably very limited. In this paper, we attempt to enrich such categories by addressing the one-shot object detection problem, where the number of annotated training examples for learning an unseen class is limited to one. We introduce a two-stage model consisting of a first stage Matching-FCOS network and a second stage Structure-Aware Relation Module, the combination of which integrates metric learning with an anchor-free Faster R-CNN-style detection pipeline, eventually eliminating the need to fine-tune on the support images. We also propose novel training strategies that effectively improve detection performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations were performed and our method exceeds the state-of-the-art one-shot performance consistently on multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: We investigate a new method for injecting backdoors into machine learning models, based on compromising the loss-value computation in the model-training code. We use it to demonstrate new classes of backdoors strictly more powerful than those in the prior literature: single-pixel and physical backdoors in ImageNet models, backdoors that switch the model to a covert, privacy-violating task, and backdoors that do not require inference-time input modifications.   Our attack is blind: the attacker cannot modify the training data, nor observe the execution of his code, nor access the resulting model. The attack code creates poisoned training inputs "on the fly," as the model is training, and uses multi-objective optimization to achieve high accuracy on both the main and backdoor tasks. We show how a blind attack can evade any known defense and propose new ones.

- **Summary**: Over the last decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the leading algorithms in image classification and segmentation. Recent publication of large medical imaging databases have accelerated their use in the biomedical arena. While training data for photograph classification benefits from aggressive geometric augmentation, medical diagnosis -- especially in chest radiographs -- depends more strongly on feature location. Diagnosis classification results may be artificially enhanced by reliance on radiographic annotations. This work introduces a general pre-processing step for chest x-ray input into machine learning algorithms. A modified Y-Net architecture based on the VGG11 encoder is used to simultaneously learn geometric orientation (similarity transform parameters) of the chest and segmentation of radiographic annotations. Chest x-rays were obtained from published databases. The algorithm was trained with 1000 manually labeled images with augmentation. Results were evaluated by expert clinicians, with acceptable geometry in 95.8% and annotation mask in 96.2% (n=500), compared to 27.0% and 34.9% respectively in control images (n=241). We hypothesize that this pre-processing step will improve robustness in future diagnostic algorithms.

- **Summary**: Understanding chest CT imaging of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression. Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Generating adversarial examples in a black-box setting retains a significant challenge with vast practical application prospects. In particular, existing black-box attacks suffer from the need for excessive queries, as it is non-trivial to find an appropriate direction to optimize in the high-dimensional space. In this paper, we propose Projection & Probability-driven Black-box Attack (PPBA) to tackle this problem by reducing the solution space and providing better optimization. For reducing the solution space, we first model the adversarial perturbation optimization problem as a process of recovering frequency-sparse perturbations with compressed sensing, under the setting that random noise in the low-frequency space is more likely to be adversarial. We then propose a simple method to construct a low-frequency constrained sensing matrix, which works as a plug-and-play projection matrix to reduce the dimensionality. Such a sensing matrix is shown to be flexible enough to be integrated into existing methods like NES and Bandits$_{TD}$. For better optimization, we perform a random walk with a probability-driven strategy, which utilizes all queries over the whole progress to make full use of the sensing matrix for a less query budget. Extensive experiments show that our method requires at most 24% fewer queries with a higher attack success rate compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the attack method is evaluated on the real-world online service, i.e., Google Cloud Vision API, which further demonstrates our practical potentials.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving system development is critically dependent on the ability to replay complex and diverse traffic scenarios in simulation. In such scenarios, the ability to accurately simulate the vehicle sensors such as cameras, lidar or radar is essential. However, current sensor simulators leverage gaming engines such as Unreal or Unity, requiring manual creation of environments, objects and material properties. Such approaches have limited scalability and fail to produce realistic approximations of camera, lidar, and radar data without significant additional work.   In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach to generate realistic scenario sensor data, based only on a limited amount of lidar and camera data collected by an autonomous vehicle. Our approach uses texture-mapped surfels to efficiently reconstruct the scene from an initial vehicle pass or set of passes, preserving rich information about object 3D geometry and appearance, as well as the scene conditions. We then leverage a SurfelGAN network to reconstruct realistic camera images for novel positions and orientations of the self-driving vehicle and moving objects in the scene. We demonstrate our approach on the Waymo Open Dataset and show that it can synthesize realistic camera data for simulated scenarios. We also create a novel dataset that contains cases in which two self-driving vehicles observe the same scene at the same time. We use this dataset to provide additional evaluation and demonstrate the usefulness of our SurfelGAN model.

- **Summary**: Lip reading has received increasing attention in recent years. This paper focuses on the synergy of multilingual lip reading. There are about as many as 7000 languages in the world, which implies that it is impractical to train separate lip reading models with large-scale data for each language. Although each language has its own linguistic and pronunciation rules, the lip movements of all languages share similar patterns due to the common structures of human organs. Based on this idea, we try to explore the synergized learning of multilingual lip reading in this paper, and further propose a synchronous bidirectional learning (SBL) framework for effective synergy of multilingual lip reading. We firstly introduce phonemes as our modeling units for the multilingual setting here. Phonemes are more closely related with the lip movements than the alphabet letters. At the same time, similar phonemes always lead to similar visual patterns no matter which type the target language is. Then, a novel SBL block is proposed to learn the rules for each language in a fill-in-the-blank way. Specifically, the model has to learn to infer the target unit given its bidirectional context, which could represent the composition rules of phonemes for each language. To make the learning process more targeted at each particular language, an extra task of predicting the language identity is introduced in the learning process. Finally, a thorough comparison on LRW (English) and LRW-1000 (Mandarin) is performed, which shows the promising benefits from the synergized learning of different languages and also reports a new state-of-the-art result on both datasets.



### Where am I looking at? Joint Location and Orientation Estimation by Cross-View Matching

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization is the problem of estimating the position and orientation (latitude, longitude and azimuth angle) of a camera at ground level given a large-scale database of geo-tagged aerial (e.g., satellite) images. Existing approaches treat the task as a pure location estimation problem by learning discriminative feature descriptors, but neglect orientation alignment. It is well-recognized that knowing the orientation between ground and aerial images can significantly reduce matching ambiguity between these two views, especially when the ground-level images have a limited Field of View (FoV) instead of a full field-of-view panorama. Therefore, we design a Dynamic Similarity Matching network to estimate cross-view orientation alignment during localization. In particular, we address the cross-view domain gap by applying a polar transform to the aerial images to approximately align the images up to an unknown azimuth angle. Then, a two-stream convolutional network is used to learn deep features from the ground and polar-transformed aerial images. Finally, we obtain the orientation by computing the correlation between cross-view features, which also provides a more accurate measure of feature similarity, improving location recall. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, we improve the top-1 location recall rate on the CVUSA dataset by a factor of 1.5x for panoramas with known orientation, by a factor of 3.3x for panoramas with unknown orientation, and by a factor of 6x for 180-degree FoV images with unknown orientation.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims to infer the complete geometries for missing regions of 3D objects from incomplete ones. Previous methods usually predict the complete point cloud based on the global shape representation extracted from the incomplete input. However, the global representation often suffers from the information loss of structure details on local regions of incomplete point cloud. To address this problem, we propose Skip-Attention Network (SA-Net) for 3D point cloud completion. Our main contributions lie in the following two-folds. First, we propose a skip-attention mechanism to effectively exploit the local structure details of incomplete point clouds during the inference of missing parts. The skip-attention mechanism selectively conveys geometric information from the local regions of incomplete point clouds for the generation of complete ones at different resolutions, where the skip-attention reveals the completion process in an interpretable way. Second, in order to fully utilize the selected geometric information encoded by skip-attention mechanism at different resolutions, we propose a novel structure-preserving decoder with hierarchical folding for complete shape generation. The hierarchical folding preserves the structure of complete point cloud generated in upper layer by progressively detailing the local regions, using the skip-attentioned geometry at the same resolution. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ShapeNet and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed SA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.

- **Summary**: We present the second edition of OpenEDS dataset, OpenEDS2020, a novel dataset of eye-image sequences captured at a frame rate of 100 Hz under controlled illumination, using a virtual-reality head-mounted display mounted with two synchronized eye-facing cameras. The dataset, which is anonymized to remove any personally identifiable information on participants, consists of 80 participants of varied appearance performing several gaze-elicited tasks, and is divided in two subsets: 1) Gaze Prediction Dataset, with up to 66,560 sequences containing 550,400 eye-images and respective gaze vectors, created to foster research in spatio-temporal gaze estimation and prediction approaches; and 2) Eye Segmentation Dataset, consisting of 200 sequences sampled at 5 Hz, with up to 29,500 images, of which 5% contain a semantic segmentation label, devised to encourage the use of temporal information to propagate labels to contiguous frames. Baseline experiments have been evaluated on OpenEDS2020, one for each task, with average angular error of 5.37 degrees when performing gaze prediction on 1 to 5 frames into the future, and a mean intersection over union score of 84.1% for semantic segmentation. As its predecessor, OpenEDS dataset, we anticipate that this new dataset will continue creating opportunities to researchers in eye tracking, machine learning and computer vision communities, to advance the state of the art for virtual reality applications. The dataset is available for download upon request at http://research.fb.com/programs/openeds-2020-challenge/.

- **Summary**: Subspace clustering methods based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of other data points have achieved great success in computer vision applications such as motion segmentation, face and digit clustering. In face clustering, the subspaces are linear and subspace clustering methods can be applied directly. In motion segmentation, the subspaces are affine and an additional affine constraint on the coefficients is often enforced. However, since affine subspaces can always be embedded into linear subspaces of one extra dimension, it is unclear if the affine constraint is really necessary. This paper shows, both theoretically and empirically, that when the dimension of the ambient space is high relative to the sum of the dimensions of the affine subspaces, the affine constraint has a negligible effect on clustering performance. Specifically, our analysis provides conditions that guarantee the correctness of affine subspace clustering methods both with and without the affine constraint, and shows that these conditions are satisfied for high-dimensional data. Underlying our analysis is the notion of affinely independent subspaces, which not only provides geometrically interpretable correctness conditions, but also clarifies the relationships between existing results for affine subspace clustering.

- **Summary**: Many existing face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods focus on modeling the decision boundaries for some predefined spoof types. However, the diversity of the spoof samples including the unknown ones hinders the effective decision boundary modeling and leads to weak generalization capability. In this paper, we reformulate FAS in an anomaly detection perspective and propose a residual-learning framework to learn the discriminative live-spoof differences which are defined as the spoof cues. The proposed framework consists of a spoof cue generator and an auxiliary classifier. The generator minimizes the spoof cues of live samples while imposes no explicit constraint on those of spoof samples to generalize well to unseen attacks. In this way, anomaly detection is implicitly used to guide spoof cue generation, leading to discriminative feature learning. The auxiliary classifier serves as a spoof cue amplifier and makes the spoof cues more discriminative. We conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results show the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/vis-var/lgsc-for-fas.

- **Summary**: Automatic tumor segmentation is a crucial step in medical image analysis for computer-aided diagnosis. Although the existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance, many challenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This is because regular CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, ignoring further inherent symmetries existing in medical images such as rotations and reflections. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised on every orientation, which can effectively address the gaps of learning symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks globally equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layerwise symmetry constraints. By exploiting further symmetries, novel segmentation CNNs can dramatically reduce the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters (by roughly 2/3) over regular CNNs. More importantly, based on our novel framework, we show that a newly built GER-UNet outperforms its regular CNN-based counterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods on real-world clinical data. Specifically, the group layers of our segmentation framework can be seamlessly integrated into any popular CNN-based segmentation architectures.

- **Summary**: Objective: Preterm infants' limb monitoring in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is of primary importance for assessing infants' health status and motor/cognitive development. Herein, we propose a new approach to preterm infants' limb pose estimation that features spatio-temporal information to detect and track limb joints from depth videos with high reliability. Methods: Limb-pose estimation is performed using a deep-learning framework consisting of a detection and a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) for rough and precise joint localization, respectively. The CNNs are implemented to encode connectivity in the temporal direction through 3D convolution. Assessment of the proposed framework is performed through a comprehensive study with sixteen depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice from sixteen preterm infants (the babyPose dataset). Results: When applied to pose estimation, the median root mean squared distance, computed among all limbs, between the estimated and the ground-truth pose was 9.06 pixels, overcoming approaches based on spatial features only (11.27pixels). Conclusion: Results showed that the spatio-temporal features had a significant influence on the pose-estimation performance, especially in challenging cases (e.g., homogeneous image intensity). Significance: This paper significantly enhances the state of art in automatic assessment of preterm infants' health status by introducing the use of spatio-temporal features for limb detection and tracking, and by being the first study to use depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice for limb-pose estimation. The babyPose dataset has been released as the first annotated dataset for infants' pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have set latest state-of-the-art on various human activity recognition (HAR) datasets. However, deep CNNs often require more computing resources, which limits their applications in embedded HAR. Although many successful methods have been proposed to reduce memory and FLOPs of CNNs, they often involve special network architectures designed for visual tasks, which are not suitable for deep HAR tasks with time series sensor signals, due to remarkable discrepancy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop lightweight deep models to perform HAR. As filter is the basic unit in constructing CNNs, it deserves further research whether re-designing smaller filters is applicable for deep HAR. In the paper, inspired by the idea, we proposed a lightweight CNN using Lego filters for HAR. A set of lower-dimensional filters is used as Lego bricks to be stacked for conventional filters, which does not rely on any special network structure. The local loss function is used to train model. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that proposes lightweight CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable computing arena. The experiment results on five public HAR datasets, UCI-HAR dataset, OPPORTUNITY dataset, UNIMIB-SHAR dataset, PAMAP2 dataset, and WISDM dataset collected from either smartphones or multiple sensor nodes, indicate that our novel Lego CNN with local loss can greatly reduce memory and computation cost over CNN, while achieving higher accuracy. That is to say, the proposed model is smaller, faster and more accurate. Finally, we evaluate the actual performance on an Android smartphone.

- **Summary**: Coronavirus 2019 has made a significant impact on the world. One effective strategy to prevent infection for people is to wear masks in public places. Certain public service providers require clients to use their services only if they properly wear masks. There are, however, only a few research studies on automatic face mask detection. In this paper, we proposed RetinaFaceMask, the first high-performance single stage face mask detector. First, to solve the issue that existing studies did not distinguish between correct and incorrect mask wearing states, we established a new dataset containing these annotations. Second, we proposed a context attention module to focus on learning discriminated features associated with face mask wearing states. Third, we transferred the knowledge from the face detection task, inspired by how humans improve their ability via learning from similar tasks. Ablation studies showed the advantages of the proposed model. Experimental findings on both the public and new datasets demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our model.

- **Summary**: The pursuit of high performance on public benchmarks has been the driving force for research in scene text recognition, and notable progress has been achieved. However, a close investigation reveals a startling fact that the state-of-the-art methods perform well on images with words within vocabulary but generalize poorly to images with words outside vocabulary. We call this phenomenon "vocabulary reliance". In this paper, we establish an analytical framework to conduct an in-depth study on the problem of vocabulary reliance in scene text recognition. Key findings include: (1) Vocabulary reliance is ubiquitous, i.e., all existing algorithms more or less exhibit such characteristic; (2) Attention-based decoders prove weak in generalizing to words outside vocabulary and segmentation-based decoders perform well in utilizing visual features; (3) Context modeling is highly coupled with the prediction layers. These findings provide new insights and can benefit future research in scene text recognition. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective mutual learning strategy to allow models of two families (attention-based and segmentation-based) to learn collaboratively. This remedy alleviates the problem of vocabulary reliance and improves the overall scene text recognition performance.

- **Summary**: Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world since it came in sight in December 2019. It has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images. Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class decision in representation based techniques.

- **Summary**: In a generic object tracking, depth (D) information provides informative cues for foreground-background separation and target bounding box regression. However, so far, few trackers have used depth information to play the important role aforementioned due to the lack of a suitable model. In this paper, a RGB-D tracker named TSDM is proposed, which is composed of a Mask-generator (M-g), SiamRPN++ and a Depth-refiner (D-r). The M-g generates the background masks, and updates them as the target 3D position changes. The D-r optimizes the target bounding box estimated by SiamRPN++, based on the spatial depth distribution difference between the target and the surrounding background. Extensive evaluation on the Princeton Tracking Benchmark and the Visual Object Tracking challenge shows that our tracker outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin while achieving 23 FPS. In addition, a light-weight variant can run at 31 FPS and thus it is practical for real world applications. Code and models of TSDM are available at https://github.com/lql-team/TSDM.

- **Summary**: In this article, we describe and validate the first fully automatic parameter optimization for thermal synthetic aperture visualization. It replaces previous manual exploration of the parameter space, which is time consuming and error prone. We prove that the visibility of targets in thermal integral images is proportional to the variance of the targets' image. Since this is invariant to occlusion it represents a suitable objective function for optimization. Our findings have the potential to enable fully autonomous search and recuse operations with camera drones.

- **Summary**: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Understanding the underlying gene mutations in HCC provides great prognostic value for treatment planning and targeted therapy. Radiogenomics has revealed an association between non-invasive imaging features and molecular genomics. However, imaging feature identification is laborious and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for mutation prediction in APOB, COL11A1 and ATRX genes using multiphasic CT scans. Considering intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) in HCC, multi-region sampling technology is implemented to generate the dataset for experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Accurate environment perception is essential for automated driving. When using monocular cameras, the distance estimation of elements in the environment poses a major challenge. Distances can be more easily estimated when the camera perspective is transformed to a bird's eye view (BEV). For flat surfaces, Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) can accurately transform images to a BEV. Three-dimensional objects such as vehicles and vulnerable road users are distorted by this transformation making it difficult to estimate their position relative to the sensor. This paper describes a methodology to obtain a corrected 360{\deg} BEV image given images from multiple vehicle-mounted cameras. The corrected BEV image is segmented into semantic classes and includes a prediction of occluded areas. The neural network approach does not rely on manually labeled data, but is trained on a synthetic dataset in such a way that it generalizes well to real-world data. By using semantically segmented images as input, we reduce the reality gap between simulated and real-world data and are able to show that our method can be successfully applied in the real world. Extensive experiments conducted on the synthetic data demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to IPM.

- **Summary**: Visual Dialog involves "understanding" the dialog history (what has been discussed previously) and the current question (what is asked), in addition to grounding information in the image, to generate the correct response. In this paper, we show that co-attention models which explicitly encode dialog history outperform models that don't, achieving state-of-the-art performance (72 % NDCG on val set). However, we also expose shortcomings of the crowd-sourcing dataset collection procedure by showing that history is indeed only required for a small amount of the data and that the current evaluation metric encourages generic replies. To that end, we propose a challenging subset (VisDialConv) of the VisDial val set and provide a benchmark of 63% NDCG.

- **Summary**: Pistachios are nutritious nuts that are sorted based on the shape of their shell into two categories: Open-mouth and Closed-mouth. The open-mouth pistachios are higher in price, value, and demand than the closed-mouth pistachios. Because of these differences, it is considerable for production companies to precisely count the number of each kind. This paper aims to propose a new system for counting the different types of pistachios with computer vision. We have introduced and shared a new dataset of pistachios, including six videos with a total length of 167 seconds and 3927 labeled pistachios. Unlike many other works, our model counts pistachios in videos, not images. Counting objects in videos need assigning each object between the video frames so that each object be counted once. The main two challenges in our work are the existence of pistachios' occlusion and deformation of pistachios in different frames because open-mouth pistachios that move and roll on the transportation line may appear as closed-mouth in some frames and open-mouth in other frames. Our novel model first is trained on the RetinaNet object detector network using our dataset to detect different types of pistachios in video frames. After gathering the detections, we apply them to a new counter algorithm based on a new tracker to assign pistachios in consecutive frames with high accuracy. Our model is able to assign pistachios that turn and change their appearance (e.g., open-mouth pistachios that look closed-mouth) to each other so does not count them incorrectly. Our algorithm performs very fast and achieves good counting results. The computed accuracy of our algorithm on six videos (9486 frames) is 94.75%.

- **Summary**: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to generalize the classifier learned from the source domain to the target domain. Existing DA methods usually assume that rich labels could be available in the source domain. However, there are usually a large number of unlabeled data but only a few labeled data in the source domain, and how to transfer knowledge from this sparsely-labeled source domain to the target domain is still a challenge, which greatly limits their application in the wild. This paper proposes a novel Sparsely-Labeled Source Assisted Domain Adaptation (SLSA-DA) algorithm to address the challenge with limited labeled source domain samples. Specifically, due to the label scarcity problem, the projected clustering is conducted on both the source and target domains, so that the discriminative structures of data could be leveraged elegantly. Then the label propagation is adopted to propagate the labels from those limited labeled source samples to the whole unlabeled data progressively, so that the cluster labels are revealed correctly. Finally, we jointly align the marginal and conditional distributions to mitigate the cross-domain mismatch problem, and optimize those three procedures iteratively. However, it is nontrivial to incorporate those three procedures into a unified optimization framework seamlessly since some variables to be optimized are implicitly involved in their formulas, thus they could not promote to each other. Remarkably, we prove that the projected clustering and conditional distribution alignment could be reformulated as different expressions, thus the implicit variables are revealed in different optimization steps. As such, the variables related to those three quantities could be optimized in a unified optimization framework and facilitate to each other, to improve the recognition performance obviously.

- **Summary**: This paper reviews the NTIRE 2020 challenge on real image denoising with focus on the newly introduced dataset, the proposed methods and their results. The challenge is a new version of the previous NTIRE 2019 challenge on real image denoising that was based on the SIDD benchmark. This challenge is based on a newly collected validation and testing image datasets, and hence, named SIDD+. This challenge has two tracks for quantitatively evaluating image denoising performance in (1) the Bayer-pattern rawRGB and (2) the standard RGB (sRGB) color spaces. Each track ~250 registered participants. A total of 22 teams, proposing 24 methods, competed in the final phase of the challenge. The proposed methods by the participating teams represent the current state-of-the-art performance in image denoising targeting real noisy images. The newly collected SIDD+ datasets are publicly available at: https://bit.ly/siddplus_data.

- **Summary**: Facial landmark detection has been studied over decades. Numerous neural network (NN)-based approaches have been proposed for detecting landmarks, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches. In general, CNN-based approaches can be divided into regression and heatmap approaches. However, no research systematically studies the characteristics of different approaches. In this paper, we investigate both CNN-based approaches, generalize their advantages and disadvantages, and introduce a variation of the heatmap approach, a pixel-wise classification (PWC) model. To the best of our knowledge, using the PWC model to detect facial landmarks have not been comprehensively studied. We further design a hybrid loss function and a discrimination network for strengthening the landmarks' interrelationship implied in the PWC model to improve the detection accuracy without modifying the original model architecture. Six common facial landmark datasets, AFW, Helen, LFPW, 300-W, IBUG, and COFW are adopted to train or evaluate our model. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted and the result shows that the proposed model outperforms other models in all tested datasets.

- **Summary**: Network quantization is an essential procedure in deep learning for development of efficient fixed-point inference models on mobile or edge platforms. However, as datasets grow larger and privacy regulations become stricter, data sharing for model compression gets more difficult and restricted. In this paper, we consider data-free network quantization with synthetic data. The synthetic data are generated from a generator, while no data are used in training the generator and in quantization. To this end, we propose data-free adversarial knowledge distillation, which minimizes the maximum distance between the outputs of the teacher and the (quantized) student for any adversarial samples from a generator. To generate adversarial samples similar to the original data, we additionally propose matching statistics from the batch normalization layers for generated data and the original data in the teacher. Furthermore, we show the gain of producing diverse adversarial samples by using multiple generators and multiple students. Our experiments show the state-of-the-art data-free model compression and quantization results for (wide) residual networks and MobileNet on SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. The accuracy losses compared to using the original datasets are shown to be very minimal.

- **Summary**: Several bandwise total variation (TV) regularized low-rank (LR)-based models have been proposed to remove mixed noise in hyperspectral images (HSIs). Conventionally, the rank of LR matrix is approximated using nuclear norm (NN). The NN is defined by adding all singular values together, which is essentially a $L_1$-norm of the singular values. It results in non-negligible approximation errors and thus the resulting matrix estimator can be significantly biased. Moreover, these bandwise TV-based methods exploit the spatial information in a separate manner. To cope with these problems, we propose a spatial-spectral TV (SSTV) regularized non-convex local LR matrix approximation (NonLLRTV) method to remove mixed noise in HSIs. From one aspect, local LR of HSIs is formulated using a non-convex $L_{\gamma}$-norm, which provides a closer approximation to the matrix rank than the traditional NN. From another aspect, HSIs are assumed to be piecewisely smooth in the global spatial domain. The TV regularization is effective in preserving the smoothness and removing Gaussian noise. These facts inspire the integration of the NonLLR with TV regularization. To address the limitations of bandwise TV, we use the SSTV regularization to simultaneously consider global spatial structure and spectral correlation of neighboring bands. Experiment results indicate that the use of local non-convex penalty and global SSTV can boost the preserving of spatial piecewise smoothness and overall structural information.

- **Summary**: Our objective in this work is long range understanding of the narrative structure of movies. Instead of considering the entire movie, we propose to learn from the `key scenes' of the movie, providing a condensed look at the full storyline. To this end, we make the following three contributions: (i) We create the Condensed Movies Dataset (CMD) consisting of the key scenes from over 3K movies: each key scene is accompanied by a high level semantic description of the scene, character face-tracks, and metadata about the movie. The dataset is scalable, obtained automatically from YouTube, and is freely available for anybody to download and use. It is also an order of magnitude larger than existing movie datasets in the number of movies; (ii) We provide a deep network baseline for text-to-video retrieval on our dataset, combining character, speech and visual cues into a single video embedding; and finally (iii) We demonstrate how the addition of context from other video clips improves retrieval performance.

- **Summary**: Detecting pedestrians and predicting future trajectories for them are critical tasks for numerous applications, such as autonomous driving. Previous methods either treat the detection and prediction as separate tasks or simply add a trajectory regression head on top of a detector. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end two-stage network: Spatio-Temporal-Interactive Network (STINet). In addition to 3D geometry modeling of pedestrians, we model the temporal information for each of the pedestrians. To do so, our method predicts both current and past locations in the first stage, so that each pedestrian can be linked across frames and the comprehensive spatio-temporal information can be captured in the second stage. Also, we model the interaction among objects with an interaction graph, to gather the information among the neighboring objects. Comprehensive experiments on the Lyft Dataset and the recently released large-scale Waymo Open Dataset for both object detection and future trajectory prediction validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For the Waymo Open Dataset, we achieve a bird-eyes-view (BEV) detection AP of 80.73 and trajectory prediction average displacement error (ADE) of 33.67cm for pedestrians, which establish the state-of-the-art for both tasks.

- **Summary**: Point cloud based methods have produced promising results in areas such as 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, most of the recent point cloud work focuses on single depth sensor data, whereas less work has been done on indoor monitoring applications, such as operation room monitoring in hospitals or indoor surveillance. In these scenarios multiple cameras are often used to tackle occlusion problems. We propose an end-to-end multi-person 3D pose estimation network, Point R-CNN, using multiple point cloud sources. We conduct extensive experiments to simulate challenging real world cases, such as individual camera failures, various target appearances, and complex cluttered scenes with the CMU panoptic dataset and the MVOR operation room dataset. Unlike most of the previous methods that attempt to use multiple sensor information by building complex fusion models, which often lead to poor generalization, we take advantage of the efficiency of concatenating point clouds to fuse the information at the input level. In the meantime, we show our end-to-end network greatly outperforms cascaded state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Behavior prediction in dynamic, multi-agent systems is an important problem in the context of self-driving cars, due to the complex representations and interactions of road components, including moving agents (e.g. pedestrians and vehicles) and road context information (e.g. lanes, traffic lights). This paper introduces VectorNet, a hierarchical graph neural network that first exploits the spatial locality of individual road components represented by vectors and then models the high-order interactions among all components. In contrast to most recent approaches, which render trajectories of moving agents and road context information as bird-eye images and encode them with convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), our approach operates on a vector representation. By operating on the vectorized high definition (HD) maps and agent trajectories, we avoid lossy rendering and computationally intensive ConvNet encoding steps. To further boost VectorNet's capability in learning context features, we propose a novel auxiliary task to recover the randomly masked out map entities and agent trajectories based on their context. We evaluate VectorNet on our in-house behavior prediction benchmark and the recently released Argoverse forecasting dataset. Our method achieves on par or better performance than the competitive rendering approach on both benchmarks while saving over 70% of the model parameters with an order of magnitude reduction in FLOPs. It also outperforms the state of the art on the Argoverse dataset.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network based learning approaches is widely utilized for image classification or object detection based problems with remarkable outcomes. Realtime Object state estimation of objects can be used to track and estimate the features that the object of the current frame possesses without causing any significant delay and misclassification. A system that can detect the features of such objects in the present state from camera images can be used to enhance the application of Augmented Reality for improving user experience and delivering information in a much perceptual way. The focus behind this paper is to determine the most suitable model to create a low-latency assistance AR to aid users by providing them nutritional information about the food that they consume in order to promote healthier life choices. Hence the dataset has been collected and acquired in such a manner, and we conduct various tests in order to identify the most suitable DNN in terms of performance and complexity and establish a system that renders such information realtime to the user.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are a key component of behavior prediction and motion generation for self-driving cars. One of their main drawbacks is a lack of transparency: they should provide easy to interpret rationales for what triggers certain behaviors. We propose an architecture called Attentional Bottleneck with the goal of improving transparency. Our key idea is to combine visual attention, which identifies what aspects of the input the model is using, with an information bottleneck that enables the model to only use aspects of the input which are important. This not only provides sparse and interpretable attention maps (e.g. focusing only on specific vehicles in the scene), but it adds this transparency at no cost to model accuracy. In fact, we find slight improvements in accuracy when applying Attentional Bottleneck to the ChauffeurNet model, whereas we find that the accuracy deteriorates with a traditional visual attention model.

- **Summary**: Three factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data, and the amount of compute available for training. Algorithmic progress has traditionally been more difficult to quantify than compute and data. In this work, we argue that algorithmic progress has an aspect that is both straightforward to measure and interesting: reductions over time in the compute needed to reach past capabilities. We show that the number of floating-point operations required to train a classifier to AlexNet-level performance on ImageNet has decreased by a factor of 44x between 2012 and 2019. This corresponds to algorithmic efficiency doubling every 16 months over a period of 7 years. By contrast, Moore's Law would only have yielded an 11x cost improvement. We observe that hardware and algorithmic efficiency gains multiply and can be on a similar scale over meaningful horizons, which suggests that a good model of AI progress should integrate measures from both.

- **Summary**: Medical image computing has advanced rapidly with the advent of deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks. Deep convolutional neural networks can perform exceedingly well given full supervision. However, the success of such fully-supervised models for various image analysis tasks (e.g., anatomy or lesion segmentation from medical images) is limited to the availability of massive amounts of labeled data. Given small sample sizes, such models are prohibitively data biased with large domain shift. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end medical image segmentation model, namely Progressive Adversarial Semantic Segmentation (PASS), which can make improved segmentation predictions without requiring any domain-specific data during training time. Our extensive experimentation with 8 public diabetic retinopathy and chest X-ray datasets, confirms the effectiveness of PASS for accurate vascular and pulmonary segmentation, both for in-domain and cross-domain evaluations.

- **Summary**: Tactile sensing is an essential modality for smart robots as it enables them to interact flexibly with physical objects in their environment. Recent advancements in electronic skins have led to the development of data-driven machine learning methods that exploit this important sensory modality. However, current datasets used to train such algorithms are limited to standard synchronous tactile sensors. There is a dearth of neuromorphic event-based tactile datasets, principally due to the scarcity of large-scale event-based tactile sensors. Having such datasets is crucial for the development and evaluation of new algorithms that process spatio-temporal event-based data. For example, evaluating spiking neural networks on conventional frame-based datasets is considered sub-optimal. Here, we debut a novel neuromorphic Spiking Tactile MNIST (ST-MNIST) dataset, which comprises handwritten digits obtained by human participants writing on a neuromorphic tactile sensor array. We also describe an initial effort to evaluate our ST-MNIST dataset using existing artificial and spiking neural network models. The classification accuracies provided herein can serve as performance benchmarks for future work. We anticipate that our ST-MNIST dataset will be of interest and useful to the neuromorphic and robotics research communities.

- **Summary**: Floods are among the most frequent and catastrophic natural disasters and affect millions of people worldwide. It is important to create accurate flood maps to plan (offline) and conduct (real-time) flood mitigation and flood rescue operations. Arguably, images collected from social media can provide useful information for that task, which would otherwise be unavailable. We introduce a computer vision system that estimates water depth from social media images taken during flooding events, in order to build flood maps in (near) real-time. We propose a multi-task (deep) learning approach, where a model is trained using both a regression and a pairwise ranking loss. Our approach is motivated by the observation that a main bottleneck for image-based flood level estimation is training data: it is diffcult and requires a lot of effort to annotate uncontrolled images with the correct water depth. We demonstrate how to effciently learn a predictor from a small set of annotated water levels and a larger set of weaker annotations that only indicate in which of two images the water level is higher, and are much easier to obtain. Moreover, we provide a new dataset, named DeepFlood, with 8145 annotated ground-level images, and show that the proposed multi-task approach can predict the water level from a single, crowd-sourced image with ~11 cm root mean square error.

- **Summary**: As science and engineering have become increasingly data-driven, the role of optimization has expanded to touch almost every stage of the data analysis pipeline, from signal and data acquisition to modeling and prediction. The optimization problems encountered in practice are often nonconvex. While challenges vary from problem to problem, one common source of nonconvexity is nonlinearity in the data or measurement model. Nonlinear models often exhibit symmetries, creating complicated, nonconvex objective landscapes, with multiple equivalent solutions. Nevertheless, simple methods (e.g., gradient descent) often perform surprisingly well in practice.   The goal of this survey is to highlight a class of tractable nonconvex problems, which can be understood through the lens of symmetries. These problems exhibit a characteristic geometric structure: local minimizers are symmetric copies of a single "ground truth" solution, while other critical points occur at balanced superpositions of symmetric copies of the ground truth, and exhibit negative curvature in directions that break the symmetry. This structure enables efficient methods to obtain global minimizers. We discuss examples of this phenomenon arising from a wide range of problems in imaging, signal processing, and data analysis. We highlight the key role of symmetry in shaping the objective landscape and discuss the different roles of rotational and discrete symmetries. This area is rich with observed phenomena and open problems; we close by highlighting directions for future research.



### JNR: Joint-based Neural Rig Representation for Compact 3D Face Modeling

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn a 3D face model using a joint-based face rig and a neural skinning network. Thanks to the joint-based representation, our model enjoys some significant advantages over prior blendshape-based models. First, it is very compact such that we are orders of magnitude smaller while still keeping strong modeling capacity. Second, because each joint has its semantic meaning, interactive facial geometry editing is made easier and more intuitive. Third, through skinning, our model supports adding mouth interior and eyes, as well as accessories (hair, eye glasses, etc.) in a simpler, more accurate and principled way. We argue that because the human face is highly structured and topologically consistent, it does not need to be learned entirely from data. Instead we can leverage prior knowledge in the form of a human-designed 3D face rig to reduce the data dependency, and learn a compact yet strong face model from only a small dataset (less than one hundred 3D scans). To further improve the modeling capacity, we train a skinning weight generator through adversarial learning. Experiments on fitting high-quality 3D scans (both neutral and expressive), noisy depth images, and RGB images demonstrate that its modeling capacity is on-par with state-of-the-art face models, such as FLAME and Facewarehouse, even though the model is 10 to 20 times smaller. This suggests broad value in both graphics and vision applications on mobile and edge devices.

- **Summary**: Traditional methods for image-based 3D face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting fit a 3D morphable model (3DMM) to the face, which has limited modeling capacity and fail to generalize well to in-the-wild data. Use of deformation transfer or multilinear tensor as a personalized 3DMM for blendshape interpolation does not address the fact that facial expressions result in different local and global skin deformations in different persons. Moreover, existing methods learn a single albedo per user which is not enough to capture the expression-specific skin reflectance variations. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly learns a personalized face model per user and per-frame facial motion parameters from a large corpus of in-the-wild videos of user expressions. Specifically, we learn user-specific expression blendshapes and dynamic (expression-specific) albedo maps by predicting personalized corrections on top of a 3DMM prior. We introduce novel constraints to ensure that the corrected blendshapes retain their semantic meanings and the reconstructed geometry is disentangled from the albedo. Experimental results show that our personalization accurately captures fine-grained facial dynamics in a wide range of conditions and efficiently decouples the learned face model from facial motion, resulting in more accurate face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: By adding human-imperceptible noise to clean images, the resultant adversarial examples can fool other unknown models. Features of a pixel extracted by deep neural networks (DNNs) are influenced by its surrounding regions, and different DNNs generally focus on different discriminative regions in recognition. Motivated by this, we propose a patch-wise iterative algorithm -- a black-box attack towards mainstream normally trained and defense models, which differs from the existing attack methods manipulating pixel-wise noise. In this way, without sacrificing the performance of white-box attack, our adversarial examples can have strong transferability. Specifically, we introduce an amplification factor to the step size in each iteration, and one pixel's overall gradient overflowing the $\epsilon$-constraint is properly assigned to its surrounding regions by a project kernel. Our method can be generally integrated to any gradient-based attack methods. Compared with the current state-of-the-art attacks, we significantly improve the success rate by 9.2\% for defense models and 3.7\% for normally trained models on average.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a study on semi-supervised learning to solve the visual attribute prediction problem. In many applications of vision algorithms, the precise recognition of visual attributes of objects is important but still challenging. This is because defining a class hierarchy of attributes is ambiguous, so training data inevitably suffer from class imbalance and label sparsity, leading to a lack of effective annotations. An intuitive solution is to find a method to effectively learn image representations by utilizing unlabeled images. With that in mind, we propose a multi-teacher-single-student (MTSS) approach inspired by the multi-task learning and the distillation of semi-supervised learning. Our MTSS learns task-specific domain experts called teacher networks using the label embedding technique and learns a unified model called a student network by forcing a model to mimic the distributions learned by domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive performance on various benchmarks for fashion attribute prediction, but also improves robustness and cross-domain adaptability for unseen domains.

- **Summary**: In this work we show that semi-supervised models for vehicle trajectory prediction significantly improve performance over supervised models on state-of-the-art real-world benchmarks. Moving from supervised to semi-supervised models allows scaling-up by using unlabeled data, increasing the number of images in pre-training from Millions to a Billion. We perform ablation studies comparing transfer learning of semi-supervised and supervised models while keeping all other factors equal. Within semi-supervised models we compare contrastive learning with teacher-student methods as well as networks predicting a small number of trajectories with networks predicting probabilities over a large trajectory set. Our results using both low-level and mid-level representations of the driving environment demonstrate the applicability of semi-supervised methods for real-world vehicle trajectory prediction.

- **Summary**: Remote heart rate estimation is the measurement of heart rate without any physical contact with the subject and is accomplished using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) in this work. rPPG signals are usually collected using a video camera with a limitation of being sensitive to multiple contributing factors, e.g. variation in skin tone, lighting condition and facial structure. End-to-end supervised learning approach performs well when training data is abundant, covering a distribution that doesn't deviate too much from the distribution of testing data or during deployment. To cope with the unforeseeable distributional changes during deployment, we propose a transductive meta-learner that takes unlabeled samples during testing (deployment) for a self-supervised weight adjustment (also known as transductive inference), providing fast adaptation to the distributional changes. Using this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MAHNOB-HCI and UBFC-rPPG.

- **Summary**: Fusing data from multiple modalities provides more information to train machine learning systems. However, it is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to label each modality with a large amount of data, which leads to a crucial problem of semi-supervised multi-modal learning. Existing methods suffer from either ineffective fusion across modalities or lack of theoretical guarantees under proper assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel information-theoretic approach, namely \textbf{T}otal \textbf{C}orrelation \textbf{G}ain \textbf{M}aximization (TCGM), for semi-supervised multi-modal learning, which is endowed with promising properties: (i) it can utilize effectively the information across different modalities of unlabeled data points to facilitate training classifiers of each modality (ii) it has theoretical guarantee to identify Bayesian classifiers, i.e., the ground truth posteriors of all modalities. Specifically, by maximizing TC-induced loss (namely TC gain) over classifiers of all modalities, these classifiers can cooperatively discover the equivalent class of ground-truth classifiers; and identify the unique ones by leveraging limited percentage of labeled data. We apply our method to various tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, including news classification, emotion recognition and disease prediction.

- **Summary**: For recognizing speakers in video streams, significant research studies have been made to obtain a rich machine learning model by extracting high-level speaker's features such as facial expression, emotion, and gender. However, generating such a model is not feasible by using only single modality feature extractors that exploit either audio signals or image frames, extracted from video streams. In this paper, we address this problem from a different perspective and propose an unprecedented multimodality data fusion framework called DeepMSRF, Deep Multimodal Speaker Recognition with Feature selection. We execute DeepMSRF by feeding features of the two modalities, namely speakers' audios and face images. DeepMSRF uses a two-stream VGGNET to train on both modalities to reach a comprehensive model capable of accurately recognizing the speaker's identity. We apply DeepMSRF on a subset of VoxCeleb2 dataset with its metadata merged with VGGFace2 dataset. The goal of DeepMSRF is to identify the gender of the speaker first, and further to recognize his or her name for any given video stream. The experimental results illustrate that DeepMSRF outperforms single modality speaker recognition methods with at least 3 percent accuracy.

- **Summary**: Existing RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) approaches concentrate on the cross-modal fusion between the RGB stream and the depth stream. They do not deeply explore the effect of the depth map itself. In this work, we design a single stream network to directly use the depth map to guide early fusion and middle fusion between RGB and depth, which saves the feature encoder of the depth stream and achieves a lightweight and real-time model. We tactfully utilize depth information from two perspectives: (1) Overcoming the incompatibility problem caused by the great difference between modalities, we build a single stream encoder to achieve the early fusion, which can take full advantage of ImageNet pre-trained backbone model to extract rich and discriminative features. (2) We design a novel depth-enhanced dual attention module (DEDA) to efficiently provide the fore-/back-ground branches with the spatially filtered features, which enables the decoder to optimally perform the middle fusion. Besides, we put forward a pyramidally attended feature extraction module (PAFE) to accurately localize the objects of different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, this model is 55.5\% lighter than the current lightest model and runs at a real-time speed of 32 FPS when processing a $384 \times 384$ image.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Many meta-learning methods are proposed for few-shot detection. However, previous most methods have two main problems, poor detection APs, and strong bias because of imbalance and insufficient datasets. Previous works mainly alleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation attention mechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for meta-learning, we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant semantic features between categories. Therefore, based on semantic features, we propose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for classification task and a category-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features obtained by the meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most likely C-1 false classification predictions to improve detection performance on few-shot classes. According to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance, shape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which objects often appear, the category-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint groups to make similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group and obtain more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong bias problem and further improving detection APs. The whole training consists of the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According to grouping mechanism, we group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the distribution difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each group is less. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that ours which combines the TCL-C with category-based grouping significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for few-shot detection. Compared with previous competitive baseline, ours improves detection APs by almost 4% for few-shot detection.

- **Summary**: Predicting consumers' purchasing behaviors is critical for targeted advertisement and sales promotion in e-commerce. Human faces are an invaluable source of information for gaining insights into consumer personality and behavioral traits. However, consumer's faces are largely unexplored in previous research, and the existing face-related studies focus on high-level features such as personality traits while neglecting the business significance of learning from facial data. We propose to predict consumers' purchases based on their facial features and purchasing histories. We design a semi-supervised model based on a hierarchical embedding network to extract high-level features of consumers and to predict the top-$N$ purchase destinations of a consumer. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the positive effect of incorporating facial information in predicting consumers' purchasing behaviors.

- **Summary**: Smooth and seamless robot navigation while interacting with humans depends on predicting human movements. Forecasting such human dynamics often involves modeling human trajectories (global motion) or detailed body joint movements (local motion). Prior work typically tackled local and global human movements separately. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle both tasks of human motion (or trajectory) and body skeleton pose forecasting in a unified end-to-end pipeline. To deal with this real-world problem, we consider incorporating both scene and social contexts, as critical clues for this prediction task, into our proposed framework. To this end, we first couple these two tasks by i) encoding their history using a shared Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) encoder and ii) applying a metric as loss, which measures the source of errors in each task jointly as a single distance. Then, we incorporate the scene context by encoding a spatio-temporal representation of the video data. We also include social clues by generating a joint feature representation from motion and pose of all individuals from the scene using a social pooling layer. Finally, we use a GRU based decoder to forecast both motion and skeleton pose. We demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a superior performance compared to several baselines on two social datasets.

- **Summary**: Topology change is a challenging problem for 4D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. In the classic volumetric fusion-based framework, a mesh is usually extracted from the TSDF volume as the canonical surface representation to help estimating deformation field. However, the surface and Embedded Deformation Graph (EDG) representations bring conflicts under topology changes since the surface mesh has fixed-connectivity but the deformation field can be discontinuous. In this paper, the classic framework is re-designed to enable 4D reconstruction of dynamic scene under topology changes, by introducing a novel structure of Non-manifold Volumetric Grid to the re-design of both TSDF and EDG, which allows connectivity updates by cell splitting and replication. Experiments show convincing reconstruction results for dynamic scenes of topology changes, as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The strict security requirements placed on medical records by various privacy regulations become major obstacles in the age of big data. To ensure efficient machine learning as a service schemes while protecting data confidentiality, in this work, we propose blind UNET (BUNET), a secure protocol that implements privacy-preserving medical image segmentation based on the UNET architecture. In BUNET, we efficiently utilize cryptographic primitives such as homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits (GC) to design a complete secure protocol for the UNET neural architecture. In addition, we perform extensive architectural search in reducing the computational bottleneck of GC-based secure activation protocols with high-dimensional input data. In the experiment, we thoroughly examine the parameter space of our protocol, and show that we can achieve up to 14x inference time reduction compared to the-state-of-the-art secure inference technique on a baseline architecture with negligible accuracy degradation.

- **Summary**: We propose an effective framework for the temporal action segmentation task, namely an Action Segment Refinement Framework (ASRF). Our model architecture consists of a long-term feature extractor and two branches: the Action Segmentation Branch (ASB) and the Boundary Regression Branch (BRB). The long-term feature extractor provides shared features for the two branches with a wide temporal receptive field. The ASB classifies video frames with action classes, while the BRB regresses the action boundary probabilities. The action boundaries predicted by the BRB refine the output from the ASB, which results in a significant performance improvement. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We propose a framework for temporal action segmentation, the ASRF, which divides temporal action segmentation into frame-wise action classification and action boundary regression. Our framework refines frame-level hypotheses of action classes using predicted action boundaries. (ii) We propose a loss function for smoothing the transition of action probabilities, and analyze combinations of various loss functions for temporal action segmentation. (iii) Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three challenging datasets, offering an improvement of up to 13.7% in terms of segmental edit distance and up to 16.1% in terms of segmental F1 score. Our code will be publicly available soon.

- **Summary**: A wide range of image captioning models has been developed, achieving significant improvement based on popular metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, although the generated captions can accurately describe the image, they are generic for similar images and lack distinctiveness, i.e., cannot properly describe the uniqueness of each image. In this paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions through training with sets of similar images. First, we propose a distinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our metric shows that the human annotations of each image are not equivalent based on distinctiveness. Thus we propose several new training strategies to encourage the distinctiveness of the generated caption for each image, which are based on using CIDErBtw in a weighted loss function or as a reinforcement learning reward. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide variety of image captioning baselines. These results are further confirmed through a user study.

- **Summary**: We focus on the task of generating sound from natural videos, and the sound should be both temporally and content-wise aligned with visual signals. This task is extremely challenging because some sounds generated \emph{outside} a camera can not be inferred from video content. The model may be forced to learn an incorrect mapping between visual content and these irrelevant sounds. To address this challenge, we propose a framework named REGNET. In this framework, we first extract appearance and motion features from video frames to better distinguish the object that emits sound from complex background information. We then introduce an innovative audio forwarding regularizer that directly considers the real sound as input and outputs bottlenecked sound features. Using both visual and bottlenecked sound features for sound prediction during training provides stronger supervision for the sound prediction. The audio forwarding regularizer can control the irrelevant sound component and thus prevent the model from learning an incorrect mapping between video frames and sound emitted by the object that is out of the screen. During testing, the audio forwarding regularizer is removed to ensure that REGNET can produce purely aligned sound only from visual features. Extensive evaluations based on Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate that our method significantly improves both temporal and content-wise alignment. Remarkably, our generated sound can fool the human with a 68.12% success rate. Code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/PeihaoChen/regnet

- **Summary**: Recent advances in Siamese network-based visual tracking methods have enabled high performance on numerous tracking benchmarks. However, extensive scale variations of the target object and distractor objects with similar categories have consistently posed challenges in visual tracking. To address these persisting issues, we propose novel TridentAlign and context embedding modules for Siamese network-based visual tracking methods. The TridentAlign module facilitates adaptability to extensive scale variations and large deformations of the target, where it pools the feature representation of the target object into multiple spatial dimensions to form a feature pyramid, which is then utilized in the region proposal stage. Meanwhile, context embedding module aims to discriminate the target from distractor objects by accounting for the global context information among objects. The context embedding module extracts and embeds the global context information of a given frame into a local feature representation such that the information can be utilized in the final classification stage. Experimental results obtained on multiple benchmark datasets show that the performance of the proposed tracker is comparable to that of state-of-the-art trackers, while the proposed tracker runs at real-time speed.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation and semantic edge detection can be seen as two dual problems with close relationships in computer vision. Despite the fast evolution of learning-based 3D semantic segmentation methods, little attention has been drawn to the learning of 3D semantic edge detectors, even less to a joint learning method for the two tasks. In this paper, we tackle the 3D semantic edge detection task for the first time and present a new two-stream fully-convolutional network that jointly performs the two tasks. In particular, we design a joint refinement module that explicitly wires region information and edge information to improve the performances of both tasks. Further, we propose a novel loss function that encourages the network to produce semantic segmentation results with better boundaries. Extensive evaluations on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show that our method achieves on par or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and outperforms the baseline methods for semantic edge detection.

  imbalance problem in multi-task learning
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Multi-task learning (MTL) is to learn one single model that performs multiple tasks for achieving good performance on all tasks and lower cost on computation. Learning such a model requires to jointly optimize losses of a set of tasks with different difficulty levels, magnitudes, and characteristics (e.g. cross-entropy, Euclidean loss), leading to the imbalance problem in multi-task learning. To address the imbalance problem, we propose a knowledge distillation based method in this work. We first learn a task-specific model for each task. We then learn the multi-task model for minimizing task-specific loss and for producing the same feature with task-specific models. As the task-specific network encodes different features, we introduce small task-specific adaptors to project multi-task features to the task-specific features. In this way, the adaptors align the task-specific feature and the multi-task feature, which enables a balanced parameter sharing across tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can optimize a multi-task learning model in a more balanced way and achieve better overall performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework for restoring historical documents content that follows the correct reading order. In this framework, two branches named character branch and layout branch are added behind the feature extraction network. The character branch localizes individual characters in a document image and recognizes them simultaneously. Then we adopt a post-processing method to group them into text lines. The layout branch based on fully convolutional network outputs a binary mask. We then use Hough transform for line detection on the binary mask and combine character results with the layout information to restore document content. These two branches can be trained in parallel and are easy to train. Furthermore, we propose a re-score mechanism to minimize recognition error. Experiment results on the extended Chinese historical document MTHv2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

- **Summary**: In this study, we present a method for all-around depth estimation from multiple omnidirectional images for indoor environments. In particular, we focus on plane-sweeping stereo as the method for depth estimation from the images. We propose a new icosahedron-based representation and ConvNets for omnidirectional images, which we name "CrownConv" because the representation resembles a crown made of origami. CrownConv can be applied to both fisheye images and equirectangular images to extract features. Furthermore, we propose icosahedron-based spherical sweeping for generating the cost volume on an icosahedron from the extracted features. The cost volume is regularized using the three-dimensional CrownConv, and the final depth is obtained by depth regression from the cost volume. Our proposed method is robust to camera alignments by using the extrinsic camera parameters; therefore, it can achieve precise depth estimation even when the camera alignment differs from that in the training dataset. We evaluate the proposed model on synthetic datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness. As our proposed method is computationally efficient, the depth is estimated from four fisheye images in less than a second using a laptop with a GPU. Therefore, it is suitable for real-world robotics applications. Our source code is available at https://github.com/matsuren/crownconv360depth.

- **Summary**: Models that surpass human performance on several popular benchmarks display significant degradation in performance on exposure to Out of Distribution (OOD) data. Recent research has shown that models overfit to spurious biases and `hack' datasets, in lieu of learning generalizable features like humans. In order to stop the inflation in model performance -- and thus overestimation in AI systems' capabilities -- we propose a simple and novel evaluation metric, WOOD Score, that encourages generalization during evaluation.

- **Summary**: We introduce the eigentask framework for lifelong learning. An eigentask is a pairing of a skill that solves a set of related tasks, paired with a generative model that can sample from the skill's input space. The framework extends generative replay approaches, which have mainly been used to avoid catastrophic forgetting, to also address other lifelong learning goals such as forward knowledge transfer. We propose a wake-sleep cycle of alternating task learning and knowledge consolidation for learning in our framework, and instantiate it for lifelong supervised learning and lifelong RL. We achieve improved performance over the state-of-the-art in supervised continual learning, and show evidence of forward knowledge transfer in a lifelong RL application in the game Starcraft2.

- **Summary**: Network quantization allows inference to be conducted using low-precision arithmetic for improved inference efficiency of deep neural networks on edge devices. However, designing aggressively low-bit (e.g., 2-bit) quantization schemes on complex tasks, such as object detection, still remains challenging in terms of severe performance degradation and unverifiable efficiency on common hardware. In this paper, we propose an Accurate Quantized object Detection solution, termed AQD, to fully get rid of floating-point computation. To this end, we target using fixed-point operations in all kinds of layers, including the convolutional layers, normalization layers, and skip connections, allowing the inference to be executed using integer-only arithmetic. To demonstrate the improved latency-vs-accuracy trade-off, we apply the proposed methods on RetinaNet and FCOS. In particular, experimental results on MS-COCO dataset show that our AQD achieves comparable or even better performance compared with the full-precision counterpart under extremely low-bit schemes, which is of great practical value.

- **Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection devotes to learn how humans interact with surrounding objects via inferring triplets of < human, verb, object >. However, recent HOI detection methods mostly rely on additional annotations (e.g., human pose) and neglect powerful interactive reasoning beyond convolutions. In this paper, we present a novel graph-based interactive reasoning model called Interactive Graph (abbr. in-Graph) to infer HOIs, in which interactive semantics implied among visual targets are efficiently exploited. The proposed model consists of a project function that maps related targets from convolution space to a graph-based semantic space, a message passing process propagating semantics among all nodes and an update function transforming the reasoned nodes back to convolution space. Furthermore, we construct a new framework to assemble in-Graph models for detecting HOIs, namely in-GraphNet. Beyond inferring HOIs using instance features respectively, the framework dynamically parses pairwise interactive semantics among visual targets by integrating two-level in-Graphs, i.e., scene-wide and instance-wide in-Graphs. Our framework is end-to-end trainable and free from costly annotations like human pose. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms existing HOI detection methods on both V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks and improves the baseline about 9.4% and 15% relatively, validating its efficacy in detecting HOIs.

- **Summary**: Deep encoder-decoder based CNNs have advanced image inpainting methods for hole filling. While existing methods recover structures and textures step-by-step in the hole regions, they typically use two encoder-decoders for separate recovery. The CNN features of each encoder are learned to capture either missing structures or textures without considering them as a whole. The insufficient utilization of these encoder features limit the performance of recovering both structures and textures. In this paper, we propose a mutual encoder-decoder CNN for joint recovery of both. We use CNN features from the deep and shallow layers of the encoder to represent structures and textures of an input image, respectively. The deep layer features are sent to a structure branch and the shallow layer features are sent to a texture branch. In each branch, we fill holes in multiple scales of the CNN features. The filled CNN features from both branches are concatenated and then equalized. During feature equalization, we reweigh channel attentions first and propose a bilateral propagation activation function to enable spatial equalization. To this end, the filled CNN features of structure and texture mutually benefit each other to represent image content at all feature levels. We use the equalized feature to supplement decoder features for output image generation through skip connections. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show the proposed method is effective to recover structures and textures and performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Even though norm-based filter pruning methods are widely accepted, it is questionable whether the "smaller-norm-less-important" criterion is optimal in determining filters to prune. Especially when we can keep only a small fraction of the original filters, it is more crucial to choose the filters that can best represent the whole filters regardless of norm values. Our novel pruning method entitled "REPrune" addresses this problem by selecting representative filters via clustering. By selecting one filter from a cluster of similar filters and avoiding selecting adjacent large filters, REPrune can achieve a better compression rate with similar accuracy. Our method also recovers the accuracy more rapidly and requires a smaller shift of filters during fine-tuning. Empirically, REPrune reduces more than 49% FLOPs, with 0.53% accuracy gain on ResNet-110 for CIFAR-10. Also, REPrune reduces more than 41.8% FLOPs with 1.67% Top-1 validation loss on ResNet-18 for ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation presents a powerful method to obtain 3D scene information from single camera images, which is trainable on arbitrary image sequences without requiring depth labels, e.g., from a LiDAR sensor. In this work we present a new self-supervised semantically-guided depth estimation (SGDepth) method to deal with moving dynamic-class (DC) objects, such as moving cars and pedestrians, which violate the static-world assumptions typically made during training of such models. Specifically, we propose (i) mutually beneficial cross-domain training of (supervised) semantic segmentation and self-supervised depth estimation with task-specific network heads, (ii) a semantic masking scheme providing guidance to prevent moving DC objects from contaminating the photometric loss, and (iii) a detection method for frames with non-moving DC objects, from which the depth of DC objects can be learned. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several benchmarks, in particular on the Eigen split, where we exceed all baselines without test-time refinement.

- **Summary**: Medical images are naturally associated with rich semantics about the human anatomy, reflected in an abundance of recurring anatomical patterns, offering unique potential to foster deep semantic representation learning and yield semantically more powerful models for different medical applications. But how exactly such strong yet free semantics embedded in medical images can be harnessed for self-supervised learning remains largely unexplored. To this end, we train deep models to learn semantically enriched visual representation by self-discovery, self-classification, and self-restoration of the anatomy underneath medical images, resulting in a semantics-enriched, general-purpose, pre-trained 3D model, named Semantic Genesis. We examine our Semantic Genesis with all the publicly-available pre-trained models, by either self-supervision or fully supervision, on the six distinct target tasks, covering both classification and segmentation in various medical modalities (i.e.,CT, MRI, and X-ray). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic Genesis significantly exceeds all of its 3D counterparts as well as the de facto ImageNet-based transfer learning in 2D. This performance is attributed to our novel self-supervised learning framework, encouraging deep models to learn compelling semantic representation from abundant anatomical patterns resulting from consistent anatomies embedded in medical images.

- **Summary**: One-class novelty detection is to identify anomalous instances that do not conform to the expected normal instances. In this paper, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based on encoder-decoder-encoder pipeline are used for detection and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, deep neural networks are too over-parameterized to deploy on resource-limited devices. Therefore, Progressive Knowledge Distillation with GANs (PKDGAN) is proposed to learn compact and fast novelty detection networks. The P-KDGAN is a novel attempt to connect two standard GANs by the designed distillation loss for transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student. The progressive learning of knowledge distillation is a two-step approach that continuously improves the performance of the student GAN and achieves better performance than single step methods. In the first step, the student GAN learns the basic knowledge totally from the teacher via guiding of the pretrained teacher GAN with fixed weights. In the second step, joint fine-training is adopted for the knowledgeable teacher and student GANs to further improve the performance and stability. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMNIST show that our method improves the performance of the student GAN by 2.44%, 1.77%, and 1.73% when compressing the computation at ratios of 24.45:1, 311.11:1, and 700:1, respectively.

- **Summary**: Models trained on synthetic images often face degraded generalization to real data. As a convention, these models are often initialized with ImageNet pre-trained representation. Yet the role of ImageNet knowledge is seldom discussed despite common practices that leverage this knowledge to maintain the generalization ability. An example is the careful hand-tuning of early stopping and layer-wise learning rates, which is shown to improve synthetic-to-real generalization but is also laborious and heuristic. In this work, we explicitly encourage the synthetically trained model to maintain similar representations with the ImageNet pre-trained model, and propose a \textit{learning-to-optimize (L2O)} strategy to automate the selection of layer-wise learning rates. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the synthetic-to-real generalization performance without seeing and training on real data, while also benefiting downstream tasks such as domain adaptation.

- **Summary**: While deep face recognition has benefited significantly from large-scale labeled data, current research is focused on leveraging unlabeled data to further boost performance, reducing the cost of human annotation. Prior work has mostly been in controlled settings, where the labeled and unlabeled data sets have no overlapping identities by construction. This is not realistic in large-scale face recognition, where one must contend with such overlaps, the frequency of which increases with the volume of data. Ignoring identity overlap leads to significant labeling noise, as data from the same identity is split into multiple clusters. To address this, we propose a novel identity separation method based on extreme value theory. It is formulated as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm, and greatly reduces the problems caused by overlapping-identity label noise. Considering cluster assignments as pseudo-labels, we must also overcome the labeling noise from clustering errors. We propose a modulation of the cosine loss, where the modulation weights correspond to an estimate of clustering uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real settings demonstrate our method's consistent improvements over supervised baselines, e.g., 11.6% improvement on IJB-A verification.

- **Summary**: We propose a method at the intersection of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics fields, which automatically generates RGBD images using neural networks, based on previously seen and synchronized video, depth and pose signals. Since the models must be able to reconstruct both texture (RGB) and structure (Depth), it creates an implicit representation of the scene, as opposed to explicit ones, such as meshes or point clouds. The process can be thought of as neural rendering, where we obtain a function f : Pose -> RGBD, which we can use to navigate through the generated scene, similarly to graphics simulations. We introduce two new datasets, one based on synthetic data with full ground truth information, while the other one being recorded from a drone flight in an university campus, using only video and GPS signals. Finally, we propose a fully unsupervised method of generating datasets from videos alone, in order to train the Pose2RGBD networks.

- **Summary**: Recently, some correlation filter based trackers with detection proposals have achieved state-of-the-art tracking results. However, a large number of redundant proposals given by the proposal generator may degrade the performance and speed of these trackers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive proposal selection algorithm which can generate a small number of high-quality proposals to handle the problem of scale variations for visual object tracking. Specifically, we firstly utilize the color histograms in the HSV color space to represent the instances (i.e., the initial target in the first frame and the predicted target in the previous frame) and proposals. Then, an adaptive strategy based on the color similarity is formulated to select high-quality proposals. We further integrate the proposed adaptive proposal selection algorithm with coarse-to-fine deep features to validate the generalization and efficiency of the proposed tracker. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art trackers.

- **Summary**: How to make a segmentation model efficiently adapt to a specific video and to online target appearance variations are fundamentally crucial issues in the field of video object segmentation. In this work, a graph memory network is developed to address the novel idea of "learning to update the segmentation model". Specifically, we exploit an episodic memory network, organized as a fully connected graph, to store frames as nodes and capture cross-frame correlations by edges. Further, learnable controllers are embedded to ease memory reading and writing, as well as maintain a fixed memory scale. The structured, external memory design enables our model to comprehensively mine and quickly store new knowledge, even with limited visual information, and the differentiable memory controllers slowly learn an abstract method for storing useful representations in the memory and how to later use these representations for prediction, via gradient descent. In addition, the proposed graph memory network yields a neat yet principled framework, which can generalize well both one-shot and zero-shot video object segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets verify that our graph memory network is able to facilitate the adaptation of the segmentation network for case-by-case video object segmentation.

- **Summary**: We present an effective method to progressively integrate and refine the cross-modality complementarities for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD). The proposed network mainly solves two challenging issues: 1) how to effectively integrate the complementary information from RGB image and its corresponding depth map, and 2) how to adaptively select more saliency-related features. First, we propose a cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module to enhance feature representations by taking the depth features as prior, which models the complementary relations of RGB-D data. Second, we propose an adaptive feature selection (AFS) module to select saliency-related features and suppress the inferior ones. The AFS module exploits multi-modality spatial feature fusion with the self-modality and cross-modality interdependencies of channel features are considered. Third, we employ a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module to encourage our network to focus more on saliency-related regions. The above modules as a whole, called cmMS block, facilitates the refinement of saliency features in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Coupled with a bottom-up inference, the refined saliency features enable accurate and edge-preserving SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art saliency detectors on six popular RGB-D SOD benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Learning a good 3D human pose representation is important for human pose related tasks, e.g. human 3D pose estimation and action recognition. Within all these problems, preserving the intrinsic pose information and adapting to view variations are two critical issues. In this work, we propose a novel Siamese denoising autoencoder to learn a 3D pose representation by disentangling the pose-dependent and view-dependent feature from the human skeleton data, in a fully unsupervised manner. These two disentangled features are utilized together as the representation of the 3D pose. To consider both the kinematic and geometric dependencies, a sequential bidirectional recursive network (SeBiReNet) is further proposed to model the human skeleton data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the learned representation 1) preserves the intrinsic information of human pose, 2) shows good transferability across datasets and tasks. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two inherently different tasks: pose denoising and unsupervised action recognition.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success in automated image composition that generates new images by embedding interested foreground objects into background images automatically. On the other hand, most existing works deal with foreground objects in two-dimensional (2D) images though foreground objects in three-dimensional (3D) models are more flexible with 360-degree view freedom. This paper presents an innovative View Alignment GAN (VA-GAN) that composes new images by embedding 3D models into 2D background images realistically and automatically. VA-GAN consists of a texture generator and a differential discriminator that are inter-connected and end-to-end trainable. The differential discriminator guides to learn geometric transformation from background images so that the composed 3D models can be aligned with the background images with realistic poses and views. The texture generator adopts a novel view encoding mechanism for generating accurate object textures for the 3D models under the estimated views. Extensive experiments over two synthesis tasks (car synthesis with KITTI and pedestrian synthesis with Cityscapes) show that VA-GAN achieves high-fidelity composition qualitatively and quantitatively as compared with state-of-the-art generation methods.

- **Summary**: Degraded document image binarization is one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of document image analysis. In this paper, we present a novel approach towards document image binarization by introducing three-player min-max adversarial game. We train the network in an unsupervised setup by assuming that we do not have any paired-training data. In our approach, an Adversarial Texture Augmentation Network (ATANet) first superimposes the texture of a degraded reference image over a clean image. Later, the clean image along with its generated degraded version constitute the pseudo paired-data which is used to train the Unsupervised Document Binarization Network (UDBNet). Following this approach, we have enlarged the document binarization datasets as it generates multiple images having same content feature but different textual feature. These generated noisy images are then fed into the UDBNet to get back the clean version. The joint discriminator which is the third-player of our three-player min-max adversarial game tries to couple both the ATANet and UDBNet. The three-player min-max adversarial game stops, when the distributions modelled by the ATANet and the UDBNet align to the same joint distribution over time. Thus, the joint discriminator enforces the UDBNet to perform better on real degraded image. The experimental results indicate the superior performance of the proposed model over existing state-of-the-art algorithm on widely used DIBCO datasets. The source code of the proposed system is publicly available at https://github.com/VIROBO-15/UDBNET.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to alleviate the problem of domain shift between the distribution of unlabeled data from the target domain w.r.t. labeled data from the source domain. While the single-target UDA scenario is well studied in the literature, Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA) remains largely unexplored despite its practical importance, e.g., in multi-camera video-surveillance applications. The MTDA problem can be addressed by adapting one specialized model per target domain, although this solution is too costly in many real-world applications. Blending multiple targets for MTDA has been proposed, yet this solution may lead to a reduction in model specificity and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised MTDA approach to train a CNN that can generalize well across multiple target domains. Our Multi-Teacher MTDA (MT-MTDA) method relies on multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) to iteratively distill target domain knowledge from multiple teachers to a common student. The KD process is performed in a progressive manner, where the student is trained by each teacher on how to perform UDA for a specific target, instead of directly learning domain adapted features. Finally, instead of combining the knowledge from each teacher, MT-MTDA alternates between teachers that distill knowledge, thereby preserving the specificity of each target (teacher) when learning to adapt to the student. MT-MTDA is compared against state-of-the-art methods on several challenging UDA benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed model can provide a considerably higher level of accuracy across multiple target domains.

- **Summary**: Image denoising can remove natural noise that widely exists in images captured by multimedia devices due to low-quality imaging sensors, unstable image transmission processes, or low light conditions. Recent works also find that image denoising benefits the high-level vision tasks, e.g., image classification. In this work, we try to challenge this common sense and explore a totally new problem, i.e., whether the image denoising can be given the capability of fooling the state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) while enhancing the image quality. To this end, we initiate the very first attempt to study this problem from the perspective of adversarial attack and propose the adversarial denoise attack. More specifically, our main contributions are three-fold: First, we identify a new task that stealthily embeds attacks inside the image denoising module widely deployed in multimedia devices as an image post-processing operation to simultaneously enhance the visual image quality and fool DNNs. Second, we formulate this new task as a kernel prediction problem for image filtering and propose the adversarial-denoising kernel prediction that can produce adversarial-noiseless kernels for effective denoising and adversarial attacking simultaneously. Third, we implement an adaptive perceptual region localization to identify semantic-related vulnerability regions with which the attack can be more effective while not doing too much harm to the denoising. We name the proposed method as Pasadena (Perceptually Aware and Stealthy Adversarial DENoise Attack) and validate our method on the NeurIPS'17 adversarial competition dataset, CVPR2021-AIC-VI: unrestricted adversarial attacks on ImageNet,etc. The comprehensive evaluation and analysis demonstrate that our method not only realizes denoising but also achieves a significantly higher success rate and transferability over state-of-the-art attacks.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, MFRNet, for post-processing (PP) and in-loop filtering (ILF) in the context of video compression. This network consists of four Multi-level Feature review Residual dense Blocks (MFRBs), which are connected using a cascading structure. Each MFRB extracts features from multiple convolutional layers using dense connections and a multi-level residual learning structure. In order to further improve information flow between these blocks, each of them also reuses high dimensional features from the previous MFRB. This network has been integrated into PP and ILF coding modules for both HEVC (HM 16.20) and VVC (VTM 7.0), and fully evaluated under the JVET Common Test Conditions using the Random Access configuration. The experimental results show significant and consistent coding gains over both anchor codecs (HEVC HM and VVC VTM) and also over other existing CNN-based PP/ILF approaches based on Bjontegaard Delta measurements using both PSNR and VMAF for quality assessment. When MFRNet is integrated into HM 16.20, gains up to 16.0% (BD-rate VMAF) are demonstrated for ILF, and up to 21.0% (BD-rate VMAF) for PP. The respective gains for VTM 7.0 are up to 5.1% for ILF and up to 7.1% for PP.

- **Summary**: Automatic writer identification is a common problem in document analysis. State-of-the-art methods typically focus on the feature extraction step with traditional or deep-learning-based techniques. In retrieval problems, re-ranking is a commonly used technique to improve the results. Re-ranking refines an initial ranking result by using the knowledge contained in the ranked result, e. g., by exploiting nearest neighbor relations. To the best of our knowledge, re-ranking has not been used for writer identification/retrieval. A possible reason might be that publicly available benchmark datasets contain only few samples per writer which makes a re-ranking less promising. We show that a re-ranking step based on k-reciprocal nearest neighbor relationships is advantageous for writer identification, even if only a few samples per writer are available. We use these reciprocal relationships in two ways: encode them into new vectors, as originally proposed, or integrate them in terms of query-expansion. We show that both techniques outperform the baseline results in terms of mAP on three writer identification datasets.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have shown to achieve superior performance on image segmentation tasks. However, convolutional neural networks, operating as black-box systems, generally do not provide a reliable measure about the confidence of their decisions. This leads to various problems in industrial settings, amongst others, inadequate levels of trust from users in the model's outputs as well as a non-compliance with current policy guidelines (e.g., EU AI Strategy). To address these issues, we use uncertainty measures based on Monte-Carlo dropout in the context of a human-in-the-loop system to increase the system's transparency and performance. In particular, we demonstrate the benefits described above on a real-world multi-class image segmentation task of wear analysis in the machining industry. Following previous work, we show that the quality of a prediction correlates with the model's uncertainty. Additionally, we demonstrate that a multiple linear regression using the model's uncertainties as independent variables significantly explains the quality of a prediction (\(R^2=0.718\)). Within the uncertainty-based human-in-the-loop system, the multiple regression aims at identifying failed predictions on an image-level. The system utilizes a human expert to label these failed predictions manually. A simulation study demonstrates that the uncertainty-based human-in-the-loop system increases performance for different levels of human involvement in comparison to a random-based human-in-the-loop system. To ensure generalizability, we show that the presented approach achieves similar results on the publicly available Cityscapes dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a DNN-based system that detects multiple people from a single depth image. Our neural network processes a depth image and outputs a likelihood map in image coordinates, where each detection corresponds to a Gaussian-shaped local distribution, centered at the person's head. The likelihood map encodes both the number of detected people and their 2D image positions, and can be used to recover the 3D position of each person using the depth image and the camera calibration parameters. Our architecture is compact, using separated convolutions to increase performance, and runs in real-time with low budget GPUs. We use simulated data for initially training the network, followed by fine tuning with a relatively small amount of real data. We show this strategy to be effective, producing networks that generalize to work with scenes different from those used during training. We thoroughly compare our method against the existing state-of-the-art, including both classical and DNN-based solutions. Our method outperforms existing methods and can accurately detect people in scenes with significant occlusions.

- **Summary**: When smartphone cameras are used to take photos of digital screens, usually moire patterns result, severely degrading photo quality. In this paper, we design a wavelet-based dual-branch network (WDNet) with a spatial attention mechanism for image demoireing. Existing image restoration methods working in the RGB domain have difficulty in distinguishing moire patterns from true scene texture. Unlike these methods, our network removes moire patterns in the wavelet domain to separate the frequencies of moire patterns from the image content. The network combines dense convolution modules and dilated convolution modules supporting large receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we further show that WDNet generalizes to removing moire artifacts on non-screen images. Although designed for image demoireing, WDNet has been applied to two other low-levelvision tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art image deraining and derain-drop methods on the Rain100h and Raindrop800 data sets, respectively.

- **Summary**: Assigning consistent temporal identifiers to multiple moving objects in a video sequence is a challenging problem. A solution to that problem would have immediate ramifications in multiple object tracking and segmentation problems. We propose a strategy that treats the temporal identification task as a spatio-temporal clustering problem. We propose an unsupervised learning approach using a convolutional and fully connected autoencoder, which we call deep heterogeneous autoencoder, to learn discriminative features from segmentation masks and detection bounding boxes. We extract masks and their corresponding bounding boxes from a pretrained instance segmentation network and train the autoencoders jointly using task-dependent uncertainty weights to generate common latent features. We then construct constraints graphs that encourage associations among objects that satisfy a set of known temporal conditions. The feature vectors and the constraints graphs are then provided to the kmeans clustering algorithm to separate the corresponding data points in the latent space. We evaluate the performance of our method using challenging synthetic and real-world multiple-object video datasets. Our results show that our technique outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We introduce MosAIc, an interactive web app that allows users to find pairs of semantically related artworks that span different cultures, media, and millennia. To create this application, we introduce Conditional Image Retrieval (CIR) which combines visual similarity search with user supplied filters or "conditions". This technique allows one to find pairs of similar images that span distinct subsets of the image corpus. We provide a generic way to adapt existing image retrieval data-structures to this new domain and provide theoretical bounds on our approach's efficiency. To quantify the performance of CIR systems, we introduce new datasets for evaluating CIR methods and show that CIR performs non-parametric style transfer. Finally, we demonstrate that our CIR data-structures can identify "blind spots" in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) where they fail to properly model the true data distribution.

- **Summary**: Current deep learning based segmentation models often generalize poorly between domains due to insufficient training data. In real-world clinical applications, cross-domain image analysis tools are in high demand since medical images from different domains are often needed to achieve a precise diagnosis. An important example in radiology is generalizing from non-contrast CT to contrast enhanced CTs. Contrast enhanced CT scans at different phases are used to enhance certain pathologies or organs. Many existing cross-domain image-to-image translation models have been shown to improve cross-domain segmentation of large organs. However, such models lack the ability to preserve fine structures during the translation process, which is significant for many clinical applications, such as segmenting small calcified plaques in the aorta and pelvic arteries. In order to preserve fine structures during medical image translation, we propose a patch-based model using shared latent variables from a Gaussian mixture model. We compare our image translation framework to several state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain image translation and show our model does a better job preserving fine structures. The superior performance of our model is verified by performing two tasks with the translated images - detection and segmentation of aortic plaques and pancreas segmentation. We expect the utility of our framework will extend to other problems beyond segmentation due to the improved quality of the generated images and enhanced ability to preserve small structures.

- **Summary**: Although deep networks achieve strong accuracy on a range of computer vision benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible input perturbations fool the network. We present both theoretical and empirical analyses that connect the adversarial robustness of a model to the number of tasks that it is trained on. Experiments on two datasets show that attack difficulty increases as the number of target tasks increase. Moreover, our results suggest that when models are trained on multiple tasks at once, they become more robust to adversarial attacks on individual tasks. While adversarial defense remains an open challenge, our results suggest that deep networks are vulnerable partly because they are trained on too few tasks.

- **Summary**: People often create art by following an artistic workflow involving multiple stages that inform the overall design. If an artist wishes to modify an earlier decision, significant work may be required to propagate this new decision forward to the final artwork. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a generative model that follows a given artistic workflow, enabling both multi-stage image generation as well as multi-stage image editing of an existing piece of art. Furthermore, for the editing scenario, we introduce an optimization process along with learning-based regularization to ensure the edited image produced by the model closely aligns with the originally provided image. Qualitative and quantitative results on three different artistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on both image generation and editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Conventional CNNs for texture synthesis consist of a sequence of (de)-convolution and up/down-sampling layers, where each layer operates locally and lacks the ability to capture the long-term structural dependency required by texture synthesis. Thus, they often simply enlarge the input texture, rather than perform reasonable synthesis. As a compromise, many recent methods sacrifice generalizability by training and testing on the same single (or fixed set of) texture image(s), resulting in huge re-training time costs for unseen images. In this work, based on the discovery that the assembling/stitching operation in traditional texture synthesis is analogous to a transposed convolution operation, we propose a novel way of using transposed convolution operation. Specifically, we directly treat the whole encoded feature map of the input texture as transposed convolution filters and the features' self-similarity map, which captures the auto-correlation information, as input to the transposed convolution. Such a design allows our framework, once trained, to be generalizable to perform synthesis of unseen textures with a single forward pass in nearly real-time. Our method achieves state-of-the-art texture synthesis quality based on various metrics. While self-similarity helps preserve the input textures' regular structural patterns, our framework can also take random noise maps for irregular input textures instead of self-similarity maps as transposed convolution inputs. It allows to get more diverse results as well as generate arbitrarily large texture outputs by directly sampling large noise maps in a single pass as well.

- **Summary**: Incorporating multiple camera views for detection alleviates the impact of occlusions in crowded scenes. In a multiview system, we need to answer two important questions when dealing with ambiguities that arise from occlusions. First, how should we aggregate cues from the multiple views? Second, how should we aggregate unreliable 2D and 3D spatial information that has been tainted by occlusions? To address these questions, we propose a novel multiview detection system, MVDet. For multiview aggregation, existing methods combine anchor box features from the image plane, which potentially limits performance due to inaccurate anchor box shapes and sizes. In contrast, we take an anchor-free approach to aggregate multiview information by projecting feature maps onto the ground plane (bird's eye view). To resolve any remaining spatial ambiguity, we apply large kernel convolutions on the ground plane feature map and infer locations from detection peaks. Our entire model is end-to-end learnable and achieves 88.2% MODA on the standard Wildtrack dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 14.1%. We also provide detailed analysis of MVDet on a newly introduced synthetic dataset, MultiviewX, which allows us to control the level of occlusion. Code and MultiviewX dataset are available at https://github.com/hou-yz/MVDet.

- **Summary**: Embodied AI has been recently gaining attention as it aims to foster the development of autonomous and intelligent agents. In this paper, we devise a novel embodied setting in which an agent needs to explore a previously unknown environment while recounting what it sees during the path. In this context, the agent needs to navigate the environment driven by an exploration goal, select proper moments for description, and output natural language descriptions of relevant objects and scenes. Our model integrates a novel self-supervised exploration module with penalty, and a fully-attentive captioning model for explanation. Also, we investigate different policies for selecting proper moments for explanation, driven by information coming from both the environment and the navigation. Experiments are conducted on photorealistic environments from the Matterport3D dataset and investigate the navigation and explanation capabilities of the agent as well as the role of their interactions.

- **Summary**: Typical machine learning approaches require centralized data for model training, which may not be possible where restrictions on data sharing are in place due to, for instance, privacy and gradient protection. The recently proposed Federated Learning (FL) framework allows learning a shared model collaboratively without data being centralized or shared among data owners. However, we show in this paper that the generalization ability of the joint model is poor on Non-Independent and Non-Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data, particularly when the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) strategy is used due to the weight divergence phenomenon. Hence, we propose a novel boosting algorithm for FL to address both the generalization and gradient leakage issues, as well as achieve faster convergence in gradient-based optimization. In addition, a secure gradient sharing protocol using Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Differential Privacy (DP) is introduced to defend against gradient leakage attack and avoid pairwise encryption that is not scalable. We demonstrate the proposed Federated Boosting (FedBoosting) method achieves noticeable improvements in both prediction accuracy and run-time efficiency in a visual text recognition task on public benchmark.



### COBE: Contextualized Object Embeddings from Narrated Instructional Video

- **Summary**: Many objects in the real world undergo dramatic variations in visual appearance. For example, a tomato may be red or green, sliced or chopped, fresh or fried, liquid or solid. Training a single detector to accurately recognize tomatoes in all these different states is challenging. On the other hand, contextual cues (e.g., the presence of a knife, a cutting board, a strainer or a pan) are often strongly indicative of how the object appears in the scene. Recognizing such contextual cues is useful not only to improve the accuracy of object detection or to determine the state of the object, but also to understand its functional properties and to infer ongoing or upcoming human-object interactions. A fully-supervised approach to recognizing object states and their contexts in the real-world is unfortunately marred by the long-tailed, open-ended distribution of the data, which would effectively require massive amounts of annotations to capture the appearance of objects in all their different forms. Instead of relying on manually-labeled data for this task, we propose a new framework for learning Contextualized OBject Embeddings (COBE) from automatically-transcribed narrations of instructional videos. We leverage the semantic and compositional structure of language by training a visual detector to predict a contextualized word embedding of the object and its associated narration. This enables the learning of an object representation where concepts relate according to a semantic language metric. Our experiments show that our detector learns to predict a rich variety of contextual object information, and that it is highly effective in the settings of few-shot and zero-shot learning.

- **Summary**: Successfully training Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with a hierarchy of discrete latent variables remains an area of active research.   Vector-Quantised VAEs are a powerful approach to discrete VAEs, but naive hierarchical extensions can be unstable when training. Leveraging insights from classical methods of inference we introduce \textit{Relaxed-Responsibility Vector-Quantisation}, a novel way to parameterise discrete latent variables, a refinement of relaxed Vector-Quantisation that gives better performance and more stable training. This enables a novel approach to hierarchical discrete variational autoencoders with numerous layers of latent variables (here up to 32) that we train end-to-end. Within hierarchical probabilistic deep generative models with discrete latent variables trained end-to-end, we achieve state-of-the-art bits-per-dim results for various standard datasets. % Unlike discrete VAEs with a single layer of latent variables, we can produce samples by ancestral sampling: it is not essential to train a second autoregressive generative model over the learnt latent representations to then sample from and then decode. % Moreover, that latter approach in these deep hierarchical models would require thousands of forward passes to generate a single sample. Further, we observe different layers of our model become associated with different aspects of the data.

- **Summary**: We present Generalized Histogram Thresholding (GHT), a simple, fast, and effective technique for histogram-based image thresholding. GHT works by performing approximate maximum a posteriori estimation of a mixture of Gaussians with appropriate priors. We demonstrate that GHT subsumes three classic thresholding techniques as special cases: Otsu's method, Minimum Error Thresholding (MET), and weighted percentile thresholding. GHT thereby enables the continuous interpolation between those three algorithms, which allows thresholding accuracy to be improved significantly. GHT also provides a clarifying interpretation of the common practice of coarsening a histogram's bin width during thresholding. We show that GHT outperforms or matches the performance of all algorithms on a recent challenge for handwritten document image binarization (including deep neural networks trained to produce per-pixel binarizations), and can be implemented in a dozen lines of code or as a trivial modification to Otsu's method or MET.

- **Summary**: The existing research in action recognition is mostly focused on high-quality videos where the action is distinctly visible. In real-world surveillance environments, the actions in videos are captured at a wide range of resolutions. Most activities occur at a distance with a small resolution and recognizing such activities is a challenging problem. In this work, we focus on recognizing tiny actions in videos. We introduce a benchmark dataset, TinyVIRAT, which contains natural low-resolution activities. The actions in TinyVIRAT videos have multiple labels and they are extracted from surveillance videos which makes them realistic and more challenging. We propose a novel method for recognizing tiny actions in videos which utilizes a progressive generative approach to improve the quality of low-resolution actions. The proposed method also consists of a weakly trained attention mechanism which helps in focusing on the activity regions in the video. We perform extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed TinyVIRAT dataset and observe that the proposed method significantly improves the action recognition performance over baselines. We also evaluate the proposed approach on synthetically resized action recognition datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results when compared with existing methods. The dataset and code is publicly available at https://github.com/UgurDemir/Tiny-VIRAT.

- **Summary**: In this work, the case of semantic segmentation on a small image dataset (simulated by 1000 randomly selected images from PASCAL VOC 2012), where only weak supervision signals (scribbles from user interaction) are available is studied. Especially, to tackle the problem of limited data annotations in image segmentation, transferring different pre-trained models and CRF based methods are applied to enhance the segmentation performance. To this end, RotNet, DeeperCluster, and Semi&Weakly Supervised Learning (SWSL) pre-trained models are transferred and finetuned in a DeepLab-v2 baseline, and dense CRF is applied both as a post-processing and loss regularization technique. The results of my study show that, on this small dataset, using a pre-trained ResNet50 SWSL model gives results that are 7.4% better than applying an ImageNet pre-trained model; moreover, for the case of training on the full PASCAL VOC 2012 training data, this pre-training approach increases the mIoU results by almost 4%. On the other hand, dense CRF is shown to be very effective as well, enhancing the results both as a loss regularization technique in weakly supervised training and as a post-processing tool.

- **Summary**: Developing algorithms that are able to generalize to a novel task given only a few labeled examples represents a fundamental challenge in closing the gap between machine- and human-level performance. The core of human cognition lies in the structured, reusable concepts that help us to rapidly adapt to new tasks and provide reasoning behind our decisions. However, existing meta-learning methods learn complex representations across prior labeled tasks without imposing any structure on the learned representations. Here we propose COMET, a meta-learning method that improves generalization ability by learning to learn along human-interpretable concept dimensions. Instead of learning a joint unstructured metric space, COMET learns mappings of high-level concepts into semi-structured metric spaces, and effectively combines the outputs of independent concept learners. We evaluate our model on few-shot tasks from diverse domains, including fine-grained image classification, document categorization and cell type annotation on a novel dataset from a biological domain developed in our work. COMET significantly outperforms strong meta-learning baselines, achieving 6-15% relative improvement on the most challenging 1-shot learning tasks, while unlike existing methods providing interpretations behind the model's predictions.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the process of designing an automatic multi-sensor drone detection system. Besides the common video and audio sensors, the system also includes a thermal infrared camera, which is shown to be a feasible solution to the drone detection task. Even with slightly lower resolution, the performance is just as good as a camera in visible range. The detector performance as a function of the sensor-to-target distance is also investigated. In addition, using sensor fusion, the system is made more robust than the individual sensors, helping to reduce false detections. To counteract the lack of public datasets, a novel video dataset containing 650 annotated infrared and visible videos of drones, birds, airplanes and helicopters is also presented (https://github.com/DroneDetectionThesis/Drone-detection-dataset). The database is complemented with an audio dataset of the classes drones, helicopters and background noise.

- **Summary**: Medical Image Retrieval (MIR) helps doctors quickly find similar patients' data, which can considerably aid the diagnosis process. MIR is becoming increasingly helpful due to the wide use of digital imaging modalities and the growth of the medical image repositories. However, the popularity of various digital imaging modalities in hospitals also poses several challenges to MIR. Usually, one image retrieval model is only trained to handle images from one modality or one source. When there are needs to retrieve medical images from several sources or domains, multiple retrieval models need to be maintained, which is cost ineffective. In this paper, we study an important but unexplored task: how to train one MIR model that is applicable to medical images from multiple domains? Simply fusing the training data from multiple domains cannot solve this problem because some domains become over-fit sooner when trained together using existing methods. Therefore, we propose to distill the knowledge in multiple specialist MIR models into a single multi-domain MIR model via universal embedding to solve this problem. Using skin disease, x-ray, and retina image datasets, we validate that our proposed universal model can effectively accomplish multi-domain MIR.

- **Summary**: A central challenge in developing versatile machine learning systems is catastrophic forgetting: a model trained on tasks in sequence will suffer significant performance drops on earlier tasks. Despite the ubiquity of catastrophic forgetting, there is limited understanding of the underlying process and its causes. In this paper, we address this important knowledge gap, investigating how forgetting affects representations in neural network models. Through representational analysis techniques, we find that deeper layers are disproportionately the source of forgetting. Supporting this, a study of methods to mitigate forgetting illustrates that they act to stabilize deeper layers. These insights enable the development of an analytic argument and empirical picture relating the degree of forgetting to representational similarity between tasks. Consistent with this picture, we observe maximal forgetting occurs for task sequences with intermediate similarity. We perform empirical studies on the standard split CIFAR-10 setup and also introduce a novel CIFAR-100 based task approximating realistic input distribution shift.

- **Summary**: Road intersections data have been used across different geospatial applications and analysis. The road network datasets dating from pre-GIS years are only available in the form of historical printed maps. Before they can be analyzed by a GIS software, they need to be scanned and transformed into the usable vector-based format. Due to the great bulk of scanned historical maps, automated methods of transforming them into digital datasets need to be employed. Frequently, this process is based on computer vision algorithms. However, low conversion accuracy for low quality and visually complex maps and setting optimal parameters are the two challenges of using those algorithms. In this paper, we employed the standard paradigm of using deep convolutional neural network for object detection task named region-based CNN for automatically identifying road intersections in scanned historical USGS maps of several U.S. cities. We have found that the algorithm showed higher conversion accuracy for the double line cartographic representations of the road maps than the single line ones. Also, compared to the majority of traditional computer vision algorithms RCNN provides more accurate extraction. Finally, the results show that the amount of errors in the detection outputs is sensitive to complexity and blurriness of the maps as well as the number of distinct RGB combinations within them.

- **Summary**: Recently, much progress has been made in unsupervised denoising learning. However, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal and/or degradation model, which limits their practical performance. How to construct an optimal criterion for unsupervised denoising learning without any prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward answering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised denoising learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has favorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the information of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction. Furthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical implementation, we prove that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same solution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw depth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with supervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while having better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise and realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better perceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods. Besides, it shows remarkable superiority in harsh practical conditions with complex noise, e.g., raw depth images. Code is available at https://github.com/wangweiSJTU/OTUR.

- **Summary**: Furnishing and rendering indoor scenes has been a long-standing task for interior design, where artists create a conceptual design for the space, build a 3D model of the space, decorate, and then perform rendering. Although the task is important, it is tedious and requires tremendous effort. In this paper, we introduce a new problem of domain-specific indoor scene image synthesis, namely neural scene decoration. Given a photograph of an empty indoor space and a list of decorations with layout determined by user, we aim to synthesize a new image of the same space with desired furnishing and decorations. Neural scene decoration can be applied to create conceptual interior designs in a simple yet effective manner. Our attempt to this research problem is a novel scene generation architecture that transforms an empty scene and an object layout into a realistic furnished scene photograph. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method by comparing it with conditional image synthesis baselines built upon prevailing image translation approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. We conduct extensive experiments to further validate the plausibility and aesthetics of our generated scenes. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/hkust-vgd/neural_scene_decoration}.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proved to have excellent performance on unsupervised domain adaption (UDA). However, recent work shows that DNNs perform poorly when being attacked by adversarial samples, where these attacks are implemented by simply adding small disturbances to the original images. Although plenty of work has focused on this, as far as we know, there is no systematic research on the robustness of unsupervised domain adaption model. Hence, we discuss the robustness of unsupervised domain adaption against adversarial attacking for the first time. We benchmark various settings of adversarial attack and defense in domain adaption, and propose a cross domain attack method based on pseudo label. Most importantly, we analyze the impact of different datasets, models, attack methods and defense methods. Directly, our work proves the limited robustness of unsupervised domain adaptation model, and we hope our work may facilitate the community to pay more attention to improve the robustness of the model against attacking.

- **Summary**: There is a warning light for the loss of plant habitats worldwide that entails concerted efforts to conserve plant biodiversity. Thus, plant species classification is of crucial importance to address this environmental challenge. In recent years, there is a considerable increase in the number of studies related to plant taxonomy. While some researchers try to improve their recognition performance using novel approaches, others concentrate on computational optimization for their framework. In addition, a few studies are diving into feature extraction to gain significantly in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we propose an effective method for the leaf recognition problem. In our proposed approach, a leaf goes through some pre-processing to extract its refined color image, vein image, xy-projection histogram, handcrafted shape, texture features, and Fourier descriptors. These attributes are then transformed into a better representation by neural network-based encoders before a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different leaves. Overall, our approach performs a state-of-the-art result on the Flavia leaf dataset, achieving the accuracy of 99.58\% on test sets under random 10-fold cross-validation and bypassing the previous methods. We also release our codes (Scripts are available at https://github.com/dinhvietcuong1996/LeafRecognition) for contributing to the research community in the leaf classification problem.

- **Summary**: Existing video copy detection methods generally measure video similarity based on spatial similarities between key frames, neglecting the latent similarity in temporal dimension, so that the video similarity is biased towards spatial information. There are methods modeling unified video similarity in an end-to-end way, but losing detailed partial alignment information, which causes the incapability of copy segments localization. To address the above issues, we propose the Video Similarity and Alignment Learning (VSAL) approach, which jointly models spatial similarity, temporal similarity and partial alignment. To mitigate the spatial similarity bias, we model the temporal similarity as the mask map predicted from frame-level spatial similarity, where each element indicates the probability of frame pair lying right on the partial alignments. To further localize partial copies, the step map is learned from the spatial similarity where the elements indicate extending directions of the current partial alignments on the spatial-temporal similarity map. Obtained from the mask map, the start points extend out into partial optimal alignments following instructions of the step map. With the similarity and alignment learning strategy, VSAL achieves the state-of-the-art F1-score on VCDB core dataset. Furthermore, we construct a new benchmark of partial video copy detection and localization by adding new segment-level annotations for FIVR-200k dataset, where VSAL also achieves the best performance, verifying its effectiveness in more challenging situations.

- **Summary**: Human pose information is a critical component in many downstream image processing tasks, such as activity recognition and motion tracking. Likewise, a pose estimator for the illustrated character domain would provide a valuable prior for assistive content creation tasks, such as reference pose retrieval and automatic character animation. But while modern data-driven techniques have substantially improved pose estimation performance on natural images, little work has been done for illustrations. In our work, we bridge this domain gap by efficiently transfer-learning from both domain-specific and task-specific source models. Additionally, we upgrade and expand an existing illustrated pose estimation dataset, and introduce two new datasets for classification and segmentation subtasks. We then apply the resultant state-of-the-art character pose estimator to solve the novel task of pose-guided illustration retrieval. All data, models, and code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a key role in computer-aided screening, diagnosis, and treatment of various cardiovascular and ophthalmic diseases. Recently, deep learning-based retinal vessel segmentation algorithms have achieved remarkable performance. However, due to the domain shift problem, the performance of these algorithms often degrades when they are applied to new data that is different from the training data. Manually labeling new data for each test domain is often a time-consuming and laborious task. In this work, we explore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using entropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a segmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no annotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based adversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the objective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new transfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability of the deep network. It normalizes the features of each domain separately to compensate for the domain distribution gap. Besides, it also adaptively selects those feature channels that are more transferable between domains, thus further enhancing the generalization performance of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three regular fundus image datasets and an ultra-widefield fundus image dataset, and the results show that our approach yields significant performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Pose-guided person image synthesis aims to synthesize person images by transforming reference images into target poses. In this paper, we observe that the commonly used spatial transformation blocks have complementary advantages. We propose a novel model by combining the attention operation with the flow-based operation. Our model not only takes the advantage of the attention operation to generate accurate target structures but also uses the flow-based operation to sample realistic source textures. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model. Meanwhile, comprehensive ablation studies verify our hypotheses and show the efficacy of the proposed modules. Besides, additional experiments on the portrait image editing task demonstrate the versatility of the proposed combination.



### Specialize and Fuse: Pyramidal Output Representation for Semantic Segmentation

- **Summary**: We present a novel pyramidal output representation to ensure parsimony with our "specialize and fuse" process for semantic segmentation. A pyramidal "output" representation consists of coarse-to-fine levels, where each level is "specialize" in a different class distribution (e.g., more stuff than things classes at coarser levels). Two types of pyramidal outputs (i.e., unity and semantic pyramid) are "fused" into the final semantic output, where the unity pyramid indicates unity-cells (i.e., all pixels in such cell share the same semantic label). The process ensures parsimony by predicting a relatively small number of labels for unity-cells (e.g., a large cell of grass) to build the final semantic output. In addition to the "output" representation, we design a coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate the "features" representation from different levels. We validate the effectiveness of each key module in our method through comprehensive ablation studies. Finally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used semantic segmentation datasets -- ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal-Context.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel universal detector for detecting images generated by using CNNs. In this paper, properties of checkerboard artifacts in CNN-generated images are considered, and the spectrum of images is enhanced in accordance with the properties. Next, a classifier is trained by using the enhanced spectrums to judge a query image to be a CNN-generated ones or not. In addition, an ensemble of the proposed detector with emphasized spectrums and a conventional detector is proposed to improve the performance of these methods. In an experiment, the proposed ensemble is demonstrated to outperform a state-of-the-art method under some conditions.

- **Summary**: Most existing neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are dedicated to and evaluated by the downstream tasks, e.g., image classification in computer vision. However, extensive experiments have shown that, prominent neural architectures, such as ResNet in computer vision and LSTM in natural language processing, are generally good at extracting patterns from the input data and perform well on different downstream tasks. In this paper, we attempt to answer two fundamental questions related to NAS. (1) Is it necessary to use the performance of specific downstream tasks to evaluate and search for good neural architectures? (2) Can we perform NAS effectively and efficiently while being agnostic to the downstream tasks? To answer these questions, we propose a novel and generic NAS framework, termed Generic NAS (GenNAS). GenNAS does not use task-specific labels but instead adopts regression on a set of manually designed synthetic signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a self-supervised regression task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of an architecture to capture and transform the input signal patterns, and allow more sufficient usage of training samples. Extensive experiments across 13 CNN search spaces and one NLP space demonstrate the remarkable efficiency of GenNAS using regression, in terms of both evaluating the neural architectures (quantified by the ranking correlation Spearman's rho between the approximated performances and the downstream task performances) and the convergence speed for training (within a few seconds).



### FPB: Feature Pyramid Branch for Person Re-Identification

- **Summary**: High performance person Re-Identification (Re-ID) requires the model to focus on both global silhouette and local details of pedestrian. To extract such more representative features, an effective way is to exploit deep models with multiple branches. However, most multi-branch based methods implemented by duplication of part backbone structure normally lead to severe increase of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Feature Pyramid Branch (FPB) to extract features from different layers of networks and aggregate them in a bidirectional pyramid structure. Cooperated by attention modules and our proposed cross orthogonality regularization, FPB significantly prompts the performance of backbone network by only introducing less than 1.5M extra parameters. Extensive experimental results on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed FPB based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods with obvious margin as well as much less model complexity. FPB borrows the idea of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from prevailing object detection methods. To our best knowledge, it is the first successful application of similar structure in person Re-ID tasks, which empirically proves that pyramid network as affiliated branch could be a potential structure in related feature embedding models.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a novel framework for video inpainting by adopting an internal learning strategy. Unlike previous methods that use optical flow for cross-frame context propagation to inpaint unknown regions, we show that this can be achieved implicitly by fitting a convolutional neural network to known regions. Moreover, to handle challenging sequences with ambiguous backgrounds or long-term occlusion, we design two regularization terms to preserve high-frequency details and long-term temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art inpainting quality quantitatively and qualitatively. We further extend the proposed method to another challenging task: learning to remove an object from a video giving a single object mask in only one frame in a 4K video.

- **Summary**: Gaussian curvature is an important geometric property of surfaces, which has been used broadly in mathematical modeling. Due to the full nonlinearity of the Gaussian curvature, efficient numerical methods for models based on it are uncommon in literature. In this article, we propose an operator-splitting method for a general Gaussian curvature model. In our method, we decouple the full nonlinearity of Gaussian curvature from differential operators by introducing two matrix- and vector-valued functions. The optimization problem is then converted into the search for the steady state solution of a time dependent PDE system. The above PDE system is well-suited to time discretization by operator splitting, the sub-problems encountered at each fractional step having either a closed form solution or being solvable by efficient algorithms. The proposed method is not sensitive to the choice of parameters, its efficiency and performances being demonstrated via systematic experiments on surface smoothing and image denoising.

- **Summary**: Graph neural networks are increasingly becoming the go-to approach in various fields such as computer vision, computational biology and chemistry, where data are naturally explained by graphs. However, unlike traditional convolutional neural networks, deep graph networks do not necessarily yield better performance than shallow graph networks. This behavior usually stems from the over-smoothing phenomenon. In this work, we propose a family of architectures to control this behavior by design. Our networks are motivated by numerical methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and as such, their behavior can be explained by similar analysis. Moreover, as we demonstrate using an extensive set of experiments, our PDE-motivated networks can generalize and be effective for various types of problems from different fields. Our architectures obtain better or on par with the current state-of-the-art results for problems that are typically approached using different architectures.

- **Summary**: We present MedicDeepLabv3+, a convolutional neural network that is the first completely automatic method to segment cerebral hemispheres in magnetic resonance (MR) volumes of rats with lesions. MedicDeepLabv3+ improves the state-of-the-art DeepLabv3+ with an advanced decoder, incorporating spatial attention layers and additional skip connections that, as we show in our experiments, lead to more precise segmentations. MedicDeepLabv3+ requires no MR image preprocessing, such as bias-field correction or registration to a template, produces segmentations in less than a second, and its GPU memory requirements can be adjusted based on the available resources. We optimized MedicDeepLabv3+ and six other state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (DeepLabv3+, UNet, HighRes3DNet, V-Net, VoxResNet, Demon) on a heterogeneous training set comprised by MR volumes from 11 cohorts acquired at different lesion stages. Then, we evaluated the trained models and two approaches specifically designed for rodent MRI skull stripping (RATS and RBET) on a large dataset of 655 MR rat brain volumes. In our experiments, MedicDeepLabv3+ outperformed the other methods, yielding an average Dice coefficient of 0.952 and 0.944 in the brain and contralateral hemisphere regions. Additionally, we show that despite limiting the GPU memory and the training data, our MedicDeepLabv3+ also provided satisfactory segmentations. In conclusion, our method, publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/MedicDeepLabv3Plus, yielded excellent results in multiple scenarios, demonstrating its capability to reduce human workload in rat neuroimaging studies.

- **Summary**: Achieving backward compatibility when rolling out new models can highly reduce costs or even bypass feature re-encoding of existing gallery images for in-production visual retrieval systems. Previous related works usually leverage losses used in knowledge distillation which can cause performance degradations or not guarantee compatibility. To address these issues, we propose a general framework called Learning Compatible Embeddings (LCE) which is applicable for both cross model compatibility and compatible training in direct/forward/backward manners. Our compatibility is achieved by aligning class centers between models directly or via a transformation, and restricting more compact intra-class distributions for the new model. Experiments are conducted in extensive scenarios such as changes of training dataset, loss functions, network architectures as well as feature dimensions, and demonstrate that LCE efficiently enables model compatibility with marginal sacrifices of accuracies. The code will be available at https://github.com/IrvingMeng/LCE.

- **Summary**: Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, most of the existing works focus on supervised learning which requiring a large number of annotated action sequences that are often expensive to collect. We investigate unsupervised representation learning for skeleton action recognition, and design a novel skeleton cloud colorization technique that is capable of learning skeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. Specifically, we represent a skeleton action sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and colorize each point in the cloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original (unannotated) skeleton sequence. Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud, we design an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively. We evaluate our skeleton cloud colorization approach with action classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and fully-supervised settings. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NW-UCLA datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised and semi-supervised 3D action recognition methods by large margins, and it achieves competitive performance in supervised 3D action recognition as well.

- **Summary**: The popularity and promotion of depth maps have brought new vigor and vitality into salient object detection (SOD), and a mass of RGB-D SOD algorithms have been proposed, mainly concentrating on how to better integrate cross-modality features from RGB image and depth map. For the cross-modality interaction in feature encoder, existing methods either indiscriminately treat RGB and depth modalities, or only habitually utilize depth cues as auxiliary information of the RGB branch. Different from them, we reconsider the status of two modalities and propose a novel Cross-modality Discrepant Interaction Network (CDINet) for RGB-D SOD, which differentially models the dependence of two modalities according to the feature representations of different layers. To this end, two components are designed to implement the effective cross-modality interaction: 1) the RGB-induced Detail Enhancement (RDE) module leverages RGB modality to enhance the details of the depth features in low-level encoder stage. 2) the Depth-induced Semantic Enhancement (DSE) module transfers the object positioning and internal consistency of depth features to the RGB branch in high-level encoder stage. Furthermore, we also design a Dense Decoding Reconstruction (DDR) structure, which constructs a semantic block by combining multi-level encoder features to upgrade the skip connection in the feature decoding. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our network outperforms $15$ state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: While classic video anomaly detection (VAD) requires labeled normal videos for training, emerging unsupervised VAD (UVAD) aims to discover anomalies directly from fully unlabeled videos. However, existing UVAD methods still rely on shallow models to perform detection or initialization, and they are evidently inferior to classic VAD methods. This paper proposes a full deep neural network (DNN) based solution that can realize highly effective UVAD. First, we, for the first time, point out that deep reconstruction can be surprisingly effective for UVAD, which inspires us to unveil a property named "normality advantage", i.e., normal events will enjoy lower reconstruction loss when DNN learns to reconstruct unlabeled videos. With this property, we propose Localization based Reconstruction (LBR) as a strong UVAD baseline and a solid foundation of our solution. Second, we propose a novel self-paced refinement (SPR) scheme, which is synthesized into LBR to conduct UVAD. Unlike ordinary self-paced learning that injects more samples in an easy-to-hard manner, the proposed SPR scheme gradually drops samples so that suspicious anomalies can be removed from the learning process. In this way, SPR consolidates normality advantage and enables better UVAD in a more proactive way. Finally, we further design a variant solution that explicitly takes the motion cues into account. The solution evidently enhances the UVAD performance, and it sometimes even surpasses the best classic VAD methods. Experiments show that our solution not only significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a wide margin (5% to 9% AUROC), but also enables UVAD to catch up with the mainstream performance of classic VAD.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning of depth and ego-motion from unlabeled monocular video has acquired promising results and drawn extensive attention. Most existing methods jointly train the depth and pose networks by photometric consistency of adjacent frames based on the principle of structure-from-motion (SFM). However, the coupling relationship of the depth and pose networks seriously influences the learning performance, and the re-projection relations is sensitive to scale ambiguity, especially for pose learning. In this paper, we aim to improve the depth-pose learning performance without the auxiliary tasks and address the above issues by alternative training each task and incorporating the epipolar geometric constraints into the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) based point clouds match process. Distinct from jointly training the depth and pose networks, our key idea is to better utilize the mutual dependency of these two tasks by alternatively training each network with respective losses while fixing the other. We also design a log-scale 3D structural consistency loss to put more emphasis on the smaller depth values during training. To makes the optimization easier, we further incorporate the epipolar geometry into the ICP based learning process for pose learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks datasets indicate the superiority of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Incorporating boundaries of the imaging object as a priori information to imaging algorithms can significantly improve the performance of electromagnetic medical imaging systems. To avoid overly complicating the system by using different sensors and the adverse effect of the subject's movement, a learning-based method is proposed to estimate the boundary (external contour) of the imaged object using the same electromagnetic imaging data. While imaging techniques may discard the reflection coefficients for being dominant and uninformative for imaging, these parameters are made use of for boundary detection. The learned model is verified through independent clinical human trials by using a head imaging system with a 16-element antenna array that works across the band 0.7-1.6 GHz. The evaluation demonstrated that the model achieves average dissimilarity of 0.012 in Hu-moment while detecting head boundary. The model enables fast scan and image creation while eliminating the need for additional devices for accurate boundary estimation.

- **Summary**: Signature verification has been one of the major researched areas in the field of computer vision. Many financial and legal organizations use signature verification as access control and authentication. Signature images are not rich in texture; however, they have much vital geometrical information. Through this work, we have proposed a signature verification methodology that is simple yet effective. The technique presented in this paper harnesses the geometrical features of a signature image like center, isolated points, connected components, etc., and with the power of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier, classifies the signature image based on their geometrical features. Publicly available dataset MCYT, BHSig260 (contains the image of two regional languages Bengali and Hindi) has been used in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. We have received a lower Equal Error Rate (EER) on MCYT 100 dataset and higher accuracy on the BHSig260 dataset.

- **Summary**: Multi-label learning is an emerging extension of the multi-class classification where an image contains multiple labels. Not only acquiring a clean and fully labeled dataset in multi-label learning is extremely expensive, but also many of the actual labels are corrupted or missing due to the automated or non-expert annotation techniques. Noisy label data decrease the prediction performance drastically. In this paper, we propose a novel Gold Asymmetric Loss Correction with Single-Label Regulators (GALC-SLR) that operates robust against noisy labels. GALC-SLR estimates the noise confusion matrix using single-label samples, then constructs an asymmetric loss correction via estimated confusion matrix to avoid overfitting to the noisy labels. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art original asymmetric loss multi-label classifier under all corruption levels, showing mean average precision improvement up to 28.67% on a real world dataset of MS-COCO, yielding a better generalization of the unseen data and increased prediction performance.

- **Summary**: Most current image captioning systems focus on describing general image content, and lack background knowledge to deeply understand the image, such as exact named entities or concrete events. In this work, we focus on the entity-aware news image captioning task which aims to generate informative captions by leveraging the associated news articles to provide background knowledge about the target image. However, due to the length of news articles, previous works only employ news articles at the coarse article or sentence level, which are not fine-grained enough to refine relevant events and choose named entities accurately. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Information Concentrated Entity-aware news image CAPtioning (ICECAP) model, which progressively concentrates on relevant textual information within the corresponding news article from the sentence level to the word level. Our model first creates coarse concentration on relevant sentences using a cross-modality retrieval model and then generates captions by further concentrating on relevant words within the sentences. Extensive experiments on both BreakingNews and GoodNews datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms other state-of-the-arts. The code of ICECAP is publicly available at https://github.com/HAWLYQ/ICECAP.

- **Summary**: For an image with multiple scene texts, different people may be interested in different text information. Current text-aware image captioning models are not able to generate distinctive captions according to various information needs. To explore how to generate personalized text-aware captions, we define a new challenging task, namely Question-controlled Text-aware Image Captioning (Qc-TextCap). With questions as control signals, this task requires models to understand questions, find related scene texts and describe them together with objects fluently in human language. Based on two existing text-aware captioning datasets, we automatically construct two datasets, ControlTextCaps and ControlVizWiz to support the task. We propose a novel Geometry and Question Aware Model (GQAM). GQAM first applies a Geometry-informed Visual Encoder to fuse region-level object features and region-level scene text features with considering spatial relationships. Then, we design a Question-guided Encoder to select the most relevant visual features for each question. Finally, GQAM generates a personalized text-aware caption with a Multimodal Decoder. Our model achieves better captioning performance and question answering ability than carefully designed baselines on both two datasets. With questions as control signals, our model generates more informative and diverse captions than the state-of-the-art text-aware captioning model. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/HAWLYQ/Qc-TextCap.

- **Summary**: Existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation, which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency, termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality. Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to minimize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones, which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship. Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student networks with different compression rates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO.

- **Summary**: We unveil a long-standing problem in the prevailing co-saliency detection systems: there is indeed inconsistency between training and testing. Constructing a high-quality co-saliency detection dataset involves time-consuming and labor-intensive pixel-level labeling, which has forced most recent works to rely instead on semantic segmentation or saliency detection datasets for training. However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence of multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious variations and inherent biases learned by models. To tackle this, we introduce the idea of counterfactual training through context adjustment and propose a "cost-free" group-cut-paste (GCP) procedure to leverage off-the-shelf images and synthesize new samples. Following GCP, we collect a novel dataset called Context Adjustment Training (CAT). CAT consists of 33,500 images, which is four times larger than the current co-saliency detection datasets. All samples are automatically annotated with high-quality mask annotations, object categories, and edge maps. Extensive experiments on recent benchmarks are conducted, show that CAT can improve various state-of-the-art models by a large margin (5% ~ 25%). We hope that the scale, diversity, and quality of our dataset can benefit researchers in this area and beyond. Our dataset will be publicly accessible through our project page.

- **Summary**: Document layout analysis (DLA) aims to divide a document image into different types of regions. DLA plays an important role in the document content understanding and information extraction systems. Exploring a method that can use less data for effective training contributes to the development of DLA. We consider a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) collaborative intelligence in the DLA. Our approach was inspired by the fact that the HITL push the model to learn from the unknown problems by adding a small amount of data based on knowledge. The HITL select key samples by using confidence. However, using confidence to find key samples is not suitable for DLA tasks. We propose the Key Samples Selection (KSS) method to find key samples in high-level tasks (semantic segmentation) more accurately through agent collaboration, effectively reducing costs. Once selected, these key samples are passed to human beings for active labeling, then the model will be updated with the labeled samples. Hence, we revisited the learning system from reinforcement learning and designed a sample-based agent update strategy, which effectively improves the agent's ability to accept new samples. It achieves significant improvement results in two benchmarks (DSSE-200 (from 77.1% to 86.3%) and CS-150 (from 88.0% to 95.6%)) by using 10% of labeled data.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud analysis has drawn a lot of research attention due to its wide applications. However, collecting massive labelled 3D point cloud data is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This calls for data-efficient learning methods. In this work we propose PointDisc, a point discriminative learning method to leverage self-supervisions for data-efficient 3D point cloud classification and segmentation. PointDisc imposes a novel point discrimination loss on the middle and global level features produced by the backbone network. This point discrimination loss enforces learned features to be consistent with points belonging to the corresponding local shape region and inconsistent with randomly sampled noisy points. We conduct extensive experiments on 3D object classification, 3D semantic and part segmentation, showing the benefits of PointDisc for data-efficient learning. Detailed analysis demonstrate that PointDisc learns unsupervised features that well capture local and global geometry.

- **Summary**: A number of deep learning based algorithms have been proposed to recover high-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones. Among them, some restore the missing details of each frame via exploring the spatiotemporal information of neighboring frames. However, these methods usually suffer from a narrow temporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the neighboring ones. In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we propose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within a long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference frames and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal compensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay more effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a moving object. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing ones on the MFQE 2.0 dataset in terms of both fidelity and perceptual effect.

- **Summary**: Despite recent breakthroughs in deep learning methods for image lighting enhancement, they are inferior when applied to portraits because 3D facial information is ignored in their models. To address this, we present a novel deep learning framework for portrait lighting enhancement based on 3D facial guidance. Our framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, corrected lighting parameters are predicted by a network from the input bad lighting image, with the assistance of a 3D morphable model and a differentiable renderer. Given the predicted lighting parameter, the differentiable renderer renders a face image with corrected shading and texture, which serves as the 3D guidance for learning image lighting enhancement in the second stage. To better exploit the long-range correlations between the input and the guidance, in the second stage, we design an image-to-image translation network with a novel transformer architecture, which automatically produces a lighting-enhanced result. Experimental results on the FFHQ dataset and in-the-wild images show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality. We will publish our dataset along with more results on https://cassiepython.github.io/egsr/index.html.

- **Summary**: We explore the value of weak labels in learning transferable representations for medical images. Compared to hand-labeled datasets, weak or inexact labels can be acquired in large quantities at significantly lower cost and can provide useful training signals for data-hungry models such as deep neural networks. We consider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly supervised contrastive learning (SWCL) framework for representation learning using semi-weakly annotated images. Specifically, we train a semi-supervised model to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse image-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific features encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks. Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline, and recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks, possibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed. Our method surpasses all prior self-supervised methods and standard cross-entropy training, while closing the gaps with ImageNet pretraining.

- **Summary**: Video captioning is an essential technology to understand scenes and describe events in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs not only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality, but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual Trans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two Trans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames from the beginning.

- **Summary**: Due to the mass advancement in ubiquitous technologies nowadays, new pervasive methods have come into the practice to provide new innovative features and stimulate the research on new human-computer interactions. This paper presents a hand gesture recognition method that utilizes the smartphone's built-in speakers and microphones. The proposed system emits an ultrasonic sonar-based signal (inaudible sound) from the smartphone's stereo speakers, which is then received by the smartphone's microphone and processed via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Hand Gesture Recognition. Data augmentation techniques are proposed to improve the detection accuracy and three dual-channel input fusion methods are compared. The first method merges the dual-channel audio as a single input spectrogram image. The second method adopts early fusion by concatenating the dual-channel spectrograms. The third method adopts late fusion by having two convectional input branches processing each of the dual-channel spectrograms and then the outputs are merged by the last layers. Our experimental results demonstrate a promising detection accuracy for the six gestures presented in our publicly available dataset with an accuracy of 93.58\% as a baseline.

- **Summary**: Quantifying uncertainty in medical image segmentation applications is essential, as it is often connected to vital decision-making. Compelling attempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation architectures, e.g. to learn a density segmentation model conditioned on the input image. Typical work in this field restricts these learnt densities to be strictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by introducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be more complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove this hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the posterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our qualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the multi-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation datasets, respectively, show a clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in the quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive performance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more flexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that attempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit of this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and segmentation, and enable eager adoption of the technology in practice.

- **Summary**: Enhancing the visibility in extreme low-light environments is a challenging task. Under nearly lightless condition, existing image denoising methods could easily break down due to significantly low SNR. In this paper, we systematically study the noise statistics in the imaging pipeline of CMOS photosensors, and formulate a comprehensive noise model that can accurately characterize the real noise structures. Our novel model considers the noise sources caused by digital camera electronics which are largely overlooked by existing methods yet have significant influence on raw measurement in the dark. It provides a way to decouple the intricate noise structure into different statistical distributions with physical interpretations. Moreover, our noise model can be used to synthesize realistic training data for learning-based low-light denoising algorithms. In this regard, although promising results have been shown recently with deep convolutional neural networks, the success heavily depends on abundant noisy clean image pairs for training, which are tremendously difficult to obtain in practice. Generalizing their trained models to images from new devices is also problematic. Extensive experiments on multiple low-light denoising datasets -- including a newly collected one in this work covering various devices -- show that a deep neural network trained with our proposed noise formation model can reach surprisingly-high accuracy. The results are on par with or sometimes even outperform training with paired real data, opening a new door to real-world extreme low-light photography.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging datasets are inherently high dimensional with large variability and low sample sizes that limit the effectiveness of deep learning algorithms. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the ability to synthesize realist images have shown great potential as an alternative to standard data augmentation techniques. Our work focuses on cross-modality synthesis of fluorodeoxyglucose~(FDG) Positron Emission Tomography~(PET) scans from structural Magnetic Resonance~(MR) images using generative models to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we propose a novel end-to-end, globally and locally aware image-to-image translation GAN (GLA-GAN) with a multi-path architecture that enforces both global structural integrity and fidelity to local details. We further supplement the standard adversarial loss with voxel-level intensity, multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and region-of-interest (ROI) based loss components that reduce reconstruction error, enforce structural consistency at different scales and perceive variation in regional sensitivity to AD respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our GLA-GAN not only generates synthesized FDG-PET scans with enhanced image quality but also superior clinical utility in improving AD diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art models. Finally, we attempt to interpret some of the internal units of the GAN that are closely related to this specific cross-modality generation task.



### Localized Shape Modelling with Global Coherence: An Inverse Spectral Approach

- **Summary**: Many natural shapes have most of their characterizing features concentrated over a few regions in space. For example, humans and animals have distinctive head shapes, while inorganic objects like chairs and airplanes are made of well-localized functional parts with specific geometric features. Often, these features are strongly correlated -- a modification of facial traits in a quadruped should induce changes to the body structure. However, in shape modelling applications, these types of edits are among the hardest ones; they require high precision, but also a global awareness of the entire shape. Even in the deep learning era, obtaining manipulable representations that satisfy such requirements is an open problem posing significant constraints. In this work, we address this problem by defining a data-driven model upon a family of linear operators (variants of the mesh Laplacian), whose spectra capture global and local geometric properties of the shape at hand. Modifications to these spectra are translated to semantically valid deformations of the corresponding surface. By explicitly decoupling the global from the local surface features, our pipeline allows to perform local edits while simultaneously maintaining a global stylistic coherence. We empirically demonstrate how our learning-based model generalizes to shape representations not seen at training time, and we systematically analyze different choices of local operators over diverse shape categories.



### Ordered Attention for Coherent Visual Storytelling

- **Summary**: We address the problem of visual storytelling, i.e., generating a story for a given sequence of images. While each sentence of the story should describe a corresponding image, a coherent story also needs to be consistent and relate to both future and past images. To achieve this we develop ordered image attention (OIA). OIA models interactions between the sentence-corresponding image and important regions in other images of the sequence. To highlight the important objects, a message-passing-like algorithm collects representations of those objects in an order-aware manner. To generate the story's sentences, we then highlight important image attention vectors with an Image-Sentence Attention (ISA). Further, to alleviate common linguistic mistakes like repetitiveness, we introduce an adaptive prior. The obtained results improve the METEOR score on the VIST dataset by 1%. In addition, an extensive human study verifies coherency improvements and shows that OIA and ISA generated stories are more focused, shareable, and image-grounded.

- **Summary**: The crux of self-supervised video representation learning is to build general features from unlabeled videos. However, most recent works have mainly focused on high-level semantics and neglected lower-level representations and their temporal relationship which are crucial for general video understanding. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level feature optimization framework to improve the generalization and temporal modeling ability of learned video representations. Concretely, high-level features obtained from naive and prototypical contrastive learning are utilized to build distribution graphs, guiding the process of low-level and mid-level feature learning. We also devise a simple temporal modeling module from multi-level features to enhance motion pattern learning. Experiments demonstrate that multi-level feature optimization with the graph constraint and temporal modeling can greatly improve the representation ability in video understanding.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based analysis of histopathology images shows promise in advancing the understanding of tumor progression, tumor micro-environment, and their underpinning biological processes. So far, these approaches have focused on extracting information associated with annotations. In this work, we ask how much information can be learned from the tissue architecture itself.   We present an adversarial learning model to extract feature representations of cancer tissue, without the need for manual annotations. We show that these representations are able to identify a variety of morphological characteristics across three cancer types: Breast, colon, and lung. This is supported by 1) the separation of morphologic characteristics in the latent space; 2) the ability to classify tissue type with logistic regression using latent representations, with an AUC of 0.97 and 85% accuracy, comparable to supervised deep models; 3) the ability to predict the presence of tumor in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using multiple instance learning (MIL), achieving an AUC of 0.98 and 94% accuracy.   Our results show that our model captures distinct phenotypic characteristics of real tissue samples, paving the way for further understanding of tumor progression and tumor micro-environment, and ultimately refining histopathological classification for diagnosis and treatment.

- **Summary**: The performance of machine learning algorithms, when used for segmenting 3D biomedical images, does not reach the level expected based on results achieved with 2D photos. This may be explained by the comparative lack of high-volume, high-quality training datasets, which require state-of-the-art imaging facilities, domain experts for annotation and large computational and personal resources. The HR-Kidney dataset presented in this work bridges this gap by providing 1.7 TB of artefact-corrected synchrotron radiation-based X-ray phase-contrast microtomography images of whole mouse kidneys and validated segmentations of 33 729 glomeruli, which corresponds to a one to two orders of magnitude increase over currently available biomedical datasets. The image sets also contain the underlying raw data, threshold- and morphology-based semi-automatic segmentations of renal vasculature and uriniferous tubules, as well as true 3D manual annotations. We therewith provide a broad basis for the scientific community to build upon and expand in the fields of image processing, data augmentation and machine learning, in particular unsupervised and semi-supervised learning investigations, as well as transfer learning and generative adversarial networks.

- **Summary**: Lung nodules are commonly missed in chest radiographs. We propose and evaluate P-AnoGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for lung nodules in radiographs. P-AnoGAN modifies the fast anomaly detection generative adversarial network (f-AnoGAN) by utilizing a progressive GAN and a convolutional encoder-decoder-encoder pipeline. Model training uses only unlabelled healthy lung patches extracted from the Indiana University Chest X-Ray Collection. External validation and testing are performed using healthy and unhealthy patches extracted from the ChestX-ray14 and Japanese Society for Radiological Technology datasets, respectively. Our model robustly identifies patches containing lung nodules in external validation and test data with ROC-AUC of 91.17% and 87.89%, respectively. These results show unsupervised methods may be useful in challenging tasks such as lung nodule detection in radiographs.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel hand-based person recognition method for the purpose of criminal investigations since the hand image is often the only available information in cases of serious crime such as sexual abuse. Our proposed method, Multi-Branch with Attention Network (MBA-Net), incorporates both channel and spatial attention modules in branches in addition to a global (without attention) branch to capture global structural information for discriminative feature learning. The attention modules focus on the relevant features of the hand image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. Extensive evaluations on two large multi-ethnic and publicly available hand datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the existing hand-based identification methods.

- **Summary**: Expensive bounding-box annotations have limited the development of object detection task. Thus, it is necessary to focus on more challenging task of few-shot object detection. It requires the detector to recognize objects of novel classes with only a few training samples. Nowadays, many existing popular methods adopting training way similar to meta-learning have achieved promising performance, such as Meta R-CNN series. However, support data is only used as the class attention to guide the detecting of query images each time. Their relevance to each other remains unexploited. Moreover, a lot of recent works treat the support data and query images as independent branch without considering the relationship between them. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic relevance learning model, which utilizes the relationship between all support images and Region of Interest (RoI) on the query images to construct a dynamic graph convolutional network (GCN). By adjusting the prediction distribution of the base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed model serves as a hard auxiliary classification task, which guides the detector to improve the class representation implicitly. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO dataset. The proposed model achieves the best overall performance, which shows its effectiveness of learning more generalized features.

- **Summary**: Image-based navigation is widely considered the next frontier of minimally invasive surgery. It is believed that image-based navigation will increase the access to reproducible, safe, and high-precision surgery as it may then be performed at acceptable costs and effort. This is because image-based techniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate with contemporary workflows. Further, it is expected that image-based navigation will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments and autonomous, robotic workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D registration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D structures, e.g., volumetric imagery or tool models, and 2D images thereof, such as fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a mature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been restrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness of the optimization objective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties around inconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One reason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely inadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of generic 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine learning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the desired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric models holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D registration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on 2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by introduction of this novel technology. Grounded in these insights, we then offer our perspective on the most pressing needs, significant open problems, and possible next steps.

- **Summary**: Due to the fact that fully supervised semantic segmentation methods require sufficient fully-labeled data to work well and can not generalize to unseen classes, few-shot segmentation has attracted lots of research attention. Previous arts extract features from support and query images, which are processed jointly before making predictions on query images. The whole process is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), leading to the problem that only local information is used. In this paper, we propose a TRansformer-based Few-shot Semantic segmentation method (TRFS). Specifically, our model consists of two modules: Global Enhancement Module (GEM) and Local Enhancement Module (LEM). GEM adopts transformer blocks to exploit global information, while LEM utilizes conventional convolutions to exploit local information, across query and support features. Both GEM and LEM are complementary, helping to learn better feature representations for segmenting query images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO datasets show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has demonstrated promise in developing objective prognostic models from histology whole slide images. However, most prognostic models are either based on histology or genomics alone and do not address how histology and genomics can be integrated to develop joint image-omic prognostic models. Additionally identifying explainable morphological and molecular descriptors from these models that govern such prognosis is of interest. We used multimodal deep learning to integrate gigapixel whole slide pathology images, RNA-seq abundance, copy number variation, and mutation data from 5,720 patients across 14 major cancer types. Our interpretable, weakly-supervised, multimodal deep learning algorithm is able to fuse these heterogeneous modalities for predicting outcomes and discover prognostic features from these modalities that corroborate with poor and favorable outcomes via multimodal interpretability. We compared our model with unimodal deep learning models trained on histology slides and molecular profiles alone, and demonstrate performance increase in risk stratification on 9 out of 14 cancers. In addition, we analyze morphologic and molecular markers responsible for prognostic predictions across all cancer types. All analyzed data, including morphological and molecular correlates of patient prognosis across the 14 cancer types at a disease and patient level are presented in an interactive open-access database (http://pancancer.mahmoodlab.org) to allow for further exploration and prognostic biomarker discovery. To validate that these model explanations are prognostic, we further analyzed high attention morphological regions in WSIs, which indicates that tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte presence corroborates with favorable cancer prognosis on 9 out of 14 cancer types studied.

- **Summary**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are frequently used for tasks involving time-sequential data such as speech recognition. Unlike previous LSTM accelerators that either exploit spatial weight sparsity or temporal activation sparsity, this paper proposes a new accelerator called "Spartus" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve ultra-low latency inference. Spatial sparsity is induced using a new Column-Balanced Targeted Dropout (CBTD) structured pruning method, producing structured sparse weight matrices for a balanced workload. The pruned networks running on Spartus hardware achieve weight sparsity levels of up to 96% and 94% with negligible accuracy loss on the TIMIT and the Librispeech datasets. To induce temporal sparsity in LSTM, we extend the previous DeltaGRU method to the DeltaLSTM method. Combining spatio-temporal sparsity with CBTD and DeltaLSTM saves on weight memory access and associated arithmetic operations. The Spartus architecture is scalable and supports real-time online speech recognition when implemented on small and large FPGAs. Spartus per-sample latency for a single DeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons averages 1 us. Exploiting spatio-temporal sparsity on our test LSTM network using the TIMIT dataset leads to 46X speedup of Spartus over its theoretical hardware performance to achieve 9.4 TOp/s effective batch-1 throughput and 1.1 TOp/s/W power efficiency.

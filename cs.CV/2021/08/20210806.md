- **Summary**: Transfer learning allows the reuse of deep learning features on new datasets with limited data. However, the resulting models could be unnecessarily large and thus inefficient. Although network pruning can be applied to improve inference efficiency, existing algorithms usually require fine-tuning and may not be suitable for small datasets. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that transforms the convolutional weights into the subspaces of orthonormal bases where a model is pruned. Using singular value decomposition, we decompose a convolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal basis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name "BasisScalingConv", which is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to the original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly independent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and stable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the numbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain unchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures. Basis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double pruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction in the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in parameters and 98.6% in FLOPs.

- **Summary**: Structured text understanding on Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) is a crucial part of Document Intelligence. Due to the complexity of content and layout in VRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing studies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels. This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer, we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and EPHOIE datasets.

- **Summary**: While image understanding on recognition-level has achieved remarkable advancements, reliable visual scene understanding requires comprehensive image understanding on recognition-level but also cognition-level, which calls for exploiting the multi-source information as well as learning different levels of understanding and extensive commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Cognitive Attention Network (CAN) for visual commonsense reasoning to achieve interpretable visual understanding. Specifically, we first introduce an image-text fusion module to fuse information from images and text collectively. Second, a novel inference module is designed to encode commonsense among image, query and response. Extensive experiments on large-scale Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/tanjatang/CAN

- **Summary**: Image Retrieval is a fundamental task of obtaining images similar to the query one from a database. A common image retrieval practice is to firstly retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by integrating local and global information inside images into compact image representations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global (DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last, the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final representation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be trained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art image retrieval performances on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

- **Summary**: Vietnam is such an attractive tourist destination with its stunning and pristine landscapes and its top-rated unique food and drink. Among thousands of Vietnamese dishes, foreigners and native people are interested in easy-to-eat tastes and easy-to-do recipes, along with reasonable prices, mouthwatering flavors, and popularity. Due to the diversity and almost all the dishes have significant similarities and the lack of quality Vietnamese food datasets, it is hard to implement an auto system to classify Vietnamese food, therefore, make people easier to discover Vietnamese food. This paper introduces a new Vietnamese food dataset named VinaFood21, which consists of 13,950 images corresponding to 21 dishes. We use 10,044 images for model training and 6,682 test images to classify each food in the VinaFood21 dataset and achieved an average accuracy of 74.81% when fine-tuning CNN EfficientNet-B0.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel framework to recover \emph{detailed} avatar from a single image. It is a challenging task due to factors such as variations in human shapes, body poses, texture, and viewpoints. Prior methods typically attempt to recover the human body shape using a parametric-based template that lacks the surface details. As such resulting body shape appears to be without clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based framework that combines the robustness of the parametric model with the flexibility of free-form 3D deformation. We use the deep neural networks to refine the 3D shape in a Hierarchical Mesh Deformation (HMD) framework, utilizing the constraints from body joints, silhouettes, and per-pixel shading information. Our method can restore detailed human body shapes with complete textures beyond skinned models. Experiments demonstrate that our method has outperformed previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving better accuracy in terms of both 2D IoU number and 3D metric distance.

- **Summary**: Single image dehazing is a challenging task, for which the domain shift between synthetic training data and real-world testing images usually leads to degradation of existing methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel image dehazing framework collaborating with unlabeled real data. First, we develop a disentangled image dehazing network (DID-Net), which disentangles the feature representations into three component maps, i.e. the latent haze-free image, the transmission map, and the global atmospheric light estimate, respecting the physical model of a haze process. Our DID-Net predicts the three component maps by progressively integrating features across scales, and refines each map by passing an independent refinement network. Then a disentangled-consistency mean-teacher network (DMT-Net) is employed to collaborate unlabeled real data for boosting single image dehazing. Specifically, we encourage the coarse predictions and refinements of each disentangled component to be consistent between the student and teacher networks by using a consistency loss on unlabeled real data. We make comparison with 13 state-of-the-art dehazing methods on a new collected dataset (Haze4K) and two widely-used dehazing datasets (i.e., SOTS and HazeRD), as well as on real-world hazy images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has obvious quantitative and qualitative improvements over the existing methods.

- **Summary**: Importance of structured-light based one-shot scanning technique is increasing because of its simple system configuration and ability of capturing moving objects. One severe limitation of the technique is that it can capture only sparse shape, but not high frequency shapes, because certain area of projection pattern is required to encode spatial information. In this paper, we propose a technique to recover high-frequency shapes by using shading information, which is captured by one-shot RGB-D sensor based on structured light with single camera. Since color image comprises shading information of object surface, high-frequency shapes can be recovered by shape from shading techniques. Although multiple images with different lighting positions are required for shape from shading techniques, we propose a learning based approach to recover shape from a single image. In addition, to overcome the problem of preparing sufficient amount of data for training, we propose a new data augmentation method for high-frequency shapes using synthetic data and domain adaptation. Experimental results are shown to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation. However, due to the stochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate images with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles.

- **Summary**: In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in detection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial attacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in vision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive evaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D object detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study. The findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Global forest cover is critical to the provision of certain ecosystem services. With the advent of the google earth engine cloud platform, fine resolution global land cover mapping task could be accomplished in a matter of days instead of years. The amount of global forest cover (GFC) products has been steadily increasing in the last decades. However, it's hard for users to select suitable one due to great differences between these products, and the accuracy of these GFC products has not been verified on global scale. To provide guidelines for users and producers, it is urgent to produce a validation sample set at the global level. However, this labeling task is time and labor consuming, which has been the main obstacle to the progress of global land cover mapping. In this research, a labor-efficient semi-automatic framework is introduced to build a biggest ever Forest Sample Set (FSS) contained 395280 scattered samples categorized as forest, shrubland, grassland, impervious surface, etc. On the other hand, to provide guidelines for the users, we comprehensively validated the local and global mapping accuracy of all existing 30m GFC products, and analyzed and mapped the agreement of them. Moreover, to provide guidelines for the producers, optimal sampling strategy was proposed to improve the global forest classification. Furthermore, a new global forest cover named GlobeForest2020 has been generated, which proved to improve the previous highest state-of-the-art accuracies (obtained by Gong et al., 2017) by 2.77% in uncertain grids and by 1.11% in certain grids.

- **Summary**: Background: Maintaining a healthy diet is vital to avoid health-related issues, e.g., undernutrition, obesity and many non-communicable diseases. An indispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual recording methods are not only burdensome but time-consuming, and contain substantial biases and errors. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially computer vision technologies, have made it possible to develop automatic dietary assessment solutions, which are more convenient, less time-consuming and even more accurate to monitor daily food intake. Scope and approach: This review presents Vision-Based Dietary Assessment (VBDA) architectures, including multi-stage architecture and end-to-end one. The multi-stage dietary assessment generally consists of three stages: food image analysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. The prosperity of deep learning makes VBDA gradually move to an end-to-end implementation, which applies food images to a single network to directly estimate the nutrition. The recently proposed end-to-end methods are also discussed. We further analyze existing dietary assessment datasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark is urgently needed, and finally highlight critical challenges and future trends for VBDA. Key findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find that multi-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of VBDA. Despite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA due to the meal complexity. We also provide the latest ideas for future development of VBDA, e.g., fine-grained food analysis and accurate volume estimation. This review aims to encourage researchers to propose more practical solutions for VBDA.

- **Summary**: Colonoscopy is a standard imaging tool for visualizing the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract of patients to capture lesion areas. However, it takes the clinicians excessive time to review a large number of images extracted from colonoscopy videos. Thus, automatic detection of biological anatomical landmarks within the colon is highly demanded, which can help reduce the burden of clinicians by providing guidance information for the locations of lesion areas. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach to detect biological anatomical landmarks in colonoscopy videos. First, raw colonoscopy video sequences are pre-processed to reject interference frames. Second, a ResNet-101 based network is used to detect three biological anatomical landmarks separately to obtain the intermediate detection results. Third, to achieve more reliable localization of the landmark periods within the whole video period, we propose to post-process the intermediate detection results by identifying the incorrectly predicted frames based on their temporal distribution and reassigning them back to the correct class. Finally, the average detection accuracy reaches 99.75\%. Meanwhile, the average IoU of 0.91 shows a high degree of similarity between our predicted landmark periods and ground truth. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is capable of accurately detecting and localizing biological anatomical landmarks from colonoscopy videos.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates a valuable setting called few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (FS-UDA), which has not been sufficiently studied in the literature. In this setting, the source domain data are labelled, but with few-shot per category, while the target domain data are unlabelled. To address the FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two key issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation between support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it will be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and target domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning (FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for image classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called similarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial relationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes the learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment. Specifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding (IMSE) method. It learns SPs to extract the local discriminative information for classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for domain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local feature matching are performed upon LDs. Extensive experiments conducted on a multi-domain benchmark dataset DomainNet demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of our IMSE for the novel setting of FS-UDA. In addition, for FSL, our IMSE can also show better performance than most of recent FSL methods on miniImageNet.

- **Summary**: Meshes are commonly used as 3D maps since they encode the topology of the scene while being lightweight.   Unfortunately, 3D meshes are mathematically difficult to handle directly because of their combinatorial and discrete nature.   Therefore, most approaches generate 3D meshes of a scene after fusing depth data using volumetric or other representations.   Nevertheless, volumetric fusion remains computationally expensive both in terms of speed and memory.   In this paper, we leapfrog these intermediate representations and build a 3D mesh directly from a depth map and the sparse landmarks triangulated with visual odometry.   To this end, we formulate a non-smooth convex optimization problem that we solve using a primal-dual method.   Our approach generates a smooth and accurate 3D mesh that substantially improves the state-of-the-art on direct mesh reconstruction while running in real-time.

- **Summary**: Currently, the state-of-the-art methods treat few-shot semantic segmentation task as a conditional foreground-background segmentation problem, assuming each class is independent. In this paper, we introduce the concept of meta-class, which is the meta information (e.g. certain middle-level features) shareable among all classes. To explicitly learn meta-class representations in few-shot segmentation task, we propose a novel Meta-class Memory based few-shot segmentation method (MM-Net), where we introduce a set of learnable memory embeddings to memorize the meta-class information during the base class training and transfer to novel classes during the inference stage. Moreover, for the $k$-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module to select images from the set of support images. A high-quality class prototype could be obtained with the weighted sum of support image features based on the quality measure. Experiments on both PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO dataset shows that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Particularly, our proposed MM-Net achieves 37.5\% mIoU on the COCO dataset in 1-shot setting, which is 5.1\% higher than the previous state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Visual retrieval system faces frequent model update and deployment. It is a heavy workload to re-extract features of the whole database every time.Feature compatibility enables the learned new visual features to be directly compared with the old features stored in the database. In this way, when updating the deployed model, we can bypass the inflexible and time-consuming feature re-extraction process. However, the old feature space that needs to be compatible is not ideal and faces the distribution discrepancy problem with the new space caused by different supervision losses. In this work, we propose a global optimization Dual-Tuning method to obtain feature compatibility against different networks and losses. A feature-level prototype loss is proposed to explicitly align two types of embedding features, by transferring global prototype information. Furthermore, we design a component-level mutual structural regularization to implicitly optimize the feature intrinsic structure. Experimental results on million-scale datasets demonstrate that our Dual-Tuning is able to obtain feature compatibility without sacrificing performance.

- **Summary**: Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual in crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for semi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited labeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all individuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the None-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals in each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd images may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to break the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to reduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First, instead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to annotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness from both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster centers of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich unlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd image to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation instead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods. In this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by individual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled regions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Due to domain shift, a large performance drop is usually observed when a trained crowd counting model is deployed in the wild. While existing domain-adaptive crowd counting methods achieve promising results, they typically regard each crowd image as a whole and reduce domain discrepancies in a holistic manner, thus limiting further improvement of domain adaptation performance. To this end, we propose to untangle \emph{domain-invariant} crowd and \emph{domain-specific} background from crowd images and design a fine-grained domain adaption method for crowd counting. Specifically, to disentangle crowd from background, we propose to learn crowd segmentation from point-level crowd counting annotations in a weakly-supervised manner. Based on the derived segmentation, we design a crowd-aware domain adaptation mechanism consisting of two crowd-aware adaptation modules, i.e., Crowd Region Transfer (CRT) and Crowd Density Alignment (CDA). The CRT module is designed to guide crowd features transfer across domains beyond background distractions. The CDA module dedicates to regularising target-domain crowd density generation by its own crowd density distribution. Our method outperforms previous approaches consistently in the widely-used adaptation scenarios.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning, which aims at minimizing the distance between positive pairs while maximizing that of negative ones, has been widely and successfully applied in unsupervised feature learning, where the design of positive and negative (pos/neg) pairs is one of its keys. In this paper, we attempt to devise a feature-level data manipulation, differing from data augmentation, to enhance the generic contrastive self-supervised learning. To this end, we first design a visualization scheme for pos/neg score (Pos/neg score indicates cosine similarity of pos/neg pair.) distribution, which enables us to analyze, interpret and understand the learning process. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of its kind. More importantly, leveraging this tool, we gain some significant observations, which inspire our novel Feature Transformation proposals including the extrapolation of positives. This operation creates harder positives to boost the learning because hard positives enable the model to be more view-invariant. Besides, we propose the interpolation among negatives, which provides diversified negatives and makes the model more discriminative. It is the first attempt to deal with both challenges simultaneously. Experiment results show that our proposed Feature Transformation can improve at least 6.0% accuracy on ImageNet-100 over MoCo baseline, and about 2.0% accuracy on ImageNet-1K over the MoCoV2 baseline. Transferring to the downstream tasks successfully demonstrate our model is less task-bias. Visualization tools and codes https://github.com/DTennant/CL-Visualizing-Feature-Transformation .

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of medical images is an essential first step in computer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many disparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is difficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural networks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image segmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the output of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need separate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not generalize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we suggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the intervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs inference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be used for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and 12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus, multiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We report a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other interactive segmentation techniques. Our method can be useful to clinicians for diagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the medical expert. The source-code and the detailed results are available here [1].

- **Summary**: The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries, and plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases, like aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment with open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug treatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the vessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and monitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of the aorta and its branching vessels if completed with a contrast agent, called CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree geometry from consecutive CTAs is overlaid and compared. This allows not only detection of changes in the aorta, but also of its branches, caused by the primary pathology or newly developed. When performed manually, this reconstruction requires slice by slice contouring, which could easily take a whole day for a single aortic vessel tree, and is therefore not feasible in clinical practice. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation algorithms, however, can complete this task in a fraction of the manual execution time and run in parallel to the clinical routine of the clinicians. In this paper, we systematically review computing techniques for the automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the aortic vessel tree. The review concludes with an in-depth discussion on how close these state-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical practice and how active this research field is, taking into account the number of publications, datasets and challenges.

- **Summary**: One of the key challenges in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is to efficiently rank the performances of architectures. The mainstream assessment of performance rankers uses ranking correlations (e.g., Kendall's tau), which pay equal attention to the whole space. However, the optimization goal of NAS is identifying top architectures while paying less attention on other architectures in the search space. In this paper, we show both empirically and theoretically that Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is a better metric for rankers. Subsequently, we propose a new algorithm, AceNAS, which directly optimizes NDCG with LambdaRank. It also leverages weak labels produced by weight-sharing NAS to pre-train the ranker, so as to further reduce search cost. Extensive experiments on 12 NAS benchmarks and a large-scale search space demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms SOTA NAS methods, with up to 3.67% accuracy improvement and 8x reduction on search cost.

- **Summary**: The low rank tensor completion (LRTC) problem has attracted great attention in computer vision and signal processing. How to acquire high quality image recovery effect is still an urgent task to be solved at present. This paper proposes a new tensor $L_{2,1}$ norm minimization model (TLNM) that integrates sum nuclear norm (SNN) method, differing from the classical tensor nuclear norm (TNN)-based tensor completion method, with $L_{2,1}$ norm and Qatar Riyal decomposition for solving the LRTC problem. To improve the utilization rate of the local prior information of the image, a total variation (TV) regularization term is introduced, resulting in a new class of tensor $L_{2,1}$ norm minimization with total variation model (TLNMTV). Both proposed models are convex and therefore have global optimal solutions. Moreover, we adopt the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) to obtain the closed-form solution of each variable, thus ensuring the feasibility of the algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the two proposed algorithms are convergent and outperform compared methods. In particular, our method significantly outperforms the contrastive methods when the sampling rate of hyperspectral images is 2.5\%.

- **Summary**: With autonomous driving developing in a booming stage, accurate object detection in complex scenarios attract wide attention to ensure the safety of autonomous driving. Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar and vision fusion is a mainstream solution for accurate obstacle detection. This article presents a detailed survey on mmWave radar and vision fusion based obstacle detection methods. First, we introduce the tasks, evaluation criteria, and datasets of object detection for autonomous driving. The process of mmWave radar and vision fusion is then divided into three parts: sensor deployment, sensor calibration, and sensor fusion, which are reviewed comprehensively. Specifically, we classify the fusion methods into data level, decision level, and feature level fusion methods. In addition, we introduce three-dimensional(3D) object detection, the fusion of lidar and vision in autonomous driving and multimodal information fusion, which are promising for the future. Finally, we summarize this article.

- **Summary**: In this article, a robust color-edge feature extraction method based on the Quaternion Hardy filter is proposed. The Quaternion Hardy filter is an emerging edge detection theory. It is along with the Poisson and conjugate Poisson smoothing kernels to handle various types of noise. Combining with the Quaternion Hardy filter, Jin's color gradient operator and Hough transform, the color-edge feature detection algorithm is proposed and applied to the lane marking detection. Experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm. The results are accurate and robust with respect to the complex environment lane markings.

In this work, a detailed description of an aluminium rig construction for creating a robust hand-washing dataset is discussed. The preliminary results with the help of image processing and computer vision algorithms for hand pose extraction and feature detection such as Harris detector, Shi-Tomasi and SIFT are demonstrated. The hand hygiene pose- Rub hands palm to palm was captured as an input image for running all the experiments. The future work will focus upon processing the video recordings of hand movements captured and applying deep-learning solutions for the classification of hand-hygiene stages.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models obtain impressive accuracy in road scenes understanding, however they need a large quantity of labeled samples for their training. Additionally, such models do not generalise well to environments where the statistical properties of data do not perfectly match those of training scenes, and this can be a significant problem for intelligent vehicles. Hence, domain adaptation approaches have been introduced to transfer knowledge acquired on a label-abundant source domain to a related label-scarce target domain. In this work, we design and carefully analyse multiple latent space-shaping regularisation strategies that work together to reduce the domain shift. More in detail, we devise a feature clustering strategy to increase domain alignment, a feature perpendicularity constraint to space apart features belonging to different semantic classes, including those not present in the current batch, and a feature norm alignment strategy to separate active and inactive channels. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation metric to capture the relative performance of an adapted model with respect to supervised training. We validate our framework in driving scenarios, considering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real adaptation, outperforming previous feature-level state-of-the-art methods on multiple road scenes benchmarks.

- **Summary**: A few-shot semantic segmentation model is typically composed of a CNN encoder, a CNN decoder and a simple classifier (separating foreground and background pixels). Most existing methods meta-learn all three model components for fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single support set image is available, effective model adaption of all three components to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose to simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest component, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to pre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation model over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the encoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any unseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For the classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer (CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights to each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show that despite its simplicity, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, often by a large margin.Code is available on https://github.com/zhiheLu/CWT-for-FSS.

- **Summary**: We propose a self-supervised contrastive learning approach for facial expression recognition (FER) in videos. We propose a novel temporal sampling-based augmentation scheme to be utilized in addition to standard spatial augmentations used for contrastive learning. Our proposed temporal augmentation scheme randomly picks from one of three temporal sampling techniques: (1) pure random sampling, (2) uniform sampling, and (3) sequential sampling. This is followed by a combination of up to three standard spatial augmentations. We then use a deep R(2+1)D network for FER, which we train in a self-supervised fashion based on the augmentations and subsequently fine-tune. Experiments are performed on the Oulu-CASIA dataset and the performance is compared to other works in FER. The results indicate that our method achieves an accuracy of 89.4%, setting a new state-of-the-art by outperforming other works. Additional experiments and analysis confirm the considerable contribution of the proposed temporal augmentation versus the existing spatial ones.

- **Summary**: Geometry-aware modules are widely applied in recent deep learning architectures for scene representation and rendering. However, these modules require intrinsic camera information that might not be obtained accurately. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Transformation Routing (STR) mechanism to model the spatial properties without applying any geometric prior. The STR mechanism treats the spatial transformation as the message passing process, and the relation between the view poses and the routing weights is modeled by an end-to-end trainable neural network. Besides, an Occupancy Concept Mapping (OCM) framework is proposed to provide explainable rationals for scene-fusion processes. We conducted experiments on several datasets and show that the proposed STR mechanism improves the performance of the Generative Query Network (GQN). The visualization results reveal that the routing process can pass the observed information from one location of some view to the associated location in the other view, which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed model in terms of spatial cognition.

- **Summary**: Rotating object detection has wide applications in aerial photographs, remote sensing images, UAVs, etc. At present, most of the rotating object detection datasets focus on the field of remote sensing, and these images are usually shot in high-altitude scenes. However, image datasets captured at low-altitude areas also should be concerned, such as drone-based datasets. So we present a low-altitude dronebased dataset, named UAV-ROD, aiming to promote the research and development in rotating object detection and UAV applications. The UAV-ROD consists of 1577 images and 30,090 instances of car category annotated by oriented bounding boxes. In particular, The UAV-ROD can be utilized for the rotating object detection, vehicle orientation recognition and object counting tasks. Compared with horizontal object detection, the regression stage of the rotation detection is a tricky problem. In this paper, we propose a rotating object detector TS4Net, which contains anchor refinement module (ARM) and two-stage sample selective strategy (TS4). The ARM can convert preseted horizontal anchors into high-quality rotated anchors through twostage anchor refinement. The TS4 module utilizes different constrained sample selective strategies to allocate positive and negative samples, which is adaptive to the regression task in different stages. Benefiting from the ARM and TS4, the TS4Net can achieve superior performance for rotating object detection solely with one preseted horizontal anchor. Extensive experimental results on UAV-ROD dataset and three remote sensing datasets DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against most state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, deep learning based methods have shown success in essential medical image analysis tasks such as segmentation. Post-processing and refining the results of segmentation is a common practice to decrease the misclassifications originating from the segmentation network. In addition to widely used methods like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) which focus on the structure of the segmented volume/area, a graph-based recent approach makes use of certain and uncertain points in a graph and refines the segmentation according to a small graph convolutional network (GCN). However, there are two drawbacks of the approach: most of the edges in the graph are assigned randomly and the GCN is trained independently from the segmentation network. To address these issues, we define a new neighbor-selection mechanism according to feature distances and combine the two networks in the training procedure. According to the experimental results on pancreas segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) images, we demonstrate improvement in the quantitative measures. Also, examining the dynamic neighbors created by our method, edges between semantically similar image parts are observed. The proposed method also shows qualitative enhancements in the segmentation maps, as demonstrated in the visual results.

- **Summary**: Analysis of cardiac ultrasound images is commonly performed in routine clinical practice for quantification of cardiac function. Its increasing automation frequently employs deep learning networks that are trained to predict disease or detect image features. However, such models are extremely data-hungry and training requires labelling of many thousands of images by experienced clinicians. Here we propose the use of contrastive learning to mitigate the labelling bottleneck. We train view classification models for imbalanced cardiac ultrasound datasets and show improved performance for views/classes for which minimal labelled data is available. Compared to a naive baseline model, we achieve an improvement in F1 score of up to 26% in those views while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for the views with sufficiently many labelled training observations.

- **Summary**: Lung ultrasound imaging has been shown effective in detecting typical patterns for interstitial pneumonia, as a point-of-care tool for both patients with COVID-19 and other community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this work, we focus on the hyperechoic B-line segmentation task. Using deep neural networks, we automatically outline the regions that are indicative of pathology-sensitive artifacts and their associated sonographic patterns. With a real-world data-scarce scenario, we investigate approaches to utilize both COVID-19 and CAP lung ultrasound data to train the networks; comparing fine-tuning and unsupervised domain adaptation. Segmenting either type of lung condition at inference may support a range of clinical applications during evolving epidemic stages, but also demonstrates value in resource-constrained clinical scenarios. Adapting real clinical data acquired from COVID-19 patients to those from CAP patients significantly improved Dice scores from 0.60 to 0.87 (p < 0.001) and from 0.43 to 0.71 (p < 0.001), on independent COVID-19 and CAP test cases, respectively. It is of practical value that the improvement was demonstrated with only a small amount of data in both training and adaptation data sets, a common constraint for deploying machine learning models in clinical practice. Interestingly, we also report that the inverse adaptation, from labelled CAP data to unlabeled COVID-19 data, did not demonstrate an improvement when tested on either condition. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation that correlates the segmentation performance to label consistency and data domain diversity in this point-of-care lung ultrasound application.

- **Summary**: Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive existing classification methods. It is extremely fast at training. Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face verification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals at the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The structure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for recognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For these reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine (SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams in parallel simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra Siamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group. Experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM, Extreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental results showed that the proposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy and 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the proposed feature provided 98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the well-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine methods by a wide margin.

- **Summary**: Detecting local features, such as corners, segments or blobs, is the first step in the pipeline of many Computer Vision applications. Its speed is crucial for real-time applications. In this paper we present ELSED, the fastest line segment detector in the literature. The key for its efficiency is a local segment growing algorithm that connects gradient-aligned pixels in presence of small discontinuities. The proposed algorithm not only runs in devices with very low end hardware, but may also be parametrized to foster the detection of short or longer segments, depending on the task at hand. We also introduce new metrics to evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of segment detectors. In our experiments with different public benchmarks we prove that our method accounts the highest repeatability and it is the most efficient in the literature. In the experiments we quantify the accuracy traded for such gain.

- **Summary**: Previous video object segmentation approaches mainly focus on using simplex solutions between appearance and motion, limiting feature collaboration efficiency among and across these two cues. In this work, we study a novel and efficient full-duplex strategy network (FSNet) to address this issue, by considering a better mutual restraint scheme between motion and appearance in exploiting the cross-modal features from the fusion and decoding stage. Specifically, we introduce the relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve bidirectional message propagation across embedding sub-spaces. To improve the model's robustness and update the inconsistent features from the spatial-temporal embeddings, we adopt the bidirectional purification module (BPM) after the RCAM. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks show that our FSNet is robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) and achieves favourable performance against existing cutting-edges both in the video object segmentation and video salient object detection tasks. The project is publicly available at: https://dpfan.net/FSNet.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains. However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source images in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical imaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from different clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for image segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a domain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived from anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from anatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall loss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the target images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our prior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios, with different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and cardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of the art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information, as the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our straightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular adversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting. Our framework can be readily used in a breadth of segmentation problems, and our code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA

- **Summary**: This paper reports on a dynamic semantic mapping framework that incorporates 3D scene flow measurements into a closed-form Bayesian inference model. Existence of dynamic objects in the environment can cause artifacts and traces in current mapping algorithms, leading to an inconsistent map posterior. We leverage state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and 3D flow estimation using deep learning to provide measurements for map inference. We develop a Bayesian model that propagates the scene with flow and infers a 3D continuous (i.e., can be queried at arbitrary resolution) semantic occupancy map outperforming its static counterpart. Extensive experiments using publicly available data sets show that the proposed framework improves over its predecessors and input measurements from deep neural networks consistently.

- **Summary**: We investigate the problem of training generative models on a very sparse collection of 3D models. We use geometrically motivated energies to augment and thus boost a sparse collection of example (training) models. We analyze the Hessian of the as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) energy to sample from and project to the underlying (local) shape space, and use the augmented dataset to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). We iterate the process of building latent spaces of VAE and augmenting the associated dataset, to progressively reveal a richer and more expressive generative space for creating geometrically and semantically valid samples. Our framework allows us to train generative 3D models even with a small set of good quality 3D models, which are typically hard to curate. We extensively evaluate our method against a set of strong baselines, provide ablation studies and demonstrate application towards establishing shape correspondences. We present multiple examples of interesting and meaningful shape variations even when starting from as few as 3-10 training shapes.

- **Summary**: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) maps have emerged as one of the most powerful representations for scene understanding due to their ability to provide rich spatial context while being easy to interpret and process. Such maps have found use in many real-world tasks that extensively rely on accurate scene segmentation as well as object instance identification in the BEV space for their operation. However, existing segmentation algorithms only predict the semantics in the BEV space, which limits their use in applications where the notion of object instances is also critical. In this work, we present the first BEV panoptic segmentation approach for directly predicting dense panoptic segmentation maps in the BEV, given a single monocular image in the frontal view (FV). Our architecture follows the top-down paradigm and incorporates a novel dense transformer module consisting of two distinct transformers that learn to independently map vertical and flat regions in the input image from the FV to the BEV. Additionally, we derive a mathematical formulation for the sensitivity of the FV-BEV transformation which allows us to intelligently weight pixels in the BEV space to account for the varying descriptiveness across the FV image. Extensive evaluations on the KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art in the PQ metric by 3.61 pp and 4.93 pp respectively.

- **Summary**: Turn-taking has played an essential role in structuring the regulation of a conversation. The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking his/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or reacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task. Although some prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some limitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may limit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly, the relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency of localization, separation, and conversation contexts is not effectively exploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the tracking and anticipatory decisions about the transition to a new speaker are usually ignored. Therefore, this work introduces a new Audio-Visual Transformer approach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in both audio and visual channels of a multi-speaker conversation video in the wild. The proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in both visual and audio signals. The temporal audio-visual relationships across spatial-temporal space are anticipated and optimized via the self-attention mechanism in a Transformerstructure. Moreover, a newly collected dataset is introduced for the main speaker detection. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first studies that is able to automatically localize and highlight the main speaker in both visual and audio channels in multi-speaker conversation videos.

- **Summary**: We tackle data-driven 3D point cloud registration. Given point correspondences, the standard Kabsch algorithm provides an optimal rotation estimate. This allows to train registration models in an end-to-end manner by differentiating the SVD operation. However, given the initial rotation estimate supplied by Kabsch, we show we can improve point correspondence learning during model training by extending the original optimization problem. In particular, we linearize the governing constraints of the rotation matrix and solve the resulting linear system of equations. We then iteratively produce new solutions by updating the initial estimate. Our experiments show that, by plugging our differentiable layer to existing learning-based registration methods, we improve the correspondence matching quality. This yields up to a 7% decrease in rotation error for correspondence-based data-driven registration methods.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation aims to predict pixel-level labels. It has become a popular task in various computer vision applications. While fully supervised segmentation methods have achieved high accuracy on large-scale vision datasets, they are unable to generalize on a new test environment or a new domain well. In this work, we first introduce a new Un-aligned Domain Score to measure the efficiency of a learned model on a new target domain in unsupervised manner. Then, we present the new Bijective Maximum Likelihood(BiMaL) loss that is a generalized form of the Adversarial Entropy Minimization without any assumption about pixel independence. We have evaluated the proposed BiMaL on two domains. The proposed BiMaL approach consistently outperforms the SOTA methods on empirical experiments on "SYNTHIA to Cityscapes", "GTA5 to Cityscapes", and "SYNTHIA to Vistas".

- **Summary**: Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation environments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use of simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics simulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0, an open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more diverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson 2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness level, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of tasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that map the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally, given a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy it. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks with minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to be more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful locations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to immerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can collect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them for imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to enable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the potential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson 2.0 and its new dataset are publicly available at http://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is one of the factors that cause the increase of mortality of women. The most widely used method for diagnosing this geological disease i.e. breast cancer is the ultrasound scan. Several key features such as the smoothness and the texture of the tumor captured through ultrasound scans encode the abnormality of the breast tumors (malignant from benign). However, ultrasound scans are often noisy and include irrelevant parts of the breast that may bias the segmentation of eventual tumors. In this paper, we are going to extract the region of interest ( i.e, bounding boxes of the tumors) and feed-forward them to one semantic segmentation encoder-decoder structure based on its classification (i.e, malignant or benign). the whole process aims to build an instance-based segmenter from a semantic segmenter and an object detector.

- **Summary**: The development of high quality medical image segmentation algorithms depends on the availability of large datasets with pixel-level labels. The challenges of collecting such datasets, especially in case of 3D volumes, motivate to develop approaches that can learn from other types of labels that are cheap to obtain, e.g. bounding boxes. We focus on 3D medical images with their corresponding 3D bounding boxes which are considered as series of per-slice non-tight 2D bounding boxes. While current weakly-supervised approaches that use 2D bounding boxes as weak labels can be applied to medical image segmentation, we show that their success is limited in cases when the assumption about the tightness of the bounding boxes breaks. We propose a new bounding box correction framework which is trained on a small set of pixel-level annotations to improve the tightness of a larger set of non-tight bounding box annotations. The effectiveness of our solution is demonstrated by evaluating a known weakly-supervised segmentation approach with and without the proposed bounding box correction algorithm. When the tightness is improved by our solution, the results of the weakly-supervised segmentation become much closer to those of the fully-supervised one.

- **Summary**: This paper strives for action recognition and detection in video modalities like RGB, depth maps or 3D-skeleton sequences when only limited modality-specific labeled examples are available. For the RGB, and derived optical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made available. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing or detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled examples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for other modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is to recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by learning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step training process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an RGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we then fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target modality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision strategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the target modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to the student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets and two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher provides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and 3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a different task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we show a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples to learn from are scarce

- **Summary**: We introduce BEHAVIOR, a benchmark for embodied AI with 100 activities in simulation, spanning a range of everyday household chores such as cleaning, maintenance, and food preparation. These activities are designed to be realistic, diverse, and complex, aiming to reproduce the challenges that agents must face in the real world. Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental difficulties for each activity: definition (it can differ by time, place, or person), instantiation in a simulator, and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these with three innovations. First, we propose an object-centric, predicate logic-based description language for expressing an activity's initial and goal conditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity. Second, we identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying environment to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate its realization in one such simulator. Third, we introduce a set of metrics to measure task progress and efficiency, absolute and relative to human demonstrators. We include 500 human demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) to serve as the human ground truth. Our experiments demonstrate that even state of the art embodied AI solutions struggle with the level of realism, diversity, and complexity imposed by the activities in our benchmark. We make BEHAVIOR publicly available at behavior.stanford.edu to facilitate and calibrate the development of new embodied AI solutions.

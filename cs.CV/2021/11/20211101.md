- **Summary**: To promote better performance-bandwidth trade-off for multi-agent perception, we propose a novel distilled collaboration graph (DiscoGraph) to model trainable, pose-aware, and adaptive collaboration among agents. Our key novelties lie in two aspects. First, we propose a teacher-student framework to train DiscoGraph via knowledge distillation. The teacher model employs an early collaboration with holistic-view inputs; the student model is based on intermediate collaboration with single-view inputs. Our framework trains DiscoGraph by constraining post-collaboration feature maps in the student model to match the correspondences in the teacher model. Second, we propose a matrix-valued edge weight in DiscoGraph. In such a matrix, each element reflects the inter-agent attention at a specific spatial region, allowing an agent to adaptively highlight the informative regions. During inference, we only need to use the student model named as the distilled collaboration network (DiscoNet). Attributed to the teacher-student framework, multiple agents with the shared DiscoNet could collaboratively approach the performance of a hypothetical teacher model with a holistic view. Our approach is validated on V2X-Sim 1.0, a large-scale multi-agent perception dataset that we synthesized using CARLA and SUMO co-simulation. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments in multi-agent 3D object detection show that DiscoNet could not only achieve a better performance-bandwidth trade-off than the state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods, but also bring more straightforward design rationale.

- **Summary**: This work investigates the use of robust optimal transport (OT) for shape matching. Specifically, we show that recent OT solvers improve both optimization-based and deep learning methods for point cloud registration, boosting accuracy at an affordable computational cost. This manuscript starts with a practical overview of modern OT theory. We then provide solutions to the main difficulties in using this framework for shape matching. Finally, we showcase the performance of transport-enhanced registration models on a wide range of challenging tasks: rigid registration for partial shapes; scene flow estimation on the Kitti dataset; and nonparametric registration of lung vascular trees between inspiration and expiration. Our OT-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on Kitti and for the challenging lung registration task, both in terms of accuracy and scalability. We also release PVT1010, a new public dataset of 1,010 pairs of lung vascular trees with densely sampled points. This dataset provides a challenging use case for point cloud registration algorithms with highly complex shapes and deformations. Our work demonstrates that robust OT enables fast pre-alignment and fine-tuning for a wide range of registration models, thereby providing a new key method for the computer vision toolbox.

- **Summary**: Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a useful aid in numerous clinical applications for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep neural networks have shown same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system be transparent, robust, fair and ensure accountability. Current deep neural solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the specifics concerning the decision making process. Therefore, there is a need to ensure interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be incorporated in the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine different types of interpretability methods that have been used for understanding deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based on the type of generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, we report the progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by various interpretability methods. Finally we discuss limitations, provide guidelines for using interpretability methods and future directions concerning the interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.

- **Summary**: Correspondence-based point cloud registration is a cornerstone in robotics perception and computer vision, which seeks to estimate the best rigid transformation aligning two point clouds from the putative correspondences. However, due to the limited robustness of 3D keypoint matching approaches, outliers, probably in large numbers, are prone to exist among the correspondences, which makes robust registration methods imperative. Unfortunately, existing robust methods have their own limitations (e.g. high computational cost or limited robustness) when facing high or extreme outlier ratios, probably unsuitable for practical use. In this paper, we present a novel, fast, deterministic and guaranteed robust solver, named TriVoC (Triple-layered Voting with Consensus maximization), for the robust registration problem. We decompose the selecting of the minimal 3-point sets into 3 consecutive layers, and in each layer we design an efficient voting and correspondence sorting framework on the basis of the pairwise equal-length constraint. In this manner, the 3-point sets can be selected independently from the reduced correspondence sets according to the sorted sequence, which can significantly lower the computational cost and meanwhile provide a strong guarantee to achieve the largest consensus set (as the final inlier set) as long as a probabilistic termination condition is fulfilled. Varied experiments show that our solver TriVoC is robust against up to 99% outliers, highly accurate, time-efficient even with extreme outlier ratios, and also practical for real-world applications, showing performance superior to other state-of-the-art competitors.

- **Summary**: Localization of anatomical landmarks is essential for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and research. In this paper, we propose a novel deep network, named feature aggregation and refinement network (FARNet), for the automatic detection of anatomical landmarks. To alleviate the problem of limited training data in the medical domain, our network adopts a deep network pre-trained on natural images as the backbone network and several popular networks have been compared. Our FARNet also includes a multi-scale feature aggregation module for multi-scale feature fusion and a feature refinement module for high-resolution heatmap regression. Coarse-to-fine supervisions are applied to the two modules to facilitate the end-to-end training. We further propose a novel loss function named Exponential Weighted Center loss for accurate heatmap regression, which focuses on the losses from the pixels near landmarks and suppresses the ones from far away. Our network has been evaluated on three publicly available anatomical landmark detection datasets, including cephalometric radiographs, hand radiographs, and spine radiographs, and achieves state-of-art performances on all three datasets.

- **Summary**: Face detection is a long-standing challenge in the field of computer vision, with the ultimate goal being to accurately localize human faces in an unconstrained environment. There are significant technical hurdles in making these systems accurate due to confounding factors related to pose, image resolution, illumination, occlusion, and viewpoint [44]. That being said, with recent developments in machine learning, face-detection systems have achieved extraordinary accuracy, largely built on data-driven deep-learning models [70]. Though encouraging, a critical aspect that limits face-detection performance and social responsibility of deployed systems is the inherent diversity of human appearance. Every human appearance reflects something unique about a person, including their heritage, identity, experiences, and visible manifestations of self-expression. However, there are questions about how well face-detection systems perform when faced with varying face size and shape, skin color, body modification, and body ornamentation. Towards this goal, we collected the Distinctive Human Appearance dataset, an image set that represents appearances with low frequency and that tend to be undersampled in face datasets. Then, we evaluated current state-of-the-art face-detection models in their ability to detect faces in these images. The evaluation results show that face-detection algorithms do not generalize well to these diverse appearances. Evaluating and characterizing the state of current face-detection models will accelerate research and development towards creating fairer and more accurate face-detection systems.

- **Summary**: As a deep learning model typically contains millions of trainable weights, there has been a growing demand for a more efficient network structure with reduced storage space and improved run-time efficiency. Pruning is one of the most popular network compression techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel unstructured pruning pipeline, Attention-based Simultaneous sparse structure and Weight Learning (ASWL). Unlike traditional channel-wise or weight-wise attention mechanism, ASWL proposed an efficient algorithm to calculate the pruning ratio through layer-wise attention for each layer, and both weights for the dense network and the sparse network are tracked so that the pruned structure is simultaneously learned from randomly initialized weights. Our experiments on MNIST, Cifar10, and ImageNet show that ASWL achieves superior pruning results in terms of accuracy, pruning ratio and operating efficiency when compared with state-of-the-art network pruning methods.



### Self-Verification in Image Denoising

- **Summary**: We devise a new regularization, called self-verification, for image denoising. This regularization is formulated using a deep image prior learned by the network, rather than a traditional predefined prior. Specifically, we treat the output of the network as a ``prior'' that we denoise again after ``re-noising''. The comparison between the again denoised image and its prior can be interpreted as a self-verification of the network's denoising ability. We demonstrate that self-verification encourages the network to capture low-level image statistics needed to restore the image. Based on this self-verification regularization, we further show that the network can learn to denoise even if it has not seen any clean images. This learning strategy is self-supervised, and we refer to it as Self-Verification Image Denoising (SVID). SVID can be seen as a mixture of learning-based methods and traditional model-based denoising methods, in which regularization is adaptively formulated using the output of the network. We show the application of SVID to various denoising tasks using only observed corrupted data. It can achieve the denoising performance close to supervised CNNs.



### Distilling Object Detectors with Feature Richness

- **Summary**: In recent years, large-scale deep models have achieved great success, but the huge computational complexity and massive storage requirements make it a great challenge to deploy them in resource-limited devices. As a model compression and acceleration method, knowledge distillation effectively improves the performance of small models by transferring the dark knowledge from the teacher detector. However, most of the existing distillation-based detection methods mainly imitating features near bounding boxes, which suffer from two limitations. First, they ignore the beneficial features outside the bounding boxes. Second, these methods imitate some features which are mistakenly regarded as the background by the teacher detector. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Feature-Richness Score (FRS) method to choose important features that improve generalized detectability during distilling. The proposed method effectively retrieves the important features outside the bounding boxes and removes the detrimental features within the bounding boxes. Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve excellent performance on both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. For example, RetinaNet with ResNet-50 achieves 39.7% in mAP on the COCO2017 dataset, which even surpasses the ResNet-101 based teacher detector 38.9% by 0.8%. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/duzhixing/FRS.



### RMNet: Equivalently Removing Residual Connection from Networks

- **Comment**: Equivalently removing residual connection from ResBlock with
  non-linear layer inside it, towards an efficient plain model
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Although residual connection enables training very deep neural networks, it is not friendly for online inference due to its multi-branch topology. This encourages many researchers to work on designing DNNs without residual connections at inference. For example, RepVGG re-parameterizes multi-branch topology to a VGG-like (single-branch) model when deploying, showing great performance when the network is relatively shallow. However, RepVGG can not transform ResNet to VGG equivalently because re-parameterizing methods can only be applied to linear blocks and the non-linear layers (ReLU) have to be put outside of the residual connection which results in limited representation ability, especially for deeper networks. In this paper, we aim to remedy this problem and propose to remove the residual connection in a vanilla ResNet equivalently by a reserving and merging (RM) operation on ResBlock. Specifically, the RM operation allows input feature maps to pass through the block while reserving their information and merges all the information at the end of each block, which can remove residual connections without changing the original output. As a plug-in method, RM Operation basically has three advantages: 1) its implementation makes it naturally friendly for high ratio network pruning. 2) it helps break the depth limitation of RepVGG. 3) it leads to better accuracy-speed trade-off network (RMNet) compared to ResNet and RepVGG. We believe the ideology of RM Operation can inspire many insights on model design for the community in the future. Code is available at: https://github.com/fxmeng/RMNet.



### Influential Prototypical Networks for Few Shot Learning: A Dermatological Case Study

- **Summary**: Prototypical network (PN) is a simple yet effective few shot learning strategy. It is a metric-based meta-learning technique where classification is performed by computing Euclidean distances to prototypical representations of each class. Conventional PN attributes equal importance to all samples and generates prototypes by simply averaging the support sample embeddings belonging to each class. In this work, we propose a novel version of PN that attributes weights to support samples corresponding to their influence on the support sample distribution. Influence weights of samples are calculated based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between the mean embeddings of sample distributions including and excluding the sample. Comprehensive evaluation of our proposed influential PN (IPNet) is performed by comparing its performance with other baseline PNs on three different benchmark dermatological datasets. IPNet outperforms all baseline models with compelling results across all three datasets and various N-way, K-shot classification tasks. Findings from cross-domain adaptation experiments further establish the robustness and generalizability of IPNet.

- **Summary**: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a key algorithm for classification of whole slide images (WSI). Histology WSIs can have billions of pixels, which create enormous computational and annotation challenges. Typically, such images are divided into a set of patches (a bag of instances), where only bag-level class labels are provided. Deep learning based MIL methods calculate instance features using convolutional neural network (CNN). Our proposed approach is also deep learning based, with the following two contributions: Firstly, we propose to explicitly account for dependencies between instances during training by embedding self-attention Transformer blocks to capture dependencies between instances. For example, a tumor grade may depend on the presence of several particular patterns at different locations in WSI, which requires to account for dependencies between patches. Secondly, we propose an instance-wise loss function based on instance pseudo-labels. We compare the proposed algorithm to multiple baseline methods, evaluate it on the PANDA challenge dataset, the largest publicly available WSI dataset with over 11K images, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.



### Learning Iterative Robust Transformation Synchronization

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Transformation Synchronization is the problem of recovering absolute transformations from a given set of pairwise relative motions. Despite its usefulness, the problem remains challenging due to the influences from noisy and outlier relative motions, and the difficulty to model analytically and suppress them with high fidelity. In this work, we avoid handcrafting robust loss functions, and propose to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn transformation synchronization. Unlike previous works which use complicated multi-stage pipelines, we use an iterative approach where each step consists of a single weight-shared message passing layer that refines the absolute poses from the previous iteration by predicting an incremental update in the tangent space. To reduce the influence of outliers, the messages are weighted before aggregation. Our iterative approach alleviates the need for an explicit initialization step and performs well with identity initial poses. Although our approach is simple, we show that it performs favorably against existing handcrafted and learned synchronization methods through experiments on both SO(3) and SE(3) synchronization.

- **Summary**: Accurate organ at risk (OAR) segmentation is critical to reduce the radiotherapy post-treatment complications. Consensus guidelines recommend a set of more than 40 OARs in the head and neck (H&N) region, however, due to the predictable prohibitive labor-cost of this task, most institutions choose a substantially simplified protocol by delineating a smaller subset of OARs and neglecting the dose distributions associated with other OARs. In this work we propose a novel, automated and highly effective stratified OAR segmentation (SOARS) system using deep learning to precisely delineate a comprehensive set of 42 H&N OARs. SOARS stratifies 42 OARs into anchor, mid-level, and small & hard subcategories, with specifically derived neural network architectures for each category by neural architecture search (NAS) principles. We built SOARS models using 176 training patients in an internal institution and independently evaluated on 1327 external patients across six different institutions. It consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by at least 3-5% in Dice score for each institutional evaluation (up to 36% relative error reduction in other metrics). More importantly, extensive multi-user studies evidently demonstrated that 98% of the SOARS predictions need only very minor or no revisions for direct clinical acceptance (saving 90% radiation oncologists workload), and their segmentation and dosimetric accuracy are within or smaller than the inter-user variation. These findings confirmed the strong clinical applicability of SOARS for the OAR delineation process in H&N cancer radiotherapy workflows, with improved efficiency, comprehensiveness, and quality.

- **Summary**: Another year of the multimodal brain tumor segmentation challenge (BraTS) 2021 provides an even larger dataset to facilitate collaboration and research of brain tumor segmentation methods, which are necessary for disease analysis and treatment planning. A large dataset size of BraTS 2021 and the advent of modern GPUs provide a better opportunity for deep-learning based approaches to learn tumor representation from the data. In this work, we maintained an encoder-decoder based segmentation network, but focused on a modification of network training process that minimizes redundancy under perturbations. Given a set trained networks, we further introduce a confidence based ensembling techniques to further improve the performance. We evaluated the method on BraTS 2021 validation board, and achieved 0.8600, 0.8868 and 0.9265 average dice for enhanced tumor core, tumor core and whole tumor, respectively. Our team (NVAUTO) submission was the top performing in terms of ET and TC scores and within top 10 performing teams in terms of WT scores.

- **Summary**: Recently, self-supervised learning has attracted great attention, since it only requires unlabeled data for model training. Contrastive learning is one popular method for self-supervised learning and has achieved promising empirical performance. However, the theoretical understanding of its generalization ability is still limited. To this end, we define a kind of $(\sigma,\delta)$-measure to mathematically quantify the data augmentation, and then provide an upper bound of the downstream classification error rate based on the measure. It reveals that the generalization ability of contrastive self-supervised learning is related to three key factors: alignment of positive samples, divergence of class centers, and concentration of augmented data. The first two factors are properties of learned representations, while the third one is determined by pre-defined data augmentation. We further investigate two canonical contrastive losses, InfoNCE and cross-correlation, to show how they provably achieve the first two factors. Moreover, we conduct experiments to study the third factor, and observe a strong correlation between downstream performance and the concentration of augmented data.

- **Summary**: Recent approaches based on metric learning have achieved great progress in few-shot learning. However, most of them are limited to image-level representation manners, which fail to properly deal with the intra-class variations and spatial knowledge and thus produce undesirable performance. In this paper we propose a Deep Bias Rectify Network (DBRN) to fully exploit the spatial information that exists in the structure of the feature representations. We first employ a bias rectify module to alleviate the adverse impact caused by the intra-class variations. bias rectify module is able to focus on the features that are more discriminative for classification by given different weights. To make full use of the training data, we design a prototype augment mechanism that can make the prototypes generated from the support set to be more representative. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on various popular few-shot classification benchmarks and our methods can outperform state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, recommender systems and search engines play an integral role in fashion e-commerce. Still, many challenges lie ahead, and this study tries to tackle some. This article first suggests a content-based fashion recommender system that uses a parallel neural network to take a single fashion item shop image as input and make in-shop recommendations by listing similar items available in the store. Next, the same structure is enhanced to personalize the results based on user preferences. This work then introduces a background augmentation technique that makes the system more robust to out-of-domain queries, enabling it to make street-to-shop recommendations using only a training set of catalog shop images. Moreover, the last contribution of this paper is a new evaluation metric for recommendation tasks called objective-guided human score. This method is an entirely customizable framework that produces interpretable, comparable scores from subjective evaluations of human scorers.

- **Summary**: 3D interacting hand reconstruction is essential to facilitate human-machine interaction and human behaviors understanding. Previous works in this field either rely on auxiliary inputs such as depth images or they can only handle a single hand if monocular single RGB images are used. Single-hand methods tend to generate collided hand meshes, when applied to closely interacting hands, since they cannot model the interactions between two hands explicitly. In this paper, we make the first attempt to reconstruct 3D interacting hands from monocular single RGB images. Our method can generate 3D hand meshes with both precise 3D poses and minimal collisions. This is made possible via a two-stage framework. Specifically, the first stage adopts a convolutional neural network to generate coarse predictions that tolerate collisions but encourage pose-accurate hand meshes. The second stage progressively ameliorates the collisions through a series of factorized refinements while retaining the preciseness of 3D poses. We carefully investigate potential implementations for the factorized refinement, considering the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results on large-scale datasets such as InterHand2.6M demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Automatic nuclei segmentation and classification play a vital role in digital pathology. However, previous works are mostly built on data with limited diversity and small sizes, making the results questionable or misleading in actual downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to build a reliable and robust method capable of dealing with data from the 'the clinical wild'. Specifically, we study and design a new method to simultaneously detect, segment, and classify nuclei from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histopathology data, and evaluate our approach using the recent largest dataset: PanNuke. We address the detection and classification of each nuclei as a novel semantic keypoint estimation problem to determine the center point of each nuclei. Next, the corresponding class-agnostic masks for nuclei center points are obtained using dynamic instance segmentation. Meanwhile, we proposed a novel Joint Pyramid Fusion Module (JPFM) to model the cross-scale dependencies, thus enhancing the local feature for better nuclei detection and classification. By decoupling two simultaneous challenging tasks and taking advantage of JPFM, our method can benefit from class-aware detection and class-agnostic segmentation, thus leading to a significant performance boost. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach for nuclei segmentation and classification across 19 different tissue types, delivering new benchmark results.

- **Summary**: Aggregating information from features across different layers is an essential operation for dense prediction models. Despite its limited expressiveness, feature concatenation dominates the choice of aggregation operations. In this paper, we introduce Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA) to fuse different network layers with more expressive non-linear operations. AFA exploits both spatial and channel attention to compute weighted average of the layer activations. Inspired by neural volume rendering, we extend AFA with Scale-Space Rendering (SSR) to perform late fusion of multi-scale predictions. AFA is applicable to a wide range of existing network designs. Our experiments show consistent and significant improvements on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, including Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas, at negligible computational and parameter overhead. In particular, AFA improves the performance of the Deep Layer Aggregation (DLA) model by nearly 6% mIoU on Cityscapes. Our experimental analyses show that AFA learns to progressively refine segmentation maps and to improve boundary details, leading to new state-of-the-art results on boundary detection benchmarks on BSDS500 and NYUDv2.

- **Summary**: Pooling layers are essential building blocks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to reduce computational overhead and increase the receptive fields of proceeding convolutional operations. Their goal is to produce downsampled volumes that closely resemble the input volume while, ideally, also being computationally and memory efficient. Meeting both these requirements remains a challenge. To this end, we propose an adaptive and exponentially weighted pooling method: adaPool. Our method learns a regional-specific fusion of two sets of pooling kernels that are based on the exponent of the Dice-Sorensen coefficient and the exponential maximum, respectively. AdaPool improves the preservation of detail on a range of tasks including image and video classification and object detection. A key property of adaPool is its bidirectional nature. In contrast to common pooling methods, the learned weights can also be used to upsample activation maps. We term this method adaUnPool. We evaluate adaUnPool on image and video super-resolution and frame interpolation. For benchmarking, we introduce Inter4K, a novel high-quality, high frame-rate video dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that adaPool systematically achieves better results across tasks and backbones, while introducing a minor additional computational and memory overhead.

- **Summary**: In recent years, image recognition applications have developed rapidly. A large number of studies and techniques have emerged in different fields, such as face recognition, pedestrian and vehicle re-identification, landmark retrieval, and product recognition. In this paper, we propose a practical lightweight image recognition system, named PP-ShiTu, consisting of the following 3 modules, mainbody detection, feature extraction and vector search. We introduce popular strategies including metric learning, deep hash, knowledge distillation and model quantization to improve accuracy and inference speed. With strategies above, PP-ShiTu works well in different scenarios with a set of models trained on a mixed dataset. Experiments on different datasets and benchmarks show that the system is widely effective in different domains of image recognition. All the above mentioned models are open-sourced and the code is available in the GitHub repository PaddleClas on PaddlePaddle.

- **Summary**: We present new theoretical foundations for unsupervised Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning in spiking neural networks (SNNs). In contrast to empirical parameter search used in most previous works, we provide novel theoretical grounds for SNN and STDP parameter tuning which considerably reduces design time. Using our generic framework, we propose a class of global, action-based and convolutional SNN-STDP architectures for learning spatio-temporal features from event-based cameras. We assess our methods on the N-MNIST, the CIFAR10-DVS and the IBM DVS128 Gesture datasets, all acquired with a real-world event camera. Using our framework, we report significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to both conventional state-of-the-art event-based feature descriptors (+8.2% on CIFAR10-DVS), and compared to state-of-the-art STDP-based systems (+9.3% on N-MNIST, +7.74% on IBM DVS128 Gesture). Our work contributes to both ultra-low-power learning in neuromorphic edge devices, and towards a biologically-plausible, optimization-based theory of cortical vision.

- **Summary**: The minimal geodesic models based on the Eikonal equations are capable of finding suitable solutions in various image segmentation scenarios. Existing geodesic-based segmentation approaches usually exploit image features in conjunction with geometric regularization terms, such as Euclidean curve length or curvature-penalized length, for computing geodesic curves. In this paper, we take into account a more complicated problem: finding curvature-penalized geodesic paths with a convexity shape prior. We establish new geodesic models relying on the strategy of orientation-lifting, by which a planar curve can be mapped to an high-dimensional orientation-dependent space. The convexity shape prior serves as a constraint for the construction of local geodesic metrics encoding a particular curvature constraint. Then the geodesic distances and the corresponding closed geodesic paths in the orientation-lifted space can be efficiently computed through state-of-the-art Hamiltonian fast marching method. In addition, we apply the proposed geodesic models to the active contours, leading to efficient interactive image segmentation algorithms that preserve the advantages of convexity shape prior and curvature penalization.

- **Summary**: Tracking the behaviour of livestock enables early detection and thus prevention of contagious diseases in modern animal farms. Apart from economic gains, this would reduce the amount of antibiotics used in livestock farming which otherwise enters the human diet exasperating the epidemic of antibiotic resistance - a leading cause of death. We could use standard video cameras, available in most modern farms, to monitor livestock. However, most computer vision algorithms perform poorly on this task, primarily because, (i) animals bred in farms look identical, lacking any obvious spatial signature, (ii) none of the existing trackers are robust for long duration, and (iii) real-world conditions such as changing illumination, frequent occlusion, varying camera angles, and sizes of the animals make it hard for models to generalize. Given these challenges, we develop an end-to-end behaviour monitoring system for group-housed pigs to perform simultaneous instance level segmentation, tracking, action recognition and re-identification (STAR) tasks. We present starformer, the first end-to-end multiple-object livestock monitoring framework that learns instance-level embeddings for grouped pigs through the use of transformer architecture. For benchmarking, we present Pigtrace, a carefully curated dataset comprising video sequences with instance level bounding box, segmentation, tracking and activity classification of pigs in real indoor farming environment. Using simultaneous optimization on STAR tasks we show that starformer outperforms popular baseline models trained for individual tasks.

- **Summary**: Modelling various spatio-temporal dependencies is the key to recognising human actions in skeleton sequences. Most existing methods excessively relied on the design of traversal rules or graph topologies to draw the dependencies of the dynamic joints, which is inadequate to reflect the relationships of the distant yet important joints. Furthermore, due to the locally adopted operations, the important long-range temporal information is therefore not well explored in existing works. To address this issue, in this work we propose LSTA-Net: a novel Long short-term Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network, which can effectively capture the long/short-range dependencies in a spatio-temporal manner. We devise our model into a pure factorised architecture which can alternately perform spatial feature aggregation and temporal feature aggregation. To improve the feature aggregation effect, a channel-wise attention mechanism is also designed and employed. Extensive experiments were conducted on three public benchmark datasets, and the results suggest that our approach can capture both long-and-short range dependencies in the space and time domain, yielding higher results than other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of sub-cortical structures from MRI scans is of interest in many neurological diagnosis. Since this is a laborious task machine learning and specifically deep learning (DL) methods have become explored. The structural complexity of the brain demands a large, high quality segmentation dataset to develop good DL-based solutions for sub-cortical structure segmentation. Towards this, we are releasing a set of 114, 1.5 Tesla, T1 MRI scans with manual delineations for 14 sub-cortical structures. The scans in the dataset were acquired from healthy young (21-30 years) subjects ( 58 male and 56 female) and all the structures are manually delineated by experienced radiology experts. Segmentation experiments have been conducted with this dataset and results demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained with deep-learning methods. Our sub-cortical structure segmentation dataset, Indian Brain Segmentation Dataset (IBSD) is made openly available at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5656776}.

- **Summary**: In the medical field, landmark detection in MRI plays an important role in reducing medical technician efforts in tasks like scan planning, image registration, etc. First, 88 landmarks spread across the brain anatomy in the three respective views -- sagittal, coronal, and axial are manually annotated, later guidelines from the expert clinical technicians are taken sub-anatomy-wise, for better localization of the existing landmarks, in order to identify and locate the important atlas landmarks even in oblique scans. To overcome limited data availability, we implement realistic data augmentation to generate synthetic 3D volumetric data. We use a modified HighRes3DNet model for solving brain MRI volumetric landmark detection problem. In order to visually explain our trained model on unseen data, and discern a stronger model from a weaker model, we implement Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) which produces a coarse localization map highlighting the regions the model is focusing. Our experiments show that the proposed method shows favorable results, and the overall pipeline can be extended to a variable number of landmarks and other anatomies.

- **Summary**: When deploying person re-identification (ReID) model in safety-critical applications, it is pivotal to understanding the robustness of the model against a diverse array of image corruptions. However, current evaluations of person ReID only consider the performance on clean datasets and ignore images in various corrupted scenarios. In this work, we comprehensively establish six ReID benchmarks for learning corruption invariant representation. In the field of ReID, we are the first to conduct an exhaustive study on corruption invariant learning in single- and cross-modality datasets, including Market-1501, CUHK03, MSMT17, RegDB, SYSU-MM01. After reproducing and examining the robustness performance of 21 recent ReID methods, we have some observations: 1) transformer-based models are more robust towards corrupted images, compared with CNN-based models, 2) increasing the probability of random erasing (a commonly used augmentation method) hurts model corruption robustness, 3) cross-dataset generalization improves with corruption robustness increases. By analyzing the above observations, we propose a strong baseline on both single- and cross-modality ReID datasets which achieves improved robustness against diverse corruptions. Our codes are available on https://github.com/MinghuiChen43/CIL-ReID.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in image classification remains a big challenge. In existing UDA image dataset, classes are usually organized in a flattened way, where a plain classifier can be trained. Yet in some scenarios, the flat categories originate from some base classes. For example, buggies belong to the class bird. We define the classification task where classes have characteristics above and the flat classes and the base classes are organized hierarchically as hierarchical image classification. Intuitively, leveraging such hierarchical structure will benefit hierarchical image classification, e.g., two easily confusing classes may belong to entirely different base classes. In this paper, we improve the performance of classification by fusing features learned from a hierarchy of labels. Specifically, we train feature extractors supervised by hierarchical labels and with UDA technology, which will output multiple features for an input image. The features are subsequently concatenated to predict the finest-grained class. This study is conducted with a new dataset named Lego-15. Consisting of synthetic images and real images of the Lego bricks, the Lego-15 dataset contains 15 classes of bricks. Each class originates from a coarse-level label and a middle-level label. For example, class "85080" is associated with bricks (coarse) and bricks round (middle). In this dataset, we demonstrate that our method brings about consistent improvement over the baseline in UDA in hierarchical image classification. Extensive ablation and variant studies provide insights into the new dataset and the investigated algorithm.

- **Summary**: The better accuracy and efficiency trade-off has been a challenging problem in object detection. In this work, we are dedicated to studying key optimizations and neural network architecture choices for object detection to improve accuracy and efficiency. We investigate the applicability of the anchor-free strategy on lightweight object detection models. We enhance the backbone structure and design the lightweight structure of the neck, which improves the feature extraction ability of the network. We improve label assignment strategy and loss function to make training more stable and efficient. Through these optimizations, we create a new family of real-time object detectors, named PP-PicoDet, which achieves superior performance on object detection for mobile devices. Our models achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and latency compared to other popular models. PicoDet-S with only 0.99M parameters achieves 30.6% mAP, which is an absolute 4.8% improvement in mAP while reducing mobile CPU inference latency by 55% compared to YOLOX-Nano, and is an absolute 7.1% improvement in mAP compared to NanoDet. It reaches 123 FPS (150 FPS using Paddle Lite) on mobile ARM CPU when the input size is 320. PicoDet-L with only 3.3M parameters achieves 40.9% mAP, which is an absolute 3.7% improvement in mAP and 44% faster than YOLOv5s. As shown in Figure 1, our models far outperform the state-of-the-art results for lightweight object detection.

- **Summary**: An iris presentation attack detection (IPAD) is essential for securing personal identity is widely used iris recognition systems. However, the existing IPAD algorithms do not generalize well to unseen and cross-domain scenarios because of capture in unconstrained environments and high visual correlation amongst bonafide and attack samples. These similarities in intricate textural and morphological patterns of iris ocular images contribute further to performance degradation. To alleviate these shortcomings, this paper proposes DFCANet: Dense Feature Calibration and Attention Guided Network which calibrates the locally spread iris patterns with the globally located ones. Uplifting advantages from feature calibration convolution and residual learning, DFCANet generates domain-specific iris feature representations. Since some channels in the calibrated feature maps contain more prominent information, we capitalize discriminative feature learning across the channels through the channel attention mechanism. In order to intensify the challenge for our proposed model, we make DFCANet operate over nonsegmented and non-normalized ocular iris images. Extensive experimentation conducted over challenging cross-domain and intra-domain scenarios highlights consistent outperforming results. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DFCANet achieves significant gains in performance for the benchmark IIITD CLI, IIIT CSD and NDCLD13 databases respectively. Further, a novel incremental learning-based methodology has been introduced so as to overcome disentangled iris-data characteristics and data scarcity. This paper also pursues the challenging scenario that considers soft-lens under the attack category with evaluation performed under various cross-domain protocols. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning aims to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data for performance boosting. Existing works primarily focus on image classification. In this paper, we delve into semi-supervised learning for object detection, where labeled data are more labor-intensive to collect. Current methods are easily distracted by noisy regions generated by pseudo labels. To combat the noisy labeling, we propose noise-resistant semi-supervised learning by quantifying the region uncertainty. We first investigate the adverse effects brought by different forms of noise associated with pseudo labels. Then we propose to quantify the uncertainty of regions by identifying the noise-resistant properties of regions over different strengths. By importing the region uncertainty quantification and promoting multipeak probability distribution output, we introduce uncertainty into training and further achieve noise-resistant learning. Experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Unlike 2D object detection where all RoI features come from grid pixels, the RoI feature extraction of 3D point cloud object detection is more diverse. In this paper, we first compare and analyze the differences in structure and performance between the two state-of-the-art models PV-RCNN and Voxel-RCNN. Then, we find that the performance gap between the two models does not come from point information, but structural information. The voxel features contain more structural information because they do quantization instead of downsampling to point cloud so that they can contain basically the complete information of the whole point cloud. The stronger structural information in voxel features makes the detector have higher performance in our experiments even if the voxel features don't have accurate location information. Then, we propose that structural information is the key to 3D object detection. Based on the above conclusion, we propose a Self-Attention RoI Feature Extractor (SARFE) to enhance structural information of the feature extracted from 3D proposals. SARFE is a plug-and-play module that can be easily used on existing 3D detectors. Our SARFE is evaluated on both KITTI dataset and Waymo Open dataset. With the newly introduced SARFE, we improve the performance of the state-of-the-art 3D detectors by a large margin in cyclist on KITTI dataset while keeping real-time capability.

- **Summary**: Strongly supervised learning requires detailed knowledge of truth labels at instance levels, and in many machine learning applications this is a major drawback. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular weakly supervised learning method where truth labels are not available at instance level, but only at bag-of-instances level. However, sometimes the nature of the problem requires a more complex description, where a nested architecture of bag-of-bags at different levels can capture underlying relationships, like similar instances grouped together. Predicting the latent labels of instances or inner-bags might be as important as predicting the final bag-of-bags label but is lost in a straightforward nested setting. We propose a Nested Multiple Instance with Attention (NMIA) model architecture combining the concept of nesting with attention mechanisms. We show that NMIA performs as conventional MIL in simple scenarios and can grasp a complex scenario providing insights to the latent labels at different levels.

- **Summary**: Estimating a 3D human pose has proven to be a challenging task, primarily because of the complexity of the human body joints, occlusions, and variability in lighting conditions. In this paper, we introduce a higher-order graph convolutional framework with initial residual connections for 2D-to-3D pose estimation. Using multi-hop neighborhoods for node feature aggregation, our model is able to capture the long-range dependencies between body joints. Moreover, our approach leverages residual connections, which are integrated by design in our network architecture, ensuring that the learned feature representations retain important information from the initial features of the input layer as the network depth increases. Experiments and ablations studies conducted on two standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving superior performance over strong baseline methods for 3D human pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models are being increasingly adopted in wide array of scientific domains, especially to handle high-dimensionality and volume of the scientific data. However, these models tend to be brittle due to their complexity and overparametrization, especially to the inadvertent adversarial perturbations that can appear due to common image processing such as compression or blurring that are often seen with real scientific data. It is crucial to understand this brittleness and develop models robust to these adversarial perturbations. To this end, we study the effect of observational noise from the exposure time, as well as the worst case scenario of a one-pixel attack as a proxy for compression or telescope errors on performance of ResNet18 trained to distinguish between galaxies of different morphologies in LSST mock data. We also explore how domain adaptation techniques can help improve model robustness in case of this type of naturally occurring attacks and help scientists build more trustworthy and stable models.

- **Summary**: Many LiDAR-based methods for detecting large objects, single-class object detection, or under easy situations were claimed to perform quite well. However, their performances of detecting small objects or under hard situations did not surpass those of the fusion-based ones due to failure to leverage the image semantics. In order to elevate the detection performance in a complicated environment, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-embedded fusion-based multi-class 3D object detection network which admits both LiDAR and camera sensor data streams, named Voxel-Pixel Fusion Network (VPFNet). Inside this network, a key novel component is called Voxel-Pixel Fusion (VPF) layer, which takes advantage of the geometric relation of a voxel-pixel pair and fuses the voxel features and the pixel features with proper mechanisms. Moreover, several parameters are particularly designed to guide and enhance the fusion effect after considering the characteristics of a voxel-pixel pair. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI benchmark for multi-class 3D object detection task under multilevel difficulty, and is shown to outperform all state-of-the-art methods in mean average precision (mAP). It is also noteworthy that our approach here ranks the first on the KITTI leaderboard for the challenging pedestrian class.



### Generative Occupancy Fields for 3D Surface-Aware Image Synthesis

  a 3D-aware generative model which could synthesize realistic images with 3D
  consistency and simultaneously learn compact object surfaces
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: The advent of generative radiance fields has significantly promoted the development of 3D-aware image synthesis. The cumulative rendering process in radiance fields makes training these generative models much easier since gradients are distributed over the entire volume, but leads to diffused object surfaces. In the meantime, compared to radiance fields occupancy representations could inherently ensure deterministic surfaces. However, if we directly apply occupancy representations to generative models, during training they will only receive sparse gradients located on object surfaces and eventually suffer from the convergence problem. In this paper, we propose Generative Occupancy Fields (GOF), a novel model based on generative radiance fields that can learn compact object surfaces without impeding its training convergence. The key insight of GOF is a dedicated transition from the cumulative rendering in radiance fields to rendering with only the surface points as the learned surface gets more and more accurate. In this way, GOF combines the merits of two representations in a unified framework. In practice, the training-time transition of start from radiance fields and march to occupancy representations is achieved in GOF by gradually shrinking the sampling region in its rendering process from the entire volume to a minimal neighboring region around the surface. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that GOF can synthesize high-quality images with 3D consistency and simultaneously learn compact and smooth object surfaces.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models for organ contouring in radiotherapy are poised for clinical usage, but currently, there exist few tools for automated quality assessment (QA) of the predicted contours. Using Bayesian models and their associated uncertainty, one can potentially automate the process of detecting inaccurate predictions. We investigate two Bayesian models for auto-contouring, DropOut and FlipOut, using a quantitative measure - expected calibration error (ECE) and a qualitative measure - region-based accuracy-vs-uncertainty (R-AvU) graphs. It is well understood that a model should have low ECE to be considered trustworthy. However, in a QA context, a model should also have high uncertainty in inaccurate regions and low uncertainty in accurate regions. Such behaviour could direct visual attention of expert users to potentially inaccurate regions, leading to a speed up in the QA process. Using R-AvU graphs, we qualitatively compare the behaviour of different models in accurate and inaccurate regions. Experiments are conducted on the MICCAI2015 Head and Neck Segmentation Challenge and on the DeepMindTCIA CT dataset using three models: DropOut-DICE, Dropout-CE (Cross Entropy) and FlipOut-CE. Quantitative results show that DropOut-DICE has the highest ECE, while Dropout-CE and FlipOut-CE have the lowest ECE. To better understand the difference between DropOut-CE and FlipOut-CE, we use the R-AvU graph which shows that FlipOut-CE has better uncertainty coverage in inaccurate regions than DropOut-CE. Such a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics explores a new approach that helps to select which model can be deployed as a QA tool in clinical settings.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of forecasting the trajectory of an egocentric camera wearer (ego-person) in crowded spaces. The trajectory forecasting ability learned from the data of different camera wearers walking around in the real world can be transferred to assist visually impaired people in navigation, as well as to instill human navigation behaviours in mobile robots, enabling better human-robot interactions. To this end, a novel egocentric human trajectory forecasting dataset was constructed, containing real trajectories of people navigating in crowded spaces wearing a camera, as well as extracted rich contextual data. We extract and utilize three different modalities to forecast the trajectory of the camera wearer, i.e., his/her past trajectory, the past trajectories of nearby people, and the environment such as the scene semantics or the depth of the scene. A Transformer-based encoder-decoder neural network model, integrated with a novel cascaded cross-attention mechanism that fuses multiple modalities, has been designed to predict the future trajectory of the camera wearer. Extensive experiments have been conducted, with results showing that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in egocentric human trajectory forecasting.

- **Summary**: Through this paper, we seek to reduce the communication barrier between the hearing-impaired community and the larger society who are usually not familiar with sign language in the sub-Saharan region of Africa with the largest occurrences of hearing disability cases, while using Nigeria as a case study. The dataset is a pioneer dataset for the Nigerian Sign Language and was created in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. We pre-processed the data in readiness for two different object detection models and a classification model and employed diverse evaluation metrics to gauge model performance on sign-language to text conversion tasks. Finally, we convert the predicted sign texts to speech and deploy the best performing model in a lightweight application that works in real-time and achieves impressive results converting sign words/phrases to text and subsequently, into speech.



### Improving Contrastive Learning on Imbalanced Seed Data via Open-World Sampling

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning approaches have achieved great success in learning visual representations with few labels of the target classes. That implies a tantalizing possibility of scaling them up beyond a curated "seed" benchmark, to incorporating more unlabeled images from the internet-scale external sources to enhance its performance. However, in practice, larger amount of unlabeled data will require more computing resources due to the bigger model size and longer training needed. Moreover, open-world unlabeled data usually follows an implicit long-tail class or attribute distribution, many of which also do not belong to the target classes. Blindly leveraging all unlabeled data hence can lead to the data imbalance as well as distraction issues. This motivates us to seek a principled approach to strategically select unlabeled data from an external source, in order to learn generalizable, balanced and diverse representations for relevant classes. In this work, we present an open-world unlabeled data sampling framework called Model-Aware K-center (MAK), which follows three simple principles: (1) tailness, which encourages sampling of examples from tail classes, by sorting the empirical contrastive loss expectation (ECLE) of samples over random data augmentations; (2) proximity, which rejects the out-of-distribution outliers that may distract training; and (3) diversity, which ensures diversity in the set of sampled examples. Empirically, using ImageNet-100-LT (without labels) as the seed dataset and two "noisy" external data sources, we demonstrate that MAK can consistently improve both the overall representation quality and the class balancedness of the learned features, as evaluated via linear classifier evaluation on full-shot and few-shot settings.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) produce high-quality images but are challenging to train. They need careful regularization, vast amounts of compute, and expensive hyper-parameter sweeps. We make significant headway on these issues by projecting generated and real samples into a fixed, pretrained feature space. Motivated by the finding that the discriminator cannot fully exploit features from deeper layers of the pretrained model, we propose a more effective strategy that mixes features across channels and resolutions. Our Projected GAN improves image quality, sample efficiency, and convergence speed. It is further compatible with resolutions of up to one Megapixel and advances the state-of-the-art Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) on twenty-two benchmark datasets. Importantly, Projected GANs match the previously lowest FIDs up to 40 times faster, cutting the wall-clock time from 5 days to less than 3 hours given the same computational resources.

- **Summary**: In egocentric videos, actions occur in quick succession. We capitalise on the action's temporal context and propose a method that learns to attend to surrounding actions in order to improve recognition performance. To incorporate the temporal context, we propose a transformer-based multimodal model that ingests video and audio as input modalities, with an explicit language model providing action sequence context to enhance the predictions. We test our approach on EPIC-KITCHENS and EGTEA datasets reporting state-of-the-art performance. Our ablations showcase the advantage of utilising temporal context as well as incorporating audio input modality and language model to rescore predictions.

- **Summary**: Question answering (QA) models are well-known to exploit data bias, e.g., the language prior in visual QA and the position bias in reading comprehension. Recent debiasing methods achieve good out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability with a considerable sacrifice of the in-distribution (ID) performance. Therefore, they are only applicable in domains where the test distribution is known in advance. In this paper, we present a novel debiasing method called Introspective Distillation (IntroD) to make the best of both worlds for QA. Our key technical contribution is to blend the inductive bias of OOD and ID by introspecting whether a training sample fits in the factual ID world or the counterfactual OOD one. Experiments on visual QA datasets VQA v2, VQA-CP, and reading comprehension dataset SQuAD demonstrate that our proposed IntroD maintains the competitive OOD performance compared to other debiasing methods, while sacrificing little or even achieving better ID performance compared to the non-debiasing ones.

- **Summary**: In this extended abstract, we will present and discuss opportunities and challenges brought about by a new deep learning method by AUC maximization (aka \underline{\bf D}eep \underline{\bf A}UC \underline{\bf M}aximization or {\bf DAM}) for medical image classification. Since AUC (aka area under ROC curve) is a standard performance measure for medical image classification, hence directly optimizing AUC could achieve a better performance for learning a deep neural network than minimizing a traditional loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss). Recently, there emerges a trend of using deep AUC maximization for large-scale medical image classification. In this paper, we will discuss these recent results by highlighting (i) the advancements brought by stochastic non-convex optimization algorithms for DAM; (ii) the promising results on various medical image classification problems. Then, we will discuss challenges and opportunities of DAM for medical image classification from three perspectives, feature learning, large-scale optimization, and learning trustworthy AI models.

- **Summary**: Upsampling videos of human activity is an interesting yet challenging task with many potential applications ranging from gaming to entertainment and sports broadcasting. The main difficulty in synthesizing video frames in this setting stems from the highly complex and non-linear nature of human motion and the complex appearance and texture of the body. We propose to address these issues in a motion-guided frame-upsampling framework that is capable of producing realistic human motion and appearance. A novel motion model is trained to inference the non-linear skeletal motion between frames by leveraging a large-scale motion-capture dataset (AMASS). The high-frame-rate pose predictions are then used by a neural rendering pipeline to produce the full-frame output, taking the pose and background consistency into consideration. Our pipeline only requires low-frame-rate videos and unpaired human motion data but does not require high-frame-rate videos for training. Furthermore, we contribute the first evaluation dataset that consists of high-quality and high-frame-rate videos of human activities for this task. Compared with state-of-the-art video interpolation techniques, our method produces in-between frames with better quality and accuracy, which is evident by state-of-the-art results on pixel-level, distributional metrics and comparative user evaluations. Our code and the collected dataset are available at https://git.io/Render-In-Between.

- **Summary**: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are implicit generative models which allow to sample from class-conditional distributions. Existing cGANs are based on a wide range of different discriminator designs and training objectives. One popular design in earlier works is to include a classifier during training with the assumption that good classifiers can help eliminate samples generated with wrong classes. Nevertheless, including classifiers in cGANs often comes with a side effect of only generating easy-to-classify samples. Recently, some representative cGANs avoid the shortcoming and reach state-of-the-art performance without having classifiers. Somehow it remains unanswered whether the classifiers can be resurrected to design better cGANs. In this work, we demonstrate that classifiers can be properly leveraged to improve cGANs. We start by using the decomposition of the joint probability distribution to connect the goals of cGANs and classification as a unified framework. The framework, along with a classic energy model to parameterize distributions, justifies the use of classifiers for cGANs in a principled manner. It explains several popular cGAN variants, such as ACGAN, ProjGAN, and ContraGAN, as special cases with different levels of approximations, which provides a unified view and brings new insights to understanding cGANs. Experimental results demonstrate that the design inspired by the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art cGANs on multiple benchmark datasets, especially on the most challenging ImageNet.

- **Summary**: In order to analyze a trained model performance and identify its weak spots, one has to set aside a portion of the data for testing. The test set has to be large enough to detect statistically significant biases with respect to all the relevant sub-groups in the target population. This requirement may be difficult to satisfy, especially in data-hungry applications. We propose to overcome this difficulty by generating synthetic test set. We use the face landmarks detection task to validate our proposal by showing that all the biases observed on real datasets are also seen on a carefully designed synthetic dataset. This shows that synthetic test sets can efficiently detect a model's weak spots and overcome limitations of real test set in terms of quantity and/or diversity.

- **Summary**: Vast requirement of computation power of Deep Neural Networks is a major hurdle to their real world applications. Many recent Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips feature dedicated hardware support for Neural Network Acceleration. However, as ASICs take multiple years to develop, they are inevitably out-paced by the latest development in Neural Architecture Research. For example, Transformer Networks do not have native support on many popular chips, and hence are difficult to deploy. In this paper, we propose Arch-Net, a family of Neural Networks made up of only operators efficiently supported across most architectures of ASICs. When a Arch-Net is produced, less common network constructs, like Layer Normalization and Embedding Layers, are eliminated in a progressive manner through label-free Blockwise Model Distillation, while performing sub-eight bit quantization at the same time to maximize performance. Empirical results on machine translation and image classification tasks confirm that we can transform latest developed Neural Architectures into fast running and as-accurate Arch-Net, ready for deployment on multiple mass-produced ASIC chips. The code will be available at https://github.com/megvii-research/Arch-Net.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have led to remarkable achievements in face image synthesis. While methods that use style-based GANs can generate strikingly photorealistic face images, it is often difficult to control the characteristics of the generated faces in a meaningful and disentangled way. Prior approaches aim to achieve such semantic control and disentanglement within the latent space of a previously trained GAN. In contrast, we propose a framework that a priori models physical attributes of the face such as 3D shape, albedo, pose, and lighting explicitly, thus providing disentanglement by design. Our method, MOST-GAN, integrates the expressive power and photorealism of style-based GANs with the physical disentanglement and flexibility of nonlinear 3D morphable models, which we couple with a state-of-the-art 2D hair manipulation network. MOST-GAN achieves photorealistic manipulation of portrait images with fully disentangled 3D control over their physical attributes, enabling extreme manipulation of lighting, facial expression, and pose variations up to full profile view.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in localized implicit functions have enabled neural implicit representation to be scalable to large scenes. However, the regular subdivision of 3D space employed by these approaches fails to take into account the sparsity of the surface occupancy and the varying granularities of geometric details. As a result, its memory footprint grows cubically with the input volume, leading to a prohibitive computational cost even at a moderately dense decomposition. In this work, we present a learnable hierarchical implicit representation for 3D surfaces, coded OctField, that allows high-precision encoding of intricate surfaces with low memory and computational budget. The key to our approach is an adaptive decomposition of 3D scenes that only distributes local implicit functions around the surface of interest. We achieve this goal by introducing a hierarchical octree structure to adaptively subdivide the 3D space according to the surface occupancy and the richness of part geometry. As octree is discrete and non-differentiable, we further propose a novel hierarchical network that models the subdivision of octree cells as a probabilistic process and recursively encodes and decodes both octree structure and surface geometry in a differentiable manner. We demonstrate the value of OctField for a range of shape modeling and reconstruction tasks, showing superiority over alternative approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a large-scale detailed 3D face dataset, FaceScape, and the corresponding benchmark to evaluate single-view facial 3D reconstruction. By training on FaceScape data, a novel algorithm is proposed to predict elaborate riggable 3D face models from a single image input. FaceScape dataset provides 18,760 textured 3D faces, captured from 938 subjects and each with 20 specific expressions. The 3D models contain the pore-level facial geometry that is also processed to be topologically uniformed. These fine 3D facial models can be represented as a 3D morphable model for rough shapes and displacement maps for detailed geometry. Taking advantage of the large-scale and high-accuracy dataset, a novel algorithm is further proposed to learn the expression-specific dynamic details using a deep neural network. The learned relationship serves as the foundation of our 3D face prediction system from a single image input. Different than the previous methods, our predicted 3D models are riggable with highly detailed geometry under different expressions. We also use FaceScape data to generate the in-the-wild and in-the-lab benchmark to evaluate recent methods of single-view face reconstruction. The accuracy is reported and analyzed on the dimensions of camera pose and focal length, which provides a faithful and comprehensive evaluation and reveals new challenges. The unprecedented dataset, benchmark, and code have been released to the public for research purpose.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks with multilevel connections process input data in complex ways to learn the information.A networks learning efficiency depends not only on the complex neural network architecture but also on the input training images.Medical image segmentation with deep neural networks for skull stripping or tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance images enables learning both global and local features of the images.Though medical images are collected in a controlled environment,there may be artifacts or equipment based variance that cause inherent bias in the input set.In this study, we investigated the correlation between the image quality metrics of MR images with the neural network segmentation accuracy.For that we have used the 3D DenseNet architecture and let the network trained on the same input but applying different methodologies to select the training data set based on the IQM values.The difference in the segmentation accuracy between models based on the random training inputs with IQM based training inputs shed light on the role of image quality metrics on segmentation accuracy.By running the image quality metrics to choose the training inputs,further we may tune the learning efficiency of the network and the segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: A digital video is a collection of individual frames, while streaming the video the scene utilized the time slice for each frame. High refresh rate and high frame rate is the demand of all high technology applications. The action tracking in videos becomes easier and motion becomes smoother in gaming applications due to the high refresh rate. It provides a faster response because of less time in between each frame that is displayed on the screen. FREGAN (Frame Rate Enhancement Generative Adversarial Network) model has been proposed, which predicts future frames of a video sequence based on a sequence of past frames. In this paper, we investigated the GAN model and proposed FREGAN for the enhancement of frame rate in videos. We have utilized Huber loss as a loss function in the proposed FREGAN. It provided excellent results in super-resolution and we have tried to reciprocate that performance in the application of frame rate enhancement. We have validated the effectiveness of the proposed model on the standard datasets (UCF101 and RFree500). The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed model has a Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34.94 and a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.95.

- **Summary**: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) generate realistic images by incorporating class information into GAN. While one of the most popular cGANs is an auxiliary classifier GAN with softmax cross-entropy loss (ACGAN), it is widely known that training ACGAN is challenging as the number of classes in the dataset increases. ACGAN also tends to generate easily classifiable samples with a lack of diversity. In this paper, we introduce two cures for ACGAN. First, we identify that gradient exploding in the classifier can cause an undesirable collapse in early training, and projecting input vectors onto a unit hypersphere can resolve the problem. Second, we propose the Data-to-Data Cross-Entropy loss (D2D-CE) to exploit relational information in the class-labeled dataset. On this foundation, we propose the Rebooted Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ReACGAN). The experimental results show that ReACGAN achieves state-of-the-art generation results on CIFAR10, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB200, and ImageNet datasets. We also verify that ReACGAN benefits from differentiable augmentations and that D2D-CE harmonizes with StyleGAN2 architecture. Model weights and a software package that provides implementations of representative cGANs and all experiments in our paper are available at https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN.

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning (CL) can learn generalizable feature representations and achieve the state-of-the-art performance of downstream tasks by finetuning a linear classifier on top of it. However, as adversarial robustness becomes vital in image classification, it remains unclear whether or not CL is able to preserve robustness to downstream tasks. The main challenge is that in the self-supervised pretraining + supervised finetuning paradigm, adversarial robustness is easily forgotten due to a learning task mismatch from pretraining to finetuning. We call such a challenge 'cross-task robustness transferability'. To address the above problem, in this paper we revisit and advance CL principles through the lens of robustness enhancement. We show that (1) the design of contrastive views matters: High-frequency components of images are beneficial to improving model robustness; (2) Augmenting CL with pseudo-supervision stimulus (e.g., resorting to feature clustering) helps preserve robustness without forgetting. Equipped with our new designs, we propose AdvCL, a novel adversarial contrastive pretraining framework. We show that AdvCL is able to enhance cross-task robustness transferability without loss of model accuracy and finetuning efficiency. With a thorough experimental study, we demonstrate that AdvCL outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised robust learning methods across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10) and finetuning schemes (linear evaluation and full model finetuning).

- **Summary**: In many applications, it is essential to understand why a machine learning model makes the decisions it does, but this is inhibited by the black-box nature of state-of-the-art neural networks. Because of this, increasing attention has been paid to explainability in deep learning, including in the area of video understanding. Due to the temporal dimension of video data, the main challenge of explaining a video action recognition model is to produce spatiotemporally consistent visual explanations, which has been ignored in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose Frequency-based Extremal Perturbation (F-EP) to explain a video understanding model's decisions. Because the explanations given by perturbation methods are noisy and non-smooth both spatially and temporally, we propose to modulate the frequencies of gradient maps from the neural network model with a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We show in a range of experiments that F-EP provides more spatiotemporally consistent explanations that more faithfully represent the model's decisions compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged with superior performance on computer vision tasks compared to convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models. However, ViTs are mainly designed for image classification that generate single-scale low-resolution representations, which makes dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation challenging for ViTs. Therefore, we propose HRViT, which enhances ViTs to learn semantically-rich and spatially-precise multi-scale representations by integrating high-resolution multi-branch architectures with ViTs. We balance the model performance and efficiency of HRViT by various branch-block co-optimization techniques. Specifically, we explore heterogeneous branch designs, reduce the redundancy in linear layers, and augment the attention block with enhanced expressiveness. Those approaches enabled HRViT to push the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency on semantic segmentation to a new level, as our evaluation results on ADE20K and Cityscapes show. HRViT achieves 50.20% mIoU on ADE20K and 83.16% mIoU on Cityscapes, surpassing state-of-the-art MiT and CSWin backbones with an average of +1.78 mIoU improvement, 28% parameter saving, and 21% FLOPs reduction, demonstrating the potential of HRViT as a strong vision backbone for semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Eye-in-hand camera calibration is a fundamental and long-studied problem in robotics. We present a study on using learning-based methods for solving this problem online from a single RGB image, whilst training our models with entirely synthetic data. We study three main approaches: one direct regression model that directly predicts the extrinsic matrix from an image, one sparse correspondence model that regresses 2D keypoints and then uses PnP, and one dense correspondence model that uses regressed depth and segmentation maps to enable ICP pose estimation. In our experiments, we benchmark these methods against each other and against well-established classical methods, to find the surprising result that direct regression outperforms other approaches, and we perform noise-sensitivity analysis to gain further insights into these results.

- **Summary**: Before the deep learning revolution, many perception algorithms were based on runtime optimization in conjunction with a strong prior/regularization penalty. A prime example of this in computer vision is optical and scene flow. Supervised learning has largely displaced the need for explicit regularization. Instead, they rely on large amounts of labeled data to capture prior statistics, which are not always readily available for many problems. Although optimization is employed to learn the neural network, the weights of this network are frozen at runtime. As a result, these learning solutions are domain-specific and do not generalize well to other statistically different scenarios. This paper revisits the scene flow problem that relies predominantly on runtime optimization and strong regularization. A central innovation here is the inclusion of a neural scene flow prior, which uses the architecture of neural networks as a new type of implicit regularizer. Unlike learning-based scene flow methods, optimization occurs at runtime, and our approach needs no offline datasets -- making it ideal for deployment in new environments such as autonomous driving. We show that an architecture based exclusively on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can be used as a scene flow prior. Our method attains competitive -- if not better -- results on scene flow benchmarks. Also, our neural prior's implicit and continuous scene flow representation allows us to estimate dense long-term correspondences across a sequence of point clouds. The dense motion information is represented by scene flow fields where points can be propagated through time by integrating motion vectors. We demonstrate such a capability by accumulating a sequence of lidar point clouds.

- **Summary**: We propose MONet, a convolutional neural network that jointly detects motion boundaries (MBs) and occlusion regions (Occs) in video both forward and backward in time. Detection is difficult because optical flow is discontinuous along MBs and undefined in Occs, while many flow estimators assume smoothness and a flow defined everywhere. To reason in the two time directions simultaneously, we direct-warp the estimated maps between the two frames. Since appearance mismatches between frames often signal vicinity to MBs or Occs, we construct a cost block that for each feature in one frame records the lowest discrepancy with matching features in a search range. This cost block is two-dimensional, and much less expensive than the four-dimensional cost volumes used in flow analysis. Cost-block features are computed by an encoder, and MB and Occ estimates are computed by a decoder. We found that arranging decoder layers fine-to-coarse, rather than coarse-to-fine, improves performance. MONet outperforms the prior state of the art for both tasks on the Sintel and FlyingChairsOcc benchmarks without any fine-tuning on them.

- **Summary**: Pre-training on large scale unlabelled datasets has shown impressive performance improvements in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. Given the advent of large-scale instructional video datasets, a common strategy for pre-training video encoders is to use the accompanying speech as weak supervision. However, as speech is used to supervise the pre-training, it is never seen by the video encoder, which does not learn to process that modality. We address this drawback of current pre-training methods, which fail to exploit the rich cues in spoken language. Our proposal is to pre-train a video encoder using all the available video modalities as supervision, namely, appearance, sound, and transcribed speech. We mask an entire modality in the input and predict it using the other two modalities. This encourages each modality to collaborate with the others, and our video encoder learns to process appearance and audio as well as speech. We show the superior performance of our "modality masking" pre-training approach for video retrieval on the How2R, YouCook2 and Condensed Movies datasets.

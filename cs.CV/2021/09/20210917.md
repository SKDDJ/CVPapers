- **Summary**: We propose a novel low-complexity lidar gesture recognition system for mobile robot control robust to gesture variation. Our system uses a modular approach, consisting of a pose estimation module and a gesture classifier. Pose estimates are predicted from lidar scans using a Convolutional Neural Network trained using an existing stereo-based pose estimation system. Gesture classification is accomplished using a Long Short-Term Memory network and uses a sequence of estimated body poses as input to predict a gesture. Breaking down the pipeline into two modules reduces the dimensionality of the input, which could be lidar scans, stereo imagery, or any other modality from which body keypoints can be extracted, making our system lightweight and suitable for mobile robot control with limited computing power. The use of lidar contributes to the robustness of the system, allowing it to operate in most outdoor conditions, to be independent of lighting conditions, and for input to be detected 360 degrees around the robot. The lidar-based pose estimator and gesture classifier use data augmentation and automated labeling techniques, requiring a minimal amount of data collection and avoiding the need for manual labeling. We report experimental results for each module of our system and demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it in a real-world robot teleoperation setting.

- **Summary**: Geo-tagged photo based tourist attraction recommendation can discover users' travel preferences from their taken photos, so as to recommend suitable tourist attractions to them. However, existing visual content based methods cannot fully exploit the user and tourist attraction information of photos to extract visual features, and do not differentiate the significances of different photos. In this paper, we propose multi-level visual similarity based personalized tourist attraction recommendation using geo-tagged photos (MEAL). MEAL utilizes the visual contents of photos and interaction behavior data to obtain the final embeddings of users and tourist attractions, which are then used to predict the visit probabilities. Specifically, by crossing the user and tourist attraction information of photos, we define four visual similarity levels and introduce a corresponding quintuplet loss to embed the visual contents of photos. In addition, to capture the significances of different photos, we exploit the self-attention mechanism to obtain the visual representations of users and tourist attractions. We conducted experiments on a dataset crawled from Flickr, and the experimental results proved the advantage of this method.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning provides great significance in left atrium (LA) segmentation model learning with insufficient labelled data. Generalising semi-supervised learning to cross-domain data is of high importance to further improve model robustness. However, the widely existing distribution difference and sample mismatch between different data domains hinder the generalisation of semi-supervised learning. In this study, we alleviate these problems by proposing an Adaptive Hierarchical Dual Consistency (AHDC) for the semi-supervised LA segmentation on cross-domain data. The AHDC mainly consists of a Bidirectional Adversarial Inference module (BAI) and a Hierarchical Dual Consistency learning module (HDC). The BAI overcomes the difference of distributions and the sample mismatch between two different domains. It mainly learns two mapping networks adversarially to obtain two matched domains through mutual adaptation. The HDC investigates a hierarchical dual learning paradigm for cross-domain semi-supervised segmentation based on the obtained matched domains. It mainly builds two dual-modelling networks for mining the complementary information in both intra-domain and inter-domain. For the intra-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the dual-modelling targets to exploit the complementary modelling information. For the inter-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the LAs modelled by two dual-modelling networks to exploit the complementary knowledge among different data domains. We demonstrated the performance of our proposed AHDC on four 3D late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MR (LGE-CMR) datasets from different centres and a 3D CT dataset. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed AHDC achieved higher segmentation accuracy, which indicated its capability in the cross-domain semi-supervised LA segmentation.

- **Summary**: Automated 3-D breast ultrasound (ABUS) is a newfound system for breast screening that has been proposed as a supplementary modality to mammography for breast cancer detection. While ABUS has better performance in dense breasts, reading ABUS images is exhausting and time-consuming. So, a computer-aided detection system is necessary for interpretation of these images. Mass segmentation plays a vital role in the computer-aided detection systems and it affects the overall performance. Mass segmentation is a challenging task because of the large variety in size, shape, and texture of masses. Moreover, an imbalanced dataset makes segmentation harder. A novel mass segmentation approach based on deep learning is introduced in this paper. The deep network that is used in this study for image segmentation is inspired by U-net, which has been used broadly for dense segmentation in recent years. The system's performance was determined using a dataset of 50 masses including 38 malign and 12 benign lesions. The proposed segmentation method attained a mean Dice of 0.82 which outperformed a two-stage supervised edge-based method with a mean Dice of 0.74 and an adaptive region growing method with a mean Dice of 0.65.

- **Summary**: Retrieval-based place recognition is an efficient and effective solution for re-localization within a pre-built map, or global data association for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The accuracy of such an approach is heavily dependent on the quality of the extracted scene-level representation. While end-to-end solutions - which learn a global descriptor from input point clouds - have demonstrated promising results, such approaches are limited in their ability to enforce desirable properties at the local feature level. In this paper, we introduce a local consistency loss to guide the network towards learning local features which are consistent across revisits, hence leading to more repeatable global descriptors resulting in an overall improvement in 3D place recognition performance. We formulate our approach in an end-to-end trainable architecture called LoGG3D-Net. Experiments on two large-scale public benchmarks (KITTI and MulRan) show that our method achieves mean $F1_{max}$ scores of $0.939$ and $0.968$ on KITTI and MulRan respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance while operating in near real-time.

- **Summary**: Exploiting relations among 2D joints plays a crucial role yet remains semi-developed in 2D-to-3D pose estimation. To alleviate this issue, we propose GraFormer, a novel transformer architecture combined with graph convolution for 3D pose estimation. The proposed GraFormer comprises two repeatedly stacked core modules, GraAttention and ChebGConv block. GraAttention enables all 2D joints to interact in global receptive field without weakening the graph structure information of joints, which introduces vital features for later modules. Unlike vanilla graph convolutions that only model the apparent relationship of joints, ChebGConv block enables 2D joints to interact in the high-order sphere, which formulates their hidden implicit relations. We empirically show the superiority of GraFormer through conducting extensive experiments across popular benchmarks. Specifically, GraFormer outperforms state of the art on Human3.6M dataset while using 18$\%$ parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/Graformer/GraFormer .

- **Summary**: The Dynamic Saliency Prediction (DSP) task simulates the human selective attention mechanism to perceive the dynamic scene, which is significant and imperative in many vision tasks. Most of existing methods only consider visual cues, while neglect the accompanied audio information, which can provide complementary information for the scene understanding. In fact, there exists a strong relation between auditory and visual cues, and humans generally perceive the surrounding scene by collaboratively sensing these cues. Motivated by this, an audio-visual collaborative representation learning method is proposed for the DSP task, which explores the audio modality to better predict the dynamic saliency map by assisting vision modality. The proposed method consists of three parts: 1) audio-visual encoding, 2) audio-visual location, and 3) collaborative integration parts. Firstly, a refined SoundNet architecture is adopted to encode audio modality for obtaining corresponding features, and a modified 3D ResNet-50 architecture is employed to learn visual features, containing both spatial location and temporal motion information. Secondly, an audio-visual location part is devised to locate the sound source in the visual scene by learning the correspondence between audio-visual information. Thirdly, a collaborative integration part is devised to adaptively aggregate audio-visual information and center-bias prior to generate the final saliency map. Extensive experiments are conducted on six challenging audiovisual eye-tracking datasets, including DIEM, AVAD, Coutrot1, Coutrot2, SumMe, and ETMD, which shows significant superiority over state-of-the-art DSP models.

- **Summary**: Generating portrait images by controlling the motions of existing faces is an important task of great consequence to social media industries. For easy use and intuitive control, semantically meaningful and fully disentangled parameters should be used as modifications. However, many existing techniques do not provide such fine-grained controls or use indirect editing methods i.e. mimic motions of other individuals. In this paper, a Portrait Image Neural Renderer (PIRenderer) is proposed to control the face motions with the parameters of three-dimensional morphable face models (3DMMs). The proposed model can generate photo-realistic portrait images with accurate movements according to intuitive modifications. Experiments on both direct and indirect editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of this model. Meanwhile, we further extend this model to tackle the audio-driven facial reenactment task by extracting sequential motions from audio inputs. We show that our model can generate coherent videos with convincing movements from only a single reference image and a driving audio stream.

- **Summary**: Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is "aligned" with the remaining views -- not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach.

- **Summary**: The recent success of Transformer has provided a new direction to various visual understanding tasks, including video-based facial expression recognition (FER). By modeling visual relations effectively, Transformer has shown its power for describing complicated patterns. However, Transformer still performs unsatisfactorily to notice subtle facial expression movements, because the expression movements of many videos can be too small to extract meaningful spatial-temporal relations and achieve robust performance. To this end, we propose to decompose each video into a series of expression snippets, each of which contains a small number of facial movements, and attempt to augment the Transformer's ability for modeling intra-snippet and inter-snippet visual relations, respectively, obtaining the Expression snippet Transformer (EST). In particular, for intra-snippet modeling, we devise an attention-augmented snippet feature extractor (AA-SFE) to enhance the encoding of subtle facial movements of each snippet by gradually attending to more salient information. In addition, for inter-snippet modeling, we introduce a shuffled snippet order prediction (SSOP) head and a corresponding loss to improve the modeling of subtle motion changes across subsequent snippets by training the Transformer to identify shuffled snippet orders. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets (i.e., BU-3DFE, MMI, AFEW, and DFEW) demonstrate that our EST is superior to other CNN-based methods, obtaining state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The conventional encoder-decoder framework for image captioning generally adopts a single-pass decoding process, which predicts the target descriptive sentence word by word in temporal order. Despite the great success of this framework, it still suffers from two serious disadvantages. Firstly, it is unable to correct the mistakes in the predicted words, which may mislead the subsequent prediction and result in error accumulation problem. Secondly, such a framework can only leverage the already generated words but not the possible future words, and thus lacks the ability of global planning on linguistic information. To overcome these limitations, we explore a universal two-pass decoding framework, where a single-pass decoding based model serving as the Drafting Model first generates a draft caption according to an input image, and a Deliberation Model then performs the polishing process to refine the draft caption to a better image description. Furthermore, inspired from the complementarity between different modalities, we propose a novel Cross Modification Attention (CMA) module to enhance the semantic expression of the image features and filter out error information from the draft captions. We integrate CMA with the decoder of our Deliberation Model and name it as Cross Modification Attention based Deliberation Model (CMA-DM). We train our proposed framework by jointly optimizing all trainable components from scratch with a trade-off coefficient. Experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our approach obtains significant improvements over single-pass decoding baselines and achieves competitive performances compared with other state-of-the-art two-pass decoding based methods.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation have drawn massive attention as it is important in biomedical image analysis. Good segmentation results can assist doctors with their judgement and further improve patients' experience. Among many available pipelines in medical image analysis, Unet is one of the most popular neural networks as it keeps raw features by adding concatenation between encoder and decoder, which makes it still widely used in industrial field. In the mean time, as a popular model which dominates natural language process tasks, transformer is now introduced to computer vision tasks and have seen promising results in object detection, image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Therefore, the combination of transformer and Unet is supposed to be more efficient than both methods working individually. In this article, we propose Transformer-Unet by adding transformer modules in raw images instead of feature maps in Unet and test our network in CT82 datasets for Pancreas segmentation accordingly. We form an end-to-end network and gain segmentation results better than many previous Unet based algorithms in our experiment. We demonstrate our network and show our experimental results in this paper accordingly.

- **Summary**: In the last few years, the scientific community showed a remarkable and increasing interest towards 3D Virtual Environments, training and testing Machine Learning-based models in realistic virtual worlds. On one hand, these environments could also become a mean to study the weaknesses of Machine Learning algorithms, or to simulate training settings that allow Machine Learning models to gain robustness to 3D adversarial attacks. On the other hand, their growing popularity might also attract those that aim at creating adversarial conditions to invalidate the benchmarking process, especially in the case of public environments that allow the contribution from a large community of people. Most of the existing Adversarial Machine Learning approaches are focused on static images, and little work has been done in studying how to deal with 3D environments and how a 3D object should be altered to fool a classifier that observes it. In this paper, we study how to craft adversarial 3D objects by altering their textures, using a tool chain composed of easily accessible elements. We show that it is possible, and indeed simple, to create adversarial objects using off-the-shelf limited surrogate renderers that can compute gradients with respect to the parameters of the rendering process, and, to a certain extent, to transfer the attacks to more advanced 3D engines. We propose a saliency-based attack that intersects the two classes of renderers in order to focus the alteration to those texture elements that are estimated to be effective in the target engine, evaluating its impact in popular neural classifiers.

- **Summary**: Lines provide the significantly richer geometric structural information about the environment than points, so lines are widely used in recent Visual Odometry (VO) works. Since VO with lines use line tracking results to locate and map, line tracking is a crucial component in VO. Although the state-of-the-art line tracking methods have made great progress, they are still heavily dependent on line detection or the predicted line segments. In order to relieve the dependencies described above to track line segments completely, accurately, and robustly at higher computational efficiency, we propose a structure-aware Line tracking algorithm based entirely on Optical Flow (LOF). Firstly, we propose a gradient-based strategy to sample pixels on lines that are suitable for line optical flow calculation. Then, in order to align the lines by fully using the structural relationship between the sampled points on it and effectively removing the influence of sampled points on it occluded by other objects, we propose a two-step structure-aware line segment alignment method. Furthermore, we propose a line refinement method to refine the orientation, position, and endpoints of the aligned line segments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LOF outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in line tracking accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, which also improves the location accuracy and robustness of VO system with lines.

- **Summary**: The canonical approach to video action recognition dictates a neural model to do a classic and standard 1-of-N majority vote task. They are trained to predict a fixed set of predefined categories, limiting their transferable ability on new datasets with unseen concepts. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on action recognition by attaching importance to the semantic information of label texts rather than simply mapping them into numbers. Specifically, we model this task as a video-text matching problem within a multimodal learning framework, which strengthens the video representation with more semantic language supervision and enables our model to do zero-shot action recognition without any further labeled data or parameters requirements. Moreover, to handle the deficiency of label texts and make use of tremendous web data, we propose a new paradigm based on this multimodal learning framework for action recognition, which we dub "pre-train, prompt and fine-tune". This paradigm first learns powerful representations from pre-training on a large amount of web image-text or video-text data. Then it makes the action recognition task to act more like pre-training problems via prompt engineering. Finally, it end-to-end fine-tunes on target datasets to obtain strong performance. We give an instantiation of the new paradigm, ActionCLIP, which not only has superior and flexible zero-shot/few-shot transfer ability but also reaches a top performance on general action recognition task, achieving 83.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with a ViT-B/16 as the backbone.

- **Summary**: We propose a lightweight CPU network based on the MKLDNN acceleration strategy, named PP-LCNet, which improves the performance of lightweight models on multiple tasks. This paper lists technologies which can improve network accuracy while the latency is almost constant. With these improvements, the accuracy of PP-LCNet can greatly surpass the previous network structure with the same inference time for classification. As shown in Figure 1, it outperforms the most state-of-the-art models. And for downstream tasks of computer vision, it also performs very well, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, etc. All our experiments are implemented based on PaddlePaddle. Code and pretrained models are available at PaddleClas.

- **Summary**: Visual dialog, which aims to hold a meaningful conversation with humans about a given image, is a challenging task that requires models to reason the complex dependencies among visual content, dialog history, and current questions. Graph neural networks are recently applied to model the implicit relations between objects in an image or dialog. However, they neglect the importance of 1) coreference relations among dialog history and dependency relations between words for the question representation; and 2) the representation of the image based on the fully represented question. Therefore, we propose a novel relation-aware graph-over-graph network (GoG) for visual dialog. Specifically, GoG consists of three sequential graphs: 1) H-Graph, which aims to capture coreference relations among dialog history; 2) History-aware Q-Graph, which aims to fully understand the question through capturing dependency relations between words based on coreference resolution on the dialog history; and 3) Question-aware I-Graph, which aims to capture the relations between objects in an image based on fully question representation. As an additional feature representation module, we add GoG to the existing visual dialogue model. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the strong baseline in both generative and discriminative settings by a significant margin.

- **Summary**: The segmentation of complex images into semantic regions has seen a growing interest these last years with the advent of Deep Learning. Until recently, most existing methods for Historical Document Analysis focused on the visual appearance of documents, ignoring the rich information that textual content can offer. However, the segmentation of complex documents into semantic regions is sometimes impossible relying only on visual features and recent models embed both visual and textual information. In this paper, we focus on the use of both visual and textual information for segmenting historical registers into structured and meaningful units such as acts. An act is a text recording containing valuable knowledge such as demographic information (baptism, marriage or death) or royal decisions (donation or pardon). We propose a simple pipeline to enrich document images with the position of text lines containing key-phrases and show that running a standard image-based layout analysis system on these images can lead to significant gains. Our experiments show that the detection of acts increases from 38 % of mAP to 74 % when adding textual information, in real use-case conditions where text lines positions and content are extracted with an automatic recognition system.

- **Summary**: Visual dialogue is a challenging task since it needs to answer a series of coherent questions on the basis of understanding the visual environment. Previous studies focus on the implicit exploration of multimodal co-reference by implicitly attending to spatial image features or object-level image features but neglect the importance of locating the objects explicitly in the visual content, which is associated with entities in the textual content. Therefore, in this paper we propose a {\bf M}ultimodal {\bf I}ncremental {\bf T}ransformer with {\bf V}isual {\bf G}rounding, named MITVG, which consists of two key parts: visual grounding and multimodal incremental transformer. Visual grounding aims to explicitly locate related objects in the image guided by textual entities, which helps the model exclude the visual content that does not need attention. On the basis of visual grounding, the multimodal incremental transformer encodes the multi-turn dialogue history combined with visual scene step by step according to the order of the dialogue and then generates a contextually and visually coherent response. Experimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which achieves comparable performance.

- **Summary**: Objectives: To develop an image-based automatic deep learning method to classify cardiac MR images by sequence type and imaging plane for improved clinical post-processing efficiency. Methods: Multi-vendor cardiac MRI studies were retrospectively collected from 4 centres and 3 vendors. A two-head convolutional neural network ('CardiSort') was trained to classify 35 sequences by imaging sequence (n=17) and plane (n=10). Single vendor training (SVT) on single centre images (n=234 patients) and multi-vendor training (MVT) with multicentre images (n = 479 patients, 3 centres) was performed. Model accuracy was compared to manual ground truth labels by an expert radiologist on a hold-out test set for both SVT and MVT. External validation of MVT (MVTexternal) was performed on data from 3 previously unseen magnet systems from 2 vendors (n=80 patients). Results: High sequence and plane accuracies were observed for SVT (85.2% and 93.2% respectively), and MVT (96.5% and 98.1% respectively) on the hold-out test set. MVTexternal yielded sequence accuracy of 92.7% and plane accuracy of 93.0%. There was high accuracy for common sequences and conventional cardiac planes. Poor accuracy was observed for underrepresented classes and sequences where there was greater variability in acquisition parameters across centres, such as perfusion imaging. Conclusions: A deep learning network was developed on multivendor data to classify MRI studies into component sequences and planes, with external validation. With refinement, it has potential to improve workflow by enabling automated sequence selection, an important first step in completely automated post-processing pipelines.

- **Summary**: We consider the navigation of mobile robots in crowded environments, for which onboard sensing of the crowd is typically limited by occlusions. We address the problem of inferring the human occupancy in the space around the robot, in blind spots, beyond the range of its sensing capabilities. This problem is rather unexplored in spite of the important impact it has on the robot crowd navigation efficiency and safety, which requires the estimation and the prediction of the crowd state around it. In this work, we propose the first solution to sample predictions of possible human presence based on the state of a fewer set of sensed people around the robot as well as previous observations of the crowd activity.

- **Summary**: Semantic understanding of 3D point clouds is important for various robotics applications. Given that point-wise semantic annotation is expensive, in this paper, we address the challenge of learning models with extremely sparse labels. The core problem is how to leverage numerous unlabeled points. To this end, we propose a self-supervised 3D representation learning framework named viewpoint bottleneck. It optimizes a mutual-information based objective, which is applied on point clouds under different viewpoints. A principled analysis shows that viewpoint bottleneck leads to an elegant surrogate loss function that is suitable for large-scale point cloud data. Compared with former arts based upon contrastive learning, viewpoint bottleneck operates on the feature dimension instead of the sample dimension. This paradigm shift has several advantages: It is easy to implement and tune, does not need negative samples and performs better on our goal down-streaming task. We evaluate our method on the public benchmark ScanNet, under the pointly-supervised setting. We achieve the best quantitative results among comparable solutions. Meanwhile we provide an extensive qualitative inspection on various challenging scenes. They demonstrate that our models can produce fairly good scene parsing results for robotics applications. Our code, data and models will be made public.

- **Summary**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides state-of-the-art results when trained on well-curated datasets with annotated labels. However, annotating data or even having balanced number of samples can be a luxury for practitioners from different scientific fields, e.g., in the medical domain. To that end, we propose a NAS-based framework that bears the threefold contributions: (a) we focus on the self-supervised scenario, i.e., where no labels are required to determine the architecture, and (b) we assume the datasets are imbalanced, (c) we design each component to be able to run on a resource constrained setup, i.e., on a single GPU (e.g. Google Colab). Our components build on top of recent developments in self-supervised learning~\citep{zbontar2021barlow}, self-supervised NAS~\citep{kaplan2020self} and extend them for the case of imbalanced datasets. We conduct experiments on an (artificially) imbalanced version of CIFAR-10 and we demonstrate our proposed method outperforms standard neural networks, while using $27\times$ less parameters. To validate our assumption on a naturally imbalanced dataset, we also conduct experiments on ChestMNIST and COVID-19 X-ray. The results demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in imbalanced datasets, while it can be fully run on a single GPU.

- **Summary**: GANs are able to perform generation and manipulation tasks, trained on a single video. However, these single video GANs require unreasonable amount of time to train on a single video, rendering them almost impractical. In this paper we question the necessity of a GAN for generation from a single video, and introduce a non-parametric baseline for a variety of generation and manipulation tasks. We revive classical space-time patches-nearest-neighbors approaches and adapt them to a scalable unconditional generative model, without any learning. This simple baseline surprisingly outperforms single-video GANs in visual quality and realism (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative evaluations), and is disproportionately faster (runtime reduced from several days to seconds). Other than diverse video generation, we demonstrate other applications using the same framework, including video analogies and spatio-temporal retargeting. Our proposed approach is easily scaled to Full-HD videos. These observations show that the classical approaches, if adapted correctly, significantly outperform heavy deep learning machinery for these tasks. This sets a new baseline for single-video generation and manipulation tasks, and no less important -- makes diverse generation from a single video practically possible for the first time.

- **Summary**: Following the success of deep learning in a wide range of applications, neural network-based machine-learning techniques have received significant interest for accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition and reconstruction strategies. A number of ideas inspired by deep learning techniques for computer vision and image processing have been successfully applied to nonlinear image reconstruction in the spirit of compressed sensing for accelerated MRI. Given the rapidly growing nature of the field, it is imperative to consolidate and summarize the large number of deep learning methods that have been reported in the literature, to obtain a better understanding of the field in general. This article provides an overview of the recent developments in neural-network based approaches that have been proposed specifically for improving parallel imaging. A general background and introduction to parallel MRI is also given from a classical view of k-space based reconstruction methods. Image domain based techniques that introduce improved regularizers are covered along with k-space based methods which focus on better interpolation strategies using neural networks. While the field is rapidly evolving with plenty of papers published each year, in this review, we attempt to cover broad categories of methods that have shown good performance on publicly available data sets. Limitations and open problems are also discussed and recent efforts for producing open data sets and benchmarks for the community are examined.

- **Summary**: Manual rib inspections in computed tomography (CT) scans are clinically critical but labor-intensive, as 24 ribs are typically elongated and oblique in 3D volumes. Automatic rib segmentation methods can speed up the process through rib measurement and visualization. However, prior arts mostly use in-house labeled datasets that are publicly unavailable and work on dense 3D volumes that are computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we develop a labeled rib segmentation benchmark, named \emph{RibSeg}, including 490 CT scans (11,719 individual ribs) from a public dataset. For ground truth generation, we used existing morphology-based algorithms and manually refined its results. Then, considering the sparsity of ribs in 3D volumes, we thresholded and sampled sparse voxels from the input and designed a point cloud-based baseline method for rib segmentation. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (Dice~$\approx95\%$) with significant efficiency ($10\sim40\times$ faster than prior arts). The RibSeg dataset, code, and model in PyTorch are available at https://github.com/M3DV/RibSeg.

- **Summary**: Modeling 3D context is essential for high-performance 3D medical image analysis. Although 2D networks benefit from large-scale 2D supervised pretraining, it is weak in capturing 3D context. 3D networks are strong in 3D context yet lack supervised pretraining. As an emerging technique, \emph{3D context fusion operator}, which enables conversion from 2D pretrained networks, leverages the advantages of both and has achieved great success. Existing 3D context fusion operators are designed to be spatially symmetric, i.e., performing identical operations on each 2D slice like convolutions. However, these operators are not truly equivariant to translation, especially when only a few 3D slices are used as inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel asymmetric 3D context fusion operator (A3D), which uses different weights to fuse 3D context from different 2D slices. Notably, A3D is NOT translation-equivariant while it significantly outperforms existing symmetric context fusion operators without introducing large computational overhead. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by extensive experiments on DeepLesion benchmark, a large-scale public dataset for universal lesion detection from computed tomography (CT). The proposed A3D consistently outperforms symmetric context fusion operators by considerable margins, and establishes a new \emph{state of the art} on DeepLesion. To facilitate open research, our code and model in PyTorch are available at https://github.com/M3DV/AlignShift.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of labeled data is a major bottleneck for developing accurate and robust deep learning-based models for histopathology applications. The problem is notably prominent for the task of metastasis detection in lymph nodes, due to the tissue's low tumor-to-non-tumor ratio, resulting in labor- and time-intensive annotation processes for the pathologists. This work explores alternatives on how to augment the training data for colon carcinoma metastasis detection when there is limited or no representation of the target domain. Through an exhaustive study of cross-validated experiments with limited training data availability, we evaluate both an inter-organ approach utilizing already available data for other tissues, and an intra-organ approach, utilizing the primary tumor. Both these approaches result in little to no extra annotation effort. Our results show that these data augmentation strategies can be an efficient way of increasing accuracy on metastasis detection, but fore-most increase robustness.

- **Summary**: Segmentation is an essential requirement in medicine when digital images are used in illness diagnosis, especially, in posterior tasks as analysis and disease identification. An efficient segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) is of prime concern to radiologists due to their poor illumination and other conditions related to de acquisition of the images. Thresholding is a popular method for segmentation that uses the histogram of an image to label different homogeneous groups of pixels into different classes. However, the computational cost increases exponentially according to the number of thresholds. In this paper, we perform the multi-level thresholding using an evolutionary metaheuristic. It is an improved version of the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm that combines the chaotic initialization and the concept of altruism. Further, for fitness assignment, we use a hybrid objective function where along with the cross-entropy minimization, we apply a new entropy function, and leverage weights to the two objective functions to form a new hybrid approach. The HHO was originally designed to solve numerical optimization problems. Earlier, the statistical results and comparisons have demonstrated that the HHO provides very promising results compared with well-established metaheuristic techniques. In this article, the altruism has been incorporated into the HHO algorithm to enhance its exploitation capabilities. We evaluate the proposed method over 10 benchmark images from the WBA database of the Harvard Medical School and 8 benchmark images from the Brainweb dataset using some standard evaluation metrics.



### Realistic PointGoal Navigation via Auxiliary Losses and Information Bottleneck

- **Summary**: We propose a novel architecture and training paradigm for training realistic PointGoal Navigation -- navigating to a target coordinate in an unseen environment under actuation and sensor noise without access to ground-truth localization. Specifically, we find that the primary challenge under this setting is learning localization -- when stripped of idealized localization, agents fail to stop precisely at the goal despite reliably making progress towards it. To address this we introduce a set of auxiliary losses to help the agent learn localization. Further, we explore the idea of treating the precise location of the agent as privileged information -- it is unavailable during test time, however, it is available during training time in simulation. We grant the agent restricted access to ground-truth localization readings during training via an information bottleneck. Under this setting, the agent incurs a penalty for using this privileged information, encouraging the agent to only leverage this information when it is crucial to learning. This enables the agent to first learn navigation and then learn localization instead of conflating these two objectives in training. We evaluate our proposed method both in a semi-idealized (noiseless simulation without Compass+GPS) and realistic (addition of noisy simulation) settings. Specifically, our method outperforms existing baselines on the semi-idealized setting by 18\%/21\% SPL/Success and by 15\%/20\% SPL in the realistic setting. Our improved Success and SPL metrics indicate our agent's improved ability to accurately self-localize while maintaining a strong navigation policy. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/NicoGrande/habitat-pointnav-via-ib.

- **Summary**: We propose a new model for no-reference video quality assessment (VQA). Our approach uses a new idea of highly-localized space-time (ST) slices called Space-Time Chips (ST Chips). ST Chips are localized cuts of video data along directions that \textit{implicitly} capture motion. We use perceptually-motivated bandpass and normalization models to first process the video data, and then select oriented ST Chips based on how closely they fit parametric models of natural video statistics. We show that the parameters that describe these statistics can be used to reliably predict the quality of videos, without the need for a reference video. The proposed method implicitly models ST video naturalness, and deviations from naturalness. We train and test our model on several large VQA databases, and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance at reduced cost, without requiring motion computation.

- **Summary**: Most recent view-invariant action recognition and performance assessment approaches rely on a large amount of annotated 3D skeleton data to extract view-invariant features. However, acquiring 3D skeleton data can be cumbersome, if not impractical, in in-the-wild scenarios. To overcome this problem, we present a novel unsupervised approach that learns to extract view-invariant 3D human pose representation from a 2D image without using 3D joint data. Our model is trained by exploiting the intrinsic view-invariant properties of human pose between simultaneous frames from different viewpoints and their equivariant properties between augmented frames from the same viewpoint. We evaluate the learned view-invariant pose representations for two downstream tasks. We perform comparative experiments that show improvements on the state-of-the-art unsupervised cross-view action classification accuracy on NTU RGB+D by a significant margin, on both RGB and depth images. We also show the efficiency of transferring the learned representations from NTU RGB+D to obtain the first ever unsupervised cross-view and cross-subject rank correlation results on the multi-view human movement quality dataset, QMAR, and marginally improve on the-state-of-the-art supervised results for this dataset. We also carry out ablation studies to examine the contributions of the different components of our proposed network.

- **Summary**: Auto white balance (AWB) is applied by camera hardware at capture time to remove the color cast caused by the scene illumination. The vast majority of white-balance algorithms assume a single light source illuminates the scene; however, real scenes often have mixed lighting conditions. This paper presents an effective AWB method to deal with such mixed-illuminant scenes. A unique departure from conventional AWB, our method does not require illuminant estimation, as is the case in traditional camera AWB modules. Instead, our method proposes to render the captured scene with a small set of predefined white-balance settings. Given this set of rendered images, our method learns to estimate weighting maps that are used to blend the rendered images to generate the final corrected image. Through extensive experiments, we show this proposed method produces promising results compared to other alternatives for single- and mixed-illuminant scene color correction.

- **Summary**: The transition to green energy grids depends on detailed wind and solar forecasts to optimize the siting and scheduling of renewable energy generation. Operational forecasts from numerical weather prediction models, however, only have a spatial resolution of 10 to 20-km, which leads to sub-optimal usage and development of renewable energy farms. Weather scientists have been developing super-resolution methods to increase the resolution, but often rely on simple interpolation techniques or computationally expensive differential equation-based models. Recently, machine learning-based models, specifically the physics-informed resolution-enhancing generative adversarial network (PhIREGAN), have outperformed traditional downscaling methods. We provide a thorough and extensible benchmark of leading deep learning-based super-resolution techniques, including the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) and an enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) network, on wind and solar data. We accompany the benchmark with a novel public, processed, and machine learning-ready dataset for benchmarking super-resolution methods on wind and solar data.

- **Summary**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) images are the ones that contain a greater range of luminosity as compared to the standard images. HDR images have a higher detail and clarity of structure, objects, and color, which the standard images lack. HDR images are useful in capturing scenes that pose high brightness, darker areas, and shadows, etc. An HDR image comprises multiple narrow-range-exposure images combined into one high-quality image. As these HDR images cannot be displayed on standard display devices, the real challenge comes while converting these HDR images to Low dynamic range (LDR) images. The conversion of HDR image to LDR image is performed using Tone-mapped operators (TMOs). This conversion results in the loss of much valuable information in structure, color, naturalness, and exposures. The loss of information in the LDR image may not directly be visible to the human eye. To calculate how good an LDR image is after conversion, various metrics have been proposed previously. Some are not noise resilient, some work on separate color channels (Red, Green, and Blue one by one), and some lack capacity to identify the structure. To deal with this problem, we propose a metric in this paper called the Tone Mapping Quality Index (TMQI-3), which evaluates the quality of the LDR image based on its objective score. TMQI-3 is noise resilient, takes account of structure and naturalness, and works on all three color channels combined into one luminosity component. This eliminates the need to use multiple metrics at the same time. We compute results for several HDR and LDR images from the literature and show that our quality index metric performs better than the baseline models.

- **Summary**: From photorealistic sketches to schematic diagrams, drawing provides a versatile medium for communicating about the visual world. How do images spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning? Do viewers understand drawings based solely on their ability to resemble the entities they refer to (i.e., as images), or do they understand drawings based on shared but arbitrary associations with these entities (i.e., as symbols)? In this paper, we provide evidence for a cognitive account of pictorial meaning in which both visual and social information is integrated to support effective visual communication. To evaluate this account, we used a communication task where pairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a target object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues across three experiments and a full internal replication, finding pairs of participants develop referent-specific and interaction-specific strategies for communicating more efficiently over time, going beyond what could be explained by either task practice or a pure resemblance-based account alone. Using a combination of model-based image analyses and crowdsourced sketch annotations, we further determined that drawings did not drift toward arbitrariness, as predicted by a pure convention-based account, but systematically preserved those visual features that were most distinctive of the target object. Taken together, these findings advance theories of pictorial meaning and have implications for how successful graphical conventions emerge via complex interactions between visual perception, communicative experience, and social context.

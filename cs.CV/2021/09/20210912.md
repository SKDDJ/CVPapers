- **Summary**: Deep learning has been successfully appertained to solve various complex problems in the area of big data analytics to computer vision. A deep learning-powered application recently emerged is Deep Fake. It helps to create fake images and videos that human cannot distinguish them from the real ones and are recent off-shelf manipulation technique that allows swapping two identities in a single video. Technology is a controversial technology with many wide-reaching issues impacting society. So, to counter this emerging problem, we introduce a dataset of 140k real and fake faces which contain 70k real faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from 1 million fake faces generated by style GAN. We will train our model in the dataset so that our model can identify real or fake faces.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the evolution of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has been remarkable, and its application to various fields has been growing rapidly. In this paper, I report the results of the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically video-to-video translation networks, to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The purpose of this research is to reduce the computational cost of CFD simulations with GANs. The architecture of GANs in this research is a combination of the image-to-image translation networks (the so-called "pix2pix") and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). It is shown that the results of high-cost and high-accuracy simulations (with high-resolution computational grids) can be estimated from those of low-cost and low-accuracy simulations (with low-resolution grids). In particular, the time evolution of density distributions in the cases of a high-resolution grid is reproduced from that in the cases of a low-resolution grid through GANs, and the density inhomogeneity estimated from the image generated by GANs recovers the ground truth with good accuracy. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the results of the proposed method with those of several super-resolution algorithms are also presented.

- **Summary**: Transformers have sprung up in the field of computer vision. In this work, we explore whether the core self-attention module in Transformer is the key to achieving excellent performance in image recognition. To this end, we build an attention-free network called sMLPNet based on the existing MLP-based vision models. Specifically, we replace the MLP module in the token-mixing step with a novel sparse MLP (sMLP) module. For 2D image tokens, sMLP applies 1D MLP along the axial directions and the parameters are shared among rows or columns. By sparse connection and weight sharing, sMLP module significantly reduces the number of model parameters and computational complexity, avoiding the common over-fitting problem that plagues the performance of MLP-like models. When only trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, the proposed sMLPNet achieves 81.9% top-1 accuracy with only 24M parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision Transformers under the same model size constraint. When scaling up to 66M parameters, sMLPNet achieves 83.4% top-1 accuracy, which is on par with the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer. The success of sMLPNet suggests that the self-attention mechanism is not necessarily a silver bullet in computer vision.

- **Summary**: A resource-adaptive supernet adjusts its subnets for inference to fit the dynamically available resources. In this paper, we propose prioritized subnet sampling to train a resource-adaptive supernet, termed PSS-Net. We maintain multiple subnet pools, each of which stores the information of substantial subnets with similar resource consumption. Considering a resource constraint, subnets conditioned on this resource constraint are sampled from a pre-defined subnet structure space and high-quality ones will be inserted into the corresponding subnet pool. Then, the sampling will gradually be prone to sampling subnets from the subnet pools. Moreover, the one with a better performance metric is assigned with higher priority to train our PSS-Net, if sampling is from a subnet pool. At the end of training, our PSS-Net retains the best subnet in each pool to entitle a fast switch of high-quality subnets for inference when the available resources vary. Experiments on ImageNet using MobileNet-V1/V2 and ResNet-50 show that our PSS-Net can well outperform state-of-the-art resource-adaptive supernets.

- **Summary**: Internet search affects people's cognition of the world, so mitigating biases in search results and learning fair models is imperative for social good. We study a unique gender bias in image search in this work: the search images are often gender-imbalanced for gender-neutral natural language queries. We diagnose two typical image search models, the specialized model trained on in-domain datasets and the generalized representation model pre-trained on massive image and text data across the internet. Both models suffer from severe gender bias. Therefore, we introduce two novel debiasing approaches: an in-processing fair sampling method to address the gender imbalance issue for training models, and a post-processing feature clipping method base on mutual information to debias multimodal representations of pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks show that our methods significantly reduce the gender bias in image search models.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art methods for driving-scene LiDAR-based perception (including point cloud semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation and 3D detection, \etc) often project the point clouds to 2D space and then process them via 2D convolution. Although this cooperation shows the competitiveness in the point cloud, it inevitably alters and abandons the 3D topology and geometric relations. A natural remedy is to utilize the 3D voxelization and 3D convolution network. However, we found that in the outdoor point cloud, the improvement obtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is the property of the outdoor point cloud, namely sparsity and varying density. Motivated by this investigation, we propose a new framework for the outdoor LiDAR segmentation, where cylindrical partition and asymmetrical 3D convolution networks are designed to explore the 3D geometric pattern while maintaining these inherent properties. The proposed model acts as a backbone and the learned features from this model can be used for downstream tasks such as point cloud semantic and panoptic segmentation or 3D detection. In this paper, we benchmark our model on these three tasks. For semantic segmentation, we evaluate the proposed model on several large-scale datasets, \ie, SemanticKITTI, nuScenes and A2D2. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art on the leaderboard of SemanticKITTI (both single-scan and multi-scan challenge), and significantly outperforms existing methods on nuScenes and A2D2 dataset. Furthermore, the proposed 3D framework also shows strong performance and good generalization on LiDAR panoptic segmentation and LiDAR 3D detection.

- **Summary**: Direct automatic segmentation of objects from 3D medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, is challenging as it often involves accurately identifying a number of individual objects with complex geometries within a large volume under investigation. To address these challenges, most deep learning approaches typically enhance their learning capability by substantially increasing the complexity or the number of trainable parameters within their models. Consequently, these models generally require long inference time on standard workstations operating clinical MR systems and are restricted to high-performance computing hardware due to their large memory requirement. Further, to fit 3D dataset through these large models using limited computer memory, trade-off techniques such as patch-wise training are often used which sacrifice the fine-scale geometric information from input images which could be clinically significant for diagnostic purposes. To address these challenges, we present a compact convolutional neural network with a shallow memory footprint to efficiently reduce the number of model parameters required for state-of-art performance. This is critical for practical employment as most clinical environments only have low-end hardware with limited computing power and memory. The proposed network can maintain data integrity by directly processing large full-size 3D input volumes with no patches required and significantly reduces the computational time required for both training and inference. We also propose a novel loss function with extra shape constraint to improve the accuracy for imbalanced classes in 3D MR images.

- **Summary**: One of the most common problems encountered in human-computer interaction is automatic facial expression recognition. Although it is easy for human observer to recognize facial expressions, automatic recognition remains difficult for machines. One of the methods that machines can recognize facial expression is analyzing the changes in face during facial expression presentation. In this paper, optical flow algorithm was used to extract deformation or motion vectors created in the face because of facial expressions. Then, these extracted motion vectors are used to be analyzed. Their positions and directions were exploited for automatic facial expression recognition using different data mining techniques. It means that by employing motion vector features used as our data, facial expressions were recognized. Some of the most state-of-the-art classification algorithms such as C5.0, CRT, QUEST, CHAID, Deep Learning (DL), SVM and Discriminant algorithms were used to classify the extracted motion vectors. Using 10-fold cross validation, their performances were calculated. To compare their performance more precisely, the test was repeated 50 times. Meanwhile, the deformation of face was also analyzed in this research. For example, what exactly happened in each part of face when a person showed fear? Experimental results on Extended Cohen-Kanade (CK+) facial expression dataset demonstrated that the best methods were DL, SVM and C5.0, with the accuracy of 95.3%, 92.8% and 90.2% respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an end-to-end Efficient Re-parameterizationResidual Attention Network(ERRA-Net) to directly restore the nonhomogeneous hazy image. The contribution of this paper mainly has the following three aspects: 1) A novel Multi-branch Attention (MA) block. The spatial attention mechanism better reconstructs high-frequency features, and the channel attention mechanism treats the features of different channels differently. Multi-branch structure dramatically improves the representation ability of the model and can be changed into a single path structure after re-parameterization to speed up the process of inference. Local Residual Connection allows the low-frequency information in the nonhomogeneous area to pass through the block without processing so that the block can focus on detailed features. 2) A lightweight network structure. We use cascaded MA blocks to extract high-frequency features step by step, and the Multi-layer attention fusion tail combines the shallow and deep features of the model to get the residual of the clean image finally. 3)We propose two novel loss functions to help reconstruct the hazy image ColorAttenuation loss and Laplace Pyramid loss. ERRA-Net has an impressive speed, processing 1200x1600 HD quality images with an average runtime of 166.11 fps. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ERSANet performs favorably against the SOTA approaches on the real-world hazy images.

- **Summary**: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) caused by prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a series of cranio-facial anomalies, and behavioral and neurocognitive problems. Current diagnosis of FAS is typically done by identifying a set of facial characteristics, which are often obtained by manual examination. Anatomical landmark detection, which provides rich geometric information, is important to detect the presence of FAS associated facial anomalies. This imaging application is characterized by large variations in data appearance and limited availability of labeled data. Current deep learning-based heatmap regression methods designed for facial landmark detection in natural images assume availability of large datasets and are therefore not wellsuited for this application. To address this restriction, we develop a new regularized transfer learning approach that exploits the knowledge of a network learned on large facial recognition datasets. In contrast to standard transfer learning which focuses on adjusting the pre-trained weights, the proposed learning approach regularizes the model behavior. It explicitly reuses the rich visual semantics of a domain-similar source model on the target task data as an additional supervisory signal for regularizing landmark detection optimization. Specifically, we develop four regularization constraints for the proposed transfer learning, including constraining the feature outputs from classification and intermediate layers, as well as matching activation attention maps in both spatial and channel levels. Experimental evaluation on a collected clinical imaging dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve model generalizability under limited training samples, and is advantageous to other approaches in the literature.

- **Summary**: Estimating the articulated 3D hand-object pose from a single RGB image is a highly ambiguous and challenging problem, requiring large-scale datasets that contain diverse hand poses, object types, and camera viewpoints. Most real-world datasets lack these diversities. In contrast, data synthesis can easily ensure those diversities separately. However, constructing both valid and diverse hand-object interactions and efficiently learning from the vast synthetic data is still challenging. To address the above issues, we propose ArtiBoost, a lightweight online data enhancement method. ArtiBoost can cover diverse hand-object poses and camera viewpoints through sampling in a Composited hand-object Configuration and Viewpoint space (CCV-space) and can adaptively enrich the current hard-discernable items by loss-feedback and sample re-weighting. ArtiBoost alternatively performs data exploration and synthesis within a learning pipeline, and those synthetic data are blended into real-world source data for training. We apply ArtiBoost on a simple learning baseline network and witness the performance boost on several hand-object benchmarks. Our models and code are available at https://github.com/lixiny/ArtiBoost.

- **Summary**: The utilization of prior knowledge about anomalies is an essential issue for anomaly detections. Recently, the visual attention mechanism has become a promising way to improve the performance of CNNs for some computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Layer-wise External Attention Network (LEA-Net) for efficient image anomaly detection. The core idea relies on the integration of unsupervised and supervised anomaly detectors via the visual attention mechanism. Our strategy is as follows: (i) Prior knowledge about anomalies is represented as the anomaly map generated by unsupervised learning of normal instances, (ii) The anomaly map is translated to an attention map by the external network, (iii) The attention map is then incorporated into intermediate layers of the anomaly detection network. Notably, this layer-wise external attention can be applied to any CNN model in an end-to-end training manner. For a pilot study, we validate LEA-Net on color anomaly detection tasks. Through extensive experiments on PlantVillage, MVTec AD, and Cloud datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed layer-wise visual attention mechanism consistently boosts anomaly detection performances of an existing CNN model, even on imbalanced datasets. Moreover, we show that our attention mechanism successfully boosts the performance of several CNN models.



### A Complex Constrained Total Variation Image Denoising Algorithm with Application to Phase Retrieval

- **Summary**: This paper considers the constrained total variation (TV) denoising problem for complex-valued images. We extend the definition of TV seminorms for real-valued images to dealing with complex-valued ones. In particular, we introduce two types of complex TV in both isotropic and anisotropic forms. To solve the constrained denoising problem, we adopt a dual approach and derive an accelerated gradient projection algorithm. We further generalize the proposed denoising algorithm as a key building block of the proximal gradient scheme to solve a vast class of complex constrained optimization problems with TV regularizers. As an example, we apply the proposed algorithmic framework to phase retrieval. We combine the complex TV regularizer with the conventional projection-based method within the constraint complex TV model. Initial results from both simulated and optical experiments demonstrate the validity of the constrained TV model in extracting sparsity priors within complex-valued images, while also utilizing physically tractable constraints that help speed up convergence.



### Check Your Other Door! Creating Backdoor Attacks in the Frequency Domain

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are ubiquitous and span a variety of applications ranging from image classification to real-time object detection. As DNN models become more sophisticated, the computational cost of training these models becomes a burden. For this reason, outsourcing the training process has been the go-to option for many DNN users. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of vulnerability to backdoor attacks. These attacks aim to establish hidden backdoors in the DNN so that it performs well on clean samples, but outputs a particular target label when a trigger is applied to the input. Existing backdoor attacks either generate triggers in the spatial domain or naively poison frequencies in the Fourier domain. In this work, we propose a pipeline based on Fourier heatmaps to generate a spatially dynamic and invisible backdoor attack in the frequency domain. The proposed attack is extensively evaluated on various datasets and network architectures. Unlike most existing backdoor attacks, the proposed attack can achieve high attack success rates with low poisoning rates and little to no drop in performance while remaining imperceptible to the human eye. Moreover, we show that the models poisoned by our attack are resistant to various state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses, so we contribute two possible defenses that can evade the attack.

- **Summary**: In the future, extraterrestrial expeditions will not only be conducted by rovers but also by flying robots. The technical demonstration drone Ingenuity, that just landed on Mars, will mark the beginning of a new era of exploration unhindered by terrain traversability. Robust self-localization is crucial for that. Cameras that are lightweight, cheap and information-rich sensors are already used to estimate the ego-motion of vehicles. However, methods proven to work in man-made environments cannot simply be deployed on other planets. The highly repetitive textures present in the wastelands of Mars pose a huge challenge to descriptor matching based approaches.   In this paper, we present an advanced robust monocular odometry algorithm that uses efficient optical flow tracking to obtain feature correspondences between images and a refined keyframe selection criterion. In contrast to most other approaches, our framework can also handle rotation-only motions that are particularly challenging for monocular odometry systems. Furthermore, we present a novel approach to estimate the current risk of scale drift based on a principal component analysis of the relative translation information matrix. This way we obtain an implicit measure of uncertainty. We evaluate the validity of our approach on all sequences of a challenging real-world dataset captured in a Mars-like environment and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Existing research for image text retrieval mainly relies on sentence-level supervision to distinguish matched and mismatched sentences for a query image. However, semantic mismatch between an image and sentences usually happens in finer grain, i.e., phrase level. In this paper, we explore to introduce additional phrase-level supervision for the better identification of mismatched units in the text. In practice, multi-grained semantic labels are automatically constructed for a query image in both sentence-level and phrase-level. We construct text scene graphs for the matched sentences and extract entities and triples as the phrase-level labels. In order to integrate both supervision of sentence-level and phrase-level, we propose Semantic Structure Aware Multimodal Transformer (SSAMT) for multi-modal representation learning. Inside the SSAMT, we utilize different kinds of attention mechanisms to enforce interactions of multi-grain semantic units in both sides of vision and language. For the training, we propose multi-scale matching losses from both global and local perspectives, and penalize mismatched phrases.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, deep learning is the standard approach for a wide range of problems, including biometrics, such as face recognition and speech recognition, etc. Biometric problems often use deep learning models to extract features from images, also known as embeddings. Moreover, the loss function used during training strongly influences the quality of the generated embeddings. In this work, a loss function based on the decidability index is proposed to improve the quality of embeddings for the verification routine. Our proposal, the D-loss, avoids some Triplet-based loss disadvantages such as the use of hard samples and tricky parameter tuning, which can lead to slow convergence. The proposed approach is compared against the Softmax (cross-entropy), Triplets Soft-Hard, and the Multi Similarity losses in four different benchmarks: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10 and CASIA-IrisV4. The achieved results show the efficacy of the proposal when compared to other popular metrics in the literature. The D-loss computation, besides being simple, non-parametric and easy to implement, favors both the inter-class and intra-class scenarios.

- **Summary**: Digital image watermarking, which is a technique for invisibly embedding information into an image, is used in fields such as property rights protection. In recent years, some research has proposed the use of neural networks to add watermarks to natural images. We take StegaStamp as an example for our research. Whether facing traditional image editing methods, such as brightness, contrast, saturation adjustment, or style change like 1-bit conversion, GAN, StegaStamp has robustness far beyond traditional watermarking techniques, but it still has two drawbacks: it is vulnerable to cropping and is hard to train. We found that the causes of vulnerability to cropping is not the loss of information on the edge, but the movement of watermark position. By explicitly introducing the perturbation of cropping into the training, the cropping resistance is significantly improved. For the problem of difficult training, we introduce instance normalization to solve the vanishing gradient, set losses' weights as learnable parameters to reduce the number of hyperparameters, and use sigmoid to restrict pixel values of the generated image.

- **Summary**: The fingerprint classification is an important and effective method to quicken the process and improve the accuracy in the fingerprint matching process. Conventional supervised methods need a large amount of pre-labeled data and thus consume immense human resources. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient unsupervised deep learning method that can extract fingerprint features and classify fingerprint patterns automatically. In this approach, a new model named constraint convolutional auto-encoder (CCAE) is used to extract fingerprint features and a hybrid clustering strategy is applied to obtain the final clusters. A set of experiments in the NIST-DB4 dataset shows that the proposed unsupervised method exhibits the efficient performance on fingerprint classification. For example, the CCAE achieves an accuracy of 97.3% on only 1000 unlabeled fingerprints in the NIST-DB4.

- **Summary**: In Domain Adaptation (DA), where the feature distributions of the source and target domains are different, various distance-based methods have been proposed to minimize the discrepancy between the source and target domains to handle the domain shift. In this paper, we propose a new similarity function, which is called Population Correlation (PC), to measure the domain discrepancy for DA. Base on the PC function, we propose a new method called Domain Adaptation by Maximizing Population Correlation (DAMPC) to learn a domain-invariant feature representation for DA. Moreover, most existing DA methods use hand-crafted bottleneck networks, which may limit the capacity and flexibility of the corresponding model. Therefore, we further propose a method called DAMPC with Neural Architecture Search (DAMPC-NAS) to search the optimal network architecture for DAMPC. Experiments on several benchmark datasets, including Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA-2017, show that the proposed DAMPC-NAS method achieves better results than state-of-the-art DA methods.

- **Summary**: Many previous methods on text-based person retrieval tasks are devoted to learning a latent common space mapping, with the purpose of extracting modality-invariant features from both visual and textual modality. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES. To properly evaluate our proposed DSSL in the real scenarios, a Real Scenarios Text-based Person Reidentification (RSTPReid) dataset is constructed to benefit future research on text-based person retrieval, which will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Brain-inspired computation and information processing alongside compatibility with neuromorphic hardware have made spiking neural networks (SNN) a promising method for solving learning tasks in machine learning (ML). Spiking neurons are only one of the requirements for building a bio-plausible learning model. Network architecture and learning rules are other important factors to consider when developing such artificial agents. In this work, inspired by the human visual pathway and the role of dopamine in learning, we propose a reward-modulated locally connected spiking neural network, BioLCNet, for visual learning tasks. To extract visual features from Poisson-distributed spike trains, we used local filters that are more analogous to the biological visual system compared to convolutional filters with weight sharing. In the decoding layer, we applied a spike population-based voting scheme to determine the decision of the network. We employed Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for learning the visual features, and its reward-modulated variant (R-STDP) for training the decoder based on the reward or punishment feedback signal. For evaluation, we first assessed the robustness of our rewarding mechanism to varying target responses in a classical conditioning experiment. Afterwards, we evaluated the performance of our network on image classification tasks of MNIST and XOR MNIST datasets.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (re-ID) has gained more and more attention due to its widespread applications in intelligent video surveillance. Unfortunately, the mainstream deep learning methods still need a large quantity of labeled data to train models, and annotating data is an expensive work in real-world scenarios. In addition, due to domain gaps between different datasets, the performance is dramatically decreased when re-ID models pre-trained on label-rich datasets (source domain) are directly applied to other unlabeled datasets (target domain). In this paper, we attempt to remedy these problems from two aspects, namely data and methodology. Firstly, we develop a data collector to automatically generate synthetic re-ID samples in a computer game, and construct a data labeler to simultaneously annotate them, which free humans from heavy data collections and annotations. Based on them, we build two synthetic person re-ID datasets with different scales, "GSPR" and "mini-GSPR" datasets. Secondly, we propose a synthesis-based multi-domain collaborative refinement (SMCR) network, which contains a synthetic pretraining module and two collaborative-refinement modules to implement sufficient learning for the valuable knowledge from multiple domains. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework obtains significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on multiple unsupervised domain adaptation tasks of person re-ID.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the deep face recognition problem under an open-set protocol, where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen metric space. To this end, hyperspherical face recognition, as a promising line of research, has attracted increasing attention and gradually become a major focus in face recognition research. As one of the earliest works in hyperspherical face recognition, SphereFace explicitly proposed to learn face embeddings with large inter-class angular margin. However, SphereFace still suffers from severe training instability which limits its application in practice. In order to address this problem, we introduce a unified framework to understand large angular margin in hyperspherical face recognition. Under this framework, we extend the study of SphereFace and propose an improved variant with substantially better training stability -- SphereFace-R. Specifically, we propose two novel ways to implement the multiplicative margin, and study SphereFace-R under three different feature normalization schemes (no feature normalization, hard feature normalization and soft feature normalization). We also propose an implementation strategy -- "characteristic gradient detachment" -- to stabilize training. Extensive experiments on SphereFace-R show that it is consistently better than or competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding from point clouds plays a vital role for various robotic applications. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art methods use separate neural networks for different tasks like object detection or room layout estimation. Such a scheme has two limitations: 1) Storing and running several networks for different tasks are expensive for typical robotic platforms. 2) The intrinsic structure of separate outputs are ignored and potentially violated. To this end, we propose the first transformer architecture that predicts 3D objects and layouts simultaneously, using point cloud inputs. Unlike existing methods that either estimate layout keypoints or edges, we directly parameterize room layout as a set of quads. As such, the proposed architecture is termed as P(oint)Q(uad)-Transformer. Along with the novel quad representation, we propose a tailored physical constraint loss function that discourages object-layout interference. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the public benchmark ScanNet show that the proposed PQ-Transformer succeeds to jointly parse 3D objects and layouts, running at a quasi-real-time (8.91 FPS) rate without efficiency-oriented optimization. Moreover, the new physical constraint loss can improve strong baselines, and the F1-score of the room layout is significantly promoted from 37.9% to 57.9%.

- **Summary**: Understanding movies and their structural patterns is a crucial task in decoding the craft of video editing. While previous works have developed tools for general analysis, such as detecting characters or recognizing cinematography properties at the shot level, less effort has been devoted to understanding the most basic video edit, the Cut. This paper introduces the Cut type recognition task, which requires modeling multi-modal information. To ignite research in this new task, we construct a large-scale dataset called MovieCuts, which contains 173,967 video clips labeled with ten cut types defined by professionals in the movie industry. We benchmark a set of audio-visual approaches, including some dealing with the problem's multi-modal nature. Our best model achieves 47.7% mAP, which suggests that the task is challenging and that attaining highly accurate Cut type recognition is an open research problem. Advances in automatic Cut-type recognition can unleash new experiences in the video editing industry, such as movie analysis for education, video re-editing, virtual cinematography, machine-assisted trailer generation, machine-assisted video editing, among others.

- **Summary**: We present a joint graph convolution-image convolution neural network as our submission to the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2021 challenge. We model each brain as a graph composed of distinct image regions, which is initially segmented by a graph neural network (GNN). Subsequently, the tumorous volume identified by the GNN is further refined by a simple (voxel) convolutional neural network (CNN), which produces the final segmentation. This approach captures both global brain feature interactions via the graphical representation and local image details through the use of convolutional filters. We find that the GNN component by itself can effectively identify and segment the brain tumors. The addition of the CNN further improves the median performance of the model by 2 percent across all metrics evaluated. On the validation set, our joint GNN-CNN model achieves mean Dice scores of 0.89, 0.81, 0.73 and mean Hausdorff distances (95th percentile) of 6.8, 12.6, 28.2mm on the whole tumor, core tumor, and enhancing tumor, respectively.

- **Summary**: Convolutional networks have been widely applied for computer vision system. Encouraged by these results, a U-Net convolutional network was applied to recognition of vessels and materials in chemistry lab using the recent Vector-LabPics dataset, which contains 2187 images of materials within mostly transparent vessels in a chemistry lab and other general settings, labeled with 13 classes. By optimizing hyperparameters including learning rates and learning rate decays, 87% accuracy in vessel recognition was achieved. In the case of relatively small training and test sets (relatively rare materials states, the number of training set samples less than 500 and the number of test set samples less than 100), a comprehensive improvement over 18% in IoU and 19% in accuracy for the best model were achieved. Further improvements may be achievable by incorporating improved convolutional network structure into our models.

- **Summary**: We introduce Multiresolution Deep Implicit Functions (MDIF), a hierarchical representation that can recover fine geometry detail, while being able to perform global operations such as shape completion. Our model represents a complex 3D shape with a hierarchy of latent grids, which can be decoded into different levels of detail and also achieve better accuracy. For shape completion, we propose latent grid dropout to simulate partial data in the latent space and therefore defer the completing functionality to the decoder side. This along with our multires design significantly improves the shape completion quality under decoder-only latent optimization. To the best of our knowledge, MDIF is the first deep implicit function model that can at the same time (1) represent different levels of detail and allow progressive decoding; (2) support both encoder-decoder inference and decoder-only latent optimization, and fulfill multiple applications; (3) perform detailed decoder-only shape completion. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance against prior art in various 3D reconstruction tasks.

- **Summary**: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) have been used in many image processing tasks. However, they still have serious problems maintaining the balance between conditioning the output on the input and creating the output with the desired distribution based on the corresponding ground truth. The traditional cGANs, similar to most conventional GANs, suffer from vanishing gradients, which backpropagate from the discriminator to the generator. Moreover, the traditional cGANs are sensitive to architectural changes due to previously mentioned gradient problems. Therefore, balancing the architecture of the cGANs is almost impossible. Recently MSG-GAN has been proposed to stabilize the performance of the GANs by applying multiple connections between the generator and discriminator. In this work, we propose a method called MSGDD-cGAN, which first stabilizes the performance of the cGANs using multi-connections gradients flow. Secondly, the proposed network architecture balances the correlation of the output to input and the fitness of the output on the target distribution. This balance is generated by using the proposed dual discrimination procedure. We tested our model by segmentation of fetal ultrasound images. Our model shows a 3.18% increase in the F1 score comparing to the pix2pix version of cGANs.

- **Summary**: Frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease are two common forms of dementia and are easily misdiagnosed as each other due to their similar pattern of clinical symptoms. Differentiating between the two dementia types is crucial for determining disease-specific intervention and treatment. Recent development of Deep-learning-based approaches in the field of medical image computing are delivering some of the best performance for many binary classification tasks, although its application in differential diagnosis, such as neuroimage-based differentiation for multiple types of dementia, has not been explored. In this study, a novel framework was proposed by using the Generative Adversarial Network technique to distinguish FTD, AD and normal control subjects, using volumetric features extracted at coarse-to-fine structural scales from Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans. Experiments of 10-folds cross-validation on 1,954 images achieved high accuracy. With the proposed framework, we have demonstrated that the combination of multi-scale structural features and synthetic data augmentation based on generative adversarial network can improve the performance of challenging tasks such as differentiating Dementia sub-types.

- **Summary**: Garments are ubiquitous in both real and many of the virtual worlds. They are highly deformable objects, exhibit an immense variety of designs and shapes, and yet, most garments are created from a set of regularly shaped flat pieces. Exploration of garment structure presents a peculiar case for an object structure estimation task and might prove useful for downstream tasks of neural 3D garment modeling and reconstruction by providing strong prior on garment shapes. To facilitate research in these directions, we propose a method for generating large synthetic datasets of 3D garment designs and their sewing patterns. Our method consists of a flexible description structure for specifying parametric sewing pattern templates and the automatic generation pipeline to produce garment 3D models with little-to-none manual intervention. To add realism, the pipeline additionally creates corrupted versions of the final meshes that imitate artifacts of 3D scanning.   With this pipeline, we created the first large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D garment models with their sewing patterns. The dataset contains more than 20000 garment design variations produced from 19 different base types. Seven of these garment types are specifically designed to target evaluation of the generalization across garment sewing pattern topologies.

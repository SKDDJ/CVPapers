- **Summary**: In surveillance and search and rescue applications, it is important to perform multi-target tracking (MOT) in real-time on low-end devices. Today's MOT solutions employ deep neural networks, which tend to have high computation complexity. Recognizing the effects of frame sizes on tracking performance, we propose DeepScale, a model agnostic frame size selection approach that operates on top of existing fully convolutional network-based trackers to accelerate tracking throughput. In the training stage, we incorporate detectability scores into a one-shot tracker architecture so that DeepScale can learn representation estimations for different frame sizes in a self-supervised manner. During inference, it can adapt frame sizes according to the complexity of visual contents based on user-controlled parameters. To leverage computation resources on edge servers, we propose two computation partition schemes tailored for MOT, namely, edge server only with adaptive frame-size transmission and edge server-assisted tracking. Extensive experiments and benchmark tests on MOT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DeepScale. Compared to a state-of-the-art tracker, DeepScale++, a variant of DeepScale achieves 1.57X accelerated with only moderate degradation ~2.3\ in tracking accuracy on the MOT15 dataset in one configuration. We have implemented and evaluated DeepScale++ and the proposed computation partition schemes on a small-scale testbed consisting of an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 board and a GPU server. The experiments reveal non-trivial trade-offs between tracking performance and latency compared to server-only or smart camera-only solutions.

- **Summary**: Contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as MoCo and SimCLR, have achieved great success in unsupervised visual representation learning. They rely on a large number of negative pairs and thus require either large memory banks or large batches. Some recent non-contrastive SSL methods, such as BYOL and SimSiam, attempt to discard negative pairs and have also shown remarkable performance. To avoid collapsed solutions caused by not using negative pairs, these methods require non-trivial asymmetry designs. However, in small data regimes, we can not obtain a sufficient number of negative pairs or effectively avoid the over-fitting problem when negatives are not used at all. To address this situation, we argue that negative pairs are still important but one is generally sufficient for each positive pair. We show that a simple Triplet-based loss (Trip) can achieve surprisingly good performance without requiring large batches or asymmetry designs. Moreover, to alleviate the over-fitting problem in small data regimes and further enhance the effect of Trip, we propose a simple plug-and-play RandOm MApping (ROMA) strategy by randomly mapping samples into other spaces and requiring these randomly projected samples to satisfy the same relationship indicated by the triplets. Integrating the triplet-based loss with random mapping, we obtain the proposed method Trip-ROMA. Extensive experiments, including unsupervised representation learning and unsupervised few-shot learning, have been conducted on ImageNet-1K and seven small datasets. They successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of Trip-ROMA and consistently show that ROMA can further effectively boost other SSL methods.

- **Summary**: Many RGB-T trackers attempt to attain robust feature representation by utilizing an adaptive weighting scheme (or attention mechanism). Different from these works, we propose a new dynamic modality-aware filter generation module (named MFGNet) to boost the message communication between visible and thermal data by adaptively adjusting the convolutional kernels for various input images in practical tracking. Given the image pairs as input, we first encode their features with the backbone network. Then, we concatenate these feature maps and generate dynamic modality-aware filters with two independent networks. The visible and thermal filters will be used to conduct a dynamic convolutional operation on their corresponding input feature maps respectively. Inspired by residual connection, both the generated visible and thermal feature maps will be summarized with input feature maps. The augmented feature maps will be fed into the RoI align module to generate instance-level features for subsequent classification. To address issues caused by heavy occlusion, fast motion and out-of-view, we propose to conduct a joint local and global search by exploiting a new direction-aware target driven attention mechanism. The spatial and temporal recurrent neural network is used to capture the direction-aware context for accurate global attention prediction. Extensive experiments on three large-scale RGB-T tracking benchmark datasets validated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: Crowdsourcing provides an efficient label collection schema for supervised machine learning. However, to control annotation cost, each instance in the crowdsourced data is typically annotated by a small number of annotators. This creates a sparsity issue and limits the quality of machine learning models trained on such data. In this paper, we study how to handle sparsity in crowdsourced data using data augmentation. Specifically, we propose to directly learn a classifier by augmenting the raw sparse annotations. We implement two principles of high-quality augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks: 1) the generated annotations should follow the distribution of authentic ones, which is measured by a discriminator; 2) the generated annotations should have high mutual information with the ground-truth labels, which is measured by an auxiliary network. Extensive experiments and comparisons against an array of state-of-the-art learning from crowds methods on three real-world datasets proved the effectiveness of our data augmentation framework. It shows the potential of our algorithm for low-budget crowdsourcing in general.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the CogSense system, which is inspired by sense-making cognition and perception in the mammalian brain to perform perception error detection and perception parameter adaptation using probabilistic signal temporal logic. As a specific application, a contrast-based perception adaption method is presented and validated. The proposed method evaluates perception errors using heterogeneous probe functions computed from the detected objects and subsequently solves a contrast optimization problem to correct perception errors. The CogSense probe functions utilize the characteristics of geometry, dynamics, and detected blob image quality of the objects to develop axioms in a probabilistic signal temporal logic framework. By evaluating these axioms, we can formally verify whether the detections are valid or erroneous. Further, using the CogSense axioms, we generate the probabilistic signal temporal logic-based constraints to finally solve the contrast-based optimization problem to reduce false positives and false negatives.

- **Summary**: Current methods of multi-person pose estimation typically treat the localization and the association of body joints separately. It is convenient but inefficient, leading to additional computation and a waste of time. This paper, however, presents a novel framework PoseDet (Estimating Pose by Detection) to localize and associate body joints simultaneously at higher inference speed. Moreover, we propose the keypoint-aware pose embedding to represent an object in terms of the locations of its keypoints. The proposed pose embedding contains semantic and geometric information, allowing us to access discriminative and informative features efficiently. It is utilized for candidate classification and body joint localization in PoseDet, leading to robust predictions of various poses. This simple framework achieves an unprecedented speed and a competitive accuracy on the COCO benchmark compared with state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the CrowdPose benchmark show the robustness in the crowd scenes. Source code is available.



### A Deep Learning-based Quality Assessment and Segmentation System with a Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Optical Coherence Tomographic Angiography Image

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive and non-contacting imaging technique providing visualization of microvasculature of retina and optic nerve head in human eyes in vivo. The adequate image quality of OCTA is the prerequisite for the subsequent quantification of retinal microvasculature. Traditionally, the image quality score based on signal strength is used for discriminating low quality. However, it is insufficient for identifying artefacts such as motion and off-centration, which rely specialized knowledge and need tedious and time-consuming manual identification. One of the most primary issues in OCTA analysis is to sort out the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) region in the retina, which highly correlates with any visual acuity disease. However, the variations in OCTA visual quality affect the performance of deep learning in any downstream marginally. Moreover, filtering the low-quality OCTA images out is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address these issues, we develop an automated computer-aided OCTA image processing system using deep neural networks as the classifier and segmentor to help ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis and research. This system can be an assistive tool as it can process OCTA images of different formats to assess the quality and segment the FAZ area. The source code is freely available at https://github.com/shanzha09/COIPS.git.   Another major contribution is the large-scale OCTA dataset, namely OCTA-25K-IQA-SEG we publicize for performance evaluation. It is comprised of four subsets, namely sOCTA-3$\times$3-10k, sOCTA-6$\times$6-14k, sOCTA-3$\times$3-1.1k-seg, and dOCTA-6$\times$6-1.1k-seg, which contains a total number of 25,665 images. The large-scale OCTA dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5111975, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5111972.



### Adaptive Dilated Convolution For Human Pose Estimation

- **Summary**: Most existing human pose estimation (HPE) methods exploit multi-scale information by fusing feature maps of four different spatial sizes, \ie $1/4$, $1/8$, $1/16$, and $1/32$ of the input image. There are two drawbacks of this strategy: 1) feature maps of different spatial sizes may be not well aligned spatially, which potentially hurts the accuracy of keypoint location; 2) these scales are fixed and inflexible, which may restrict the generalization ability over various human sizes. Towards these issues, we propose an adaptive dilated convolution (ADC). It can generate and fuse multi-scale features of the same spatial sizes by setting different dilation rates for different channels. More importantly, these dilation rates are generated by a regression module. It enables ADC to adaptively adjust the fused scales and thus ADC may generalize better to various human sizes. ADC can be end-to-end trained and easily plugged into existing methods. Extensive experiments show that ADC can bring consistent improvements to various HPE methods. The source codes will be released for further research.

- **Summary**: The aim of re-identification is to match objects in surveillance cameras with different viewpoints. Although ReID is developing at a considerably rapid pace, there is currently no processing method for the ReID task in multiple scenarios. However, such processing method is required in real life scenarios, such as those involving security. In the present study, a new ReID scenario was explored, which differs in terms of perspective, background, and pose(walking or cycling). Obviously, ordinary ReID processing methods cannot effectively handle such a scenario, with the introduction of image datasets being the optimal solution, in addition to being considerably expensive.   To solve the aforementioned problem, a simple and effective method to generate images in several new scenarios was proposed, which is names the Copy and Paste method based on Pose(CPP). The CPP method is based on key point detection, using copy as paste, to composite a new semantic image dataset in two different semantic image datasets. As an example, pedestrains and bicycles can be used to generate several images that show the same person riding on different bicycles. The CPP method is suitable for ReID tasks in new scenarios and outperforms the traditional methods when applied to the original datasets in original ReID tasks. To be specific, the CPP method can also perform better in terms of generalization for third-party public dataset. The Code and datasets composited by the CPP method will be available in the future.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance in a diverse range of machine learning applications. However, it is widely known that DNNs are vulnerable to simple adversarial perturbations, which causes the model to incorrectly classify inputs. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to detect adversarial examples, using methods developed to explain the model's behavior. Our key observation is that adding small, humanly imperceptible perturbations can lead to drastic changes in the model explanations, resulting in unusual or irregular forms of explanations. From this insight, we propose an unsupervised detection of adversarial examples using reconstructor networks trained only on model explanations of benign examples. Our evaluations with MNIST handwritten dataset show that our method is capable of detecting adversarial examples generated by the state-of-the-art algorithms with high confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first in suggesting unsupervised defense method using model explanations.

- **Summary**: Abstract reasoning, i.e., inferring complicated patterns from given observations, is a central building block of artificial general intelligence. While humans find the answer by either eliminating wrong candidates or first constructing the answer, prior deep neural network (DNN)-based methods focus on the former discriminative approach. This paper aims to design a framework for the latter approach and bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence. To this end, we propose logic-guided generation (LoGe), a novel generative DNN framework that reduces abstract reasoning as an optimization problem in propositional logic. LoGe is composed of three steps: extract propositional variables from images, reason the answer variables with a logic layer, and reconstruct the answer image from the variables. We demonstrate that LoGe outperforms the black box DNN frameworks for generative abstract reasoning under the RAVEN benchmark, i.e., reconstructing answers based on capturing correct rules of various attributes from observations.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a memory-based framework for real-time, data-efficient target analysis in forward-looking-sonar (FLS) imagery. Our framework relies on first removing non-discriminative details from the imagery using a small-scale DenseNet-inspired network. Doing so simplifies ensuing analyses and permits generalizing from few labeled examples. We then cascade the filtered imagery into a novel NeuralRAM-based convolutional matching network, NRMN, for low-shot target recognition. We employ a small-scale FlowNet, LFN to align and register FLS imagery across local temporal scales. LFN enables target label consensus voting across images and generally improves target detection and recognition rates.   We evaluate our framework using real-world FLS imagery with multiple broad target classes that have high intra-class variability and rich sub-class structure. We show that few-shot learning, with anywhere from ten to thirty class-specific exemplars, performs similarly to supervised deep networks trained on hundreds of samples per class. Effective zero-shot learning is also possible. High performance is realized from the inductive-transfer properties of NRMNs when distractor elements are removed.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional networks have become the mainstream in computer vision applications. Although CNNs have been successful in many computer vision tasks, it is not free from drawbacks. The performance of CNN is dramatically degraded by geometric transformation, such as large rotations. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture that can improve the robustness against geometric transformations without modifying the existing backbones of their CNNs. The key is to enclose the existing backbone with a geometric transformation (and the corresponding reverse transformation) and a feature map ensemble. The proposed method can inherit the strengths of existing CNNs that have been presented so far. Furthermore, the proposed method can be employed in combination with state-of-the-art data augmentation algorithms to improve their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using standard datasets such as CIFAR, CUB-200, and Mnist-rot-12k.



### Fristograms: Revealing and Exploiting Light Field Internals

- **Summary**: In recent years, light field (LF) capture and processing has become an integral part of media production. The richness of information available in LFs has enabled novel applications like post-capture depth-of-field editing, 3D reconstruction, segmentation and matting, saliency detection, object detection and recognition, and mixed reality. The efficacy of such applications depends on certain underlying requirements, which are often ignored. For example, some operations such as noise-reduction, or hyperfan-filtering are only possible if a scene point Lambertian radiator. Some other operations such as the removal of obstacles or looking behind objects are only possible if there is at least one ray capturing the required scene point. Consequently, the ray distribution representing a certain scene point is an important characteristic for evaluating processing possibilities. The primary idea in this paper is to establish a relation between the capturing setup and the rays of the LF. To this end, we discretize the view frustum. Traditionally, a uniform discretization of the view frustum results in voxels that represents a single sample on a regularly spaced, 3-D grid. Instead, we use frustum-shaped voxels (froxels), by using depth and capturing-setup dependent discretization of the view frustum. Based on such discretization, we count the number of rays mapping to the same pixel on the capturing device(s). By means of this count, we propose histograms of ray-counts over the froxels (fristograms). Fristograms can be used as a tool to analyze and reveal interesting aspects of the underlying LF, like the number of rays originating from a scene point and the color distribution of these rays. As an example, we show its ability by significantly reducing the number of rays which enables noise reduction while maintaining the realistic rendering of non-Lambertian or partially occluded regions.

- **Summary**: Previous approaches to generate shapes in a 3D setting train a GAN on the latent space of an autoencoder (AE). Even though this produces convincing results, it has two major shortcomings. As the GAN is limited to reproduce the dataset the AE was trained on, we cannot reuse a trained AE for novel data. Furthermore, it is difficult to add spatial supervision into the generation process, as the AE only gives us a global representation. To remedy these issues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell covers a part of a shape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector provided by an AE. This localized representation enables more expressiveness (since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as spatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes). Our method outperforms the current state of the art on all established evaluation measures, proposed for quantitatively evaluating the generative capabilities of GANs. We show limitations of these measures and propose the adaptation of a robust criterion from statistical analysis as an alternative.

- **Summary**: In pursuit of consolidating the face verification systems, prior face anti-spoofing studies excavate the hidden cues in original images to discriminate real persons and diverse attack types with the assistance of auxiliary supervision. However, limited by the following two inherent disturbances in their training process: 1) Complete facial structure in a single image. 2) Implicit subdomains in the whole dataset, these methods are prone to stick on memorization of the entire training dataset and show sensitivity to nonhomologous domain distribution. In this paper, we propose Structure Destruction Module and Content Combination Module to address these two imitations separately. The former mechanism destroys images into patches to construct a non-structural input, while the latter mechanism recombines patches from different subdomains or classes into a mixup construct. Based on this splitting-and-splicing operation, Local Relation Modeling Module is further proposed to model the second-order relationship between patches. We evaluate our method on extensive public datasets and promising experimental results to demonstrate the reliability of our method against state-of-the-art competitors.

- **Summary**: The visual anonymisation of sign language data is an essential task to address privacy concerns raised by large-scale dataset collection. Previous anonymisation techniques have either significantly affected sign comprehension or required manual, labour-intensive work.   In this paper, we formally introduce the task of Sign Language Video Anonymisation (SLVA) as an automatic method to anonymise the visual appearance of a sign language video whilst retaining the meaning of the original sign language sequence. To tackle SLVA, we propose AnonySign, a novel automatic approach for visual anonymisation of sign language data. We first extract pose information from the source video to remove the original signer appearance. We next generate a photo-realistic sign language video of a novel appearance from the pose sequence, using image-to-image translation methods in a conditional variational autoencoder framework. An approximate posterior style distribution is learnt, which can be sampled from to synthesise novel human appearances. In addition, we propose a novel \textit{style loss} that ensures style consistency in the anonymised sign language videos.   We evaluate AnonySign for the SLVA task with extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments highlighting both realism and anonymity of our novel human appearance synthesis. In addition, we formalise an anonymity perceptual study as an evaluation criteria for the SLVA task and showcase that video anonymisation using AnonySign retains the original sign language content.

- **Summary**: The Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire is commonly utilized for effective depression preliminary screening. The uncontrolled self-administered measure, on the other hand, maybe readily influenced by insouciant or dishonest responses, yielding different findings from the clinician-administered diagnostic. Facial expression (FE) and behaviors are important in clinician-administered assessments, but they are underappreciated in self-administered evaluations. We use a new dataset of 200 participants to demonstrate the validity of self-rating questionnaires and their accompanying question-by-question video recordings in this study. We offer an end-to-end system to handle the face video recording that is conditioned on the questionnaire answers and the responding time to automatically interpret sadness from the SDS assessment and the associated video. We modified a 3D-CNN for temporal feature extraction and compared various state-of-the-art temporal modeling techniques. The superior performance of our system shows the validity of combining facial video recording with the SDS score for more accurate self-diagnose.

- **Summary**: Assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to non-invasively evaluate detailed cardiac structure and function. Accurate segmentation of cardiac structures from cine MRI is a crucial step for early diagnosis and prognosis of CVD, and has been greatly improved with convolutional neural networks (CNN). There, however, are a number of limitations identified in CNN models, such as limited interpretability and high complexity, thus limiting their use in clinical practice. In this work, to address the limitations, we propose a lightweight and interpretable machine learning model, successive subspace learning with the subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab) transform, for accurate and efficient segmentation from cine MRI. Specifically, our segmentation framework is comprised of the following steps: (1) sequential expansion of near-to-far neighborhood at different resolutions; (2) channel-wise subspace approximation using the Saab transform for unsupervised dimension reduction; (3) class-wise entropy guided feature selection for supervised dimension reduction; (4) concatenation of features and pixel-wise classification with gradient boost; and (5) conditional random field for post-processing. Experimental results on the ACDC 2017 segmentation database, showed that our framework performed better than state-of-the-art U-Net models with 200$\times$ fewer parameters in delineating the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardium, thus showing its potential to be used in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Faces generated using generative adversarial networks (GANs) have reached unprecedented realism. These faces, also known as "Deep Fakes", appear as realistic photographs with very little pixel-level distortions. While some work has enabled the training of models that lead to the generation of specific properties of the subject, generating a facial image based on a natural language description has not been fully explored. For security and criminal identification, the ability to provide a GAN-based system that works like a sketch artist would be incredibly useful. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate facial images from semantic text descriptions. The learned model is provided with a text description and an outline of the type of face, which the model uses to sketch the features. Our models are trained using an Affine Combination Module (ACM) mechanism to combine the text embedding from BERT and the GAN latent space using a self-attention matrix. This avoids the loss of features due to inadequate "attention", which may happen if text embedding and latent vector are simply concatenated. Our approach is capable of generating images that are very accurately aligned to the exhaustive textual descriptions of faces with many fine detail features of the face and helps in generating better images. The proposed method is also capable of making incremental changes to a previously generated image if it is provided with additional textual descriptions or sentences.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network approaches to inverse imaging problems have produced impressive results in the last few years. In this paper, we consider the use of generative models in a variational regularisation approach to inverse problems. The considered regularisers penalise images that are far from the range of a generative model that has learned to produce images similar to a training dataset. We name this family \textit{generative regularisers}. The success of generative regularisers depends on the quality of the generative model and so we propose a set of desired criteria to assess generative models and guide future research. In our numerical experiments, we evaluate three common generative models, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, against our desired criteria. We also test three different generative regularisers on the inverse problems of deblurring, deconvolution, and tomography. We show that restricting solutions of the inverse problem to lie exactly in the range of a generative model can give good results but that allowing small deviations from the range of the generator produces more consistent results.

- **Summary**: Efficiently modeling spatial-temporal information in videos is crucial for action recognition. To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art methods typically employ the convolution operator and the dense interaction modules such as non-local blocks. However, these methods cannot accurately fit the diverse events in videos. On the one hand, the adopted convolutions are with fixed scales, thus struggling with events of various scales. On the other hand, the dense interaction modeling paradigm only achieves sub-optimal performance as action-irrelevant parts bring additional noises for the final prediction. In this paper, we propose a unified action recognition framework to investigate the dynamic nature of video content by introducing the following designs. First, when extracting local cues, we generate the spatial-temporal kernels of dynamic-scale to adaptively fit the diverse events. Second, to accurately aggregate these cues into a global video representation, we propose to mine the interactions only among a few selected foreground objects by a Transformer, which yields a sparse paradigm. We call the proposed framework as Event Adaptive Network (EAN) because both key designs are adaptive to the input video content. To exploit the short-term motions within local segments, we propose a novel and efficient Latent Motion Code (LMC) module, further improving the performance of the framework. Extensive experiments on several large-scale video datasets, e.g., Something-to-Something V1&V2, Kinetics, and Diving48, verify that our models achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performances at low FLOPs.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer diagnosed among men worldwide. The current PCa diagnostic pathway comes at the cost of substantial overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary treatment and further testing. Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) based on apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences has been proposed as a triage test to differentiate between clinically significant (cS) and non-clinically significant (ncS) prostate lesions. However, analysis of the sequences relies on expertise, requires specialized training, and suffers from inter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques hold promise in tasks such as classification and detection. Nevertheless, they rely on large amounts of annotated data which is not common in the medical field. In order to palliate such issues, existing works rely on transfer learning (TL) and ImageNet pre-training, which has been proven to be sub-optimal for the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we present a patch-based pre-training strategy to distinguish between cS and ncS lesions which exploit the region of interest (ROI) of the patched source domain to efficiently train a classifier in the full-slice target domain which does not require annotations by making use of transfer learning (TL). We provide a comprehensive comparison between several CNNs architectures and different settings which are presented as a baseline. Moreover, we explore cross-domain TL which exploits both MRI modalities and improves single modality results. Finally, we show how our approaches outperform the standard approaches by a considerable margin

- **Summary**: Though many attempts have been made in blind super-resolution to restore low-resolution images with unknown and complex degradations, they are still far from addressing general real-world degraded images. In this work, we extend the powerful ESRGAN to a practical restoration application (namely, Real-ESRGAN), which is trained with pure synthetic data. Specifically, a high-order degradation modeling process is introduced to better simulate complex real-world degradations. We also consider the common ringing and overshoot artifacts in the synthesis process. In addition, we employ a U-Net discriminator with spectral normalization to increase discriminator capability and stabilize the training dynamics. Extensive comparisons have shown its superior visual performance than prior works on various real datasets. We also provide efficient implementations to synthesize training pairs on the fly.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a simple and effective approach to solving the multi-label classification problem. The proposed approach leverages Transformer decoders to query the existence of a class label. The use of Transformer is rooted in the need of extracting local discriminative features adaptively for different labels, which is a strongly desired property due to the existence of multiple objects in one image. The built-in cross-attention module in the Transformer decoder offers an effective way to use label embeddings as queries to probe and pool class-related features from a feature map computed by a vision backbone for subsequent binary classifications. Compared with prior works, the new framework is simple, using standard Transformers and vision backbones, and effective, consistently outperforming all previous works on five multi-label classification data sets, including MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, and Visual Genome. Particularly, we establish $91.3\%$ mAP on MS-COCO. We hope its compact structure, simple implementation, and superior performance serve as a strong baseline for multi-label classification tasks and future studies.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a novel method for solving regression tasks using few-shot or weak supervision. At the core of our method is the fundamental observation that GANs are incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent space, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative frameworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which affect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been widely used in GAN-based image editing. We show that such directions are not only linear, but that the magnitude of change induced on the respective attribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along them. By leveraging this observation, our method turns a pre-trained GAN into a regression model, using as few as two labeled samples. This enables solving regression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce quality supervision for. Additionally, we show that the same latent-distances can be used to sort collections of images by the strength of given attributes, even in the absence of explicit supervision. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains, leverage multiple latent direction discovery frameworks, and achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when compared to methods designed to tackle a single task.

- **Summary**: Learning deformable 3D objects from 2D images is often an ill-posed problem. Existing methods rely on explicit supervision to establish multi-view correspondences, such as template shape models and keypoint annotations, which restricts their applicability on objects "in the wild". A more natural way of establishing correspondences is by watching videos of objects moving around. In this paper, we present DOVE, a method that learns textured 3D models of deformable object categories from monocular videos available online, without keypoint, viewpoint or template shape supervision. By resolving symmetry-induced pose ambiguities and leveraging temporal correspondences in videos, the model automatically learns to factor out 3D shape, articulated pose and texture from each individual RGB frame, and is ready for single-image inference at test time. In the experiments, we show that existing methods fail to learn sensible 3D shapes without additional keypoint or template supervision, whereas our method produces temporally consistent 3D models, which can be animated and rendered from arbitrary viewpoints.

- **Summary**: Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with small magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the certified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal improvement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that guarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary conditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness assumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the proposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble model can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model under mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the lightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust ensemble ML models. Extensive experiments show that our DRT enhanced ensembles can consistently achieve higher certified robustness than existing single and ensemble ML models, demonstrating the state-of-the-art certified L2-robustness on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets.

- **Summary**: Satellite remote imaging enables the detailed study of land use patterns on a global scale. We investigate the possibility to improve the information content of traditional land use classification by identifying the nature of industrial sites from medium-resolution remote sensing images. In this work, we focus on classifying different types of power plants from Sentinel-2 imaging data. Using a ResNet-50 deep learning model, we are able to achieve a mean accuracy of 90.0% in distinguishing 10 different power plant types and a background class. Furthermore, we are able to identify the cooling mechanisms utilized in thermal power plants with a mean accuracy of 87.5%. Our results enable us to qualitatively investigate the energy mix from Sentinel-2 imaging data, and prove the feasibility to classify industrial sites on a global scale from freely available satellite imagery.

- **Summary**: Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to revolutionize transportation and improve road safety significantly. However, these benefits do not come without cost; AVs require large Deep-Learning (DL) models and powerful hardware platforms to operate reliably in real-time, requiring between several hundred watts to one kilowatt of power. This power consumption can dramatically reduce vehicles' driving range and affect emissions. To address this problem, we propose SAGE: a methodology for selectively offloading the key energy-consuming modules of DL architectures to the cloud to optimize edge energy usage while meeting real-time latency constraints. Furthermore, we leverage Head Network Distillation (HND) to introduce efficient bottlenecks within the DL architecture in order to minimize the network overhead costs of offloading with almost no degradation in the model's performance. We evaluate SAGE using an Nvidia Jetson TX2 and an industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 as the AV edge devices and demonstrate that our offloading strategy is practical for a wide range of DL models and internet connection bandwidths on 3G, 4G LTE, and WiFi technologies. Compared to edge-only computation, SAGE reduces energy consumption by an average of 36.13%, 47.07%, and 55.66% for an AV with one low-resolution camera, one high-resolution camera, and three high-resolution cameras, respectively. SAGE also reduces upload data size by up to 98.40% compared to direct camera offloading.

- **Summary**: The 3D reconstruction of objects is a prerequisite for many highly relevant applications of computer vision such as mobile robotics or autonomous driving. To deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D objects from their 2D projections, a common strategy is to incorporate prior object knowledge into the reconstruction approach by establishing a 3D model and aligning it to the 2D image plane. However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape priors and the insufficiency of the derived image observations for a reliable alignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper is to show how 3D object reconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from a combined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images. We introduce a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a prediction of the vehicle type for a more appropriate regularisation of the vehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive predictions of the vehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior information for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints and wireframes, which are well-suited for model-to-image association and model fitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction is addressed by a versatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two challenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed shape prior can be shown. A comparison to state-of-the-art methods for vehicle pose estimation shows that the proposed approach performs on par or better, confirming the suitability of the developed shape prior and probabilistic model for vehicle reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a domain generalization (DG) approach to learn on several labeled source domains and transfer knowledge to a target domain that is inaccessible in training. Considering the inherent conditional and label shifts, we would expect the alignment of $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$. However, the widely used domain invariant feature learning (IFL) methods relies on aligning the marginal concept shift w.r.t. $p(x)$, which rests on an unrealistic assumption that $p(y)$ is invariant across domains. We thereby propose a novel variational Bayesian inference framework to enforce the conditional distribution alignment w.r.t. $p(x|y)$ via the prior distribution matching in a latent space, which also takes the marginal label shift w.r.t. $p(y)$ into consideration with the posterior alignment. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is robust to the label shift and the cross-domain accuracy is significantly improved, thereby achieving superior performance over the conventional IFL counterparts.

- **Summary**: In order to apply the recent successes of machine learning and automated plant phenotyping on a large scale using agricultural robotics, efficient and general algorithms must be designed to intelligently split crop fields into small, yet actionable, portions that can then be processed by more complex algorithms. In this paper, we notice a similarity between the current state-of-the-art for separating corn plants and a commonly used density-based clustering algorithm, Quickshift. Exploiting this similarity we propose a number of novel, application-specific algorithms with the goal of producing a general and scalable field segmentation algorithm. The novel algorithms proposed in this work are shown to produce quantitatively better results than the current state-of-the-art while being less sensitive to input parameters and maintaining the same algorithmic time complexity. When incorporated into field-scale phenotyping systems, the proposed algorithms should work as a drop-in replacement that can greatly improve the accuracy of results while ensuring that performance and scalability remain undiminished.

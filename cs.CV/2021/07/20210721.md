- **Summary**: Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Due to inconspicuous texture changes of liver tumor, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging is effective for the diagnosis of liver cancer. In this paper, we focus on improving automated liver tumor segmentation by integrating multi-modal CT images. To this end, we propose a novel mutual learning (ML) strategy for effective and robust multi-modal liver tumor segmentation. Different from existing multi-modal methods that fuse information from different modalities by a single model, with ML, an ensemble of modality-specific models learn collaboratively and teach each other to distill both the characteristics and the commonality between high-level representations of different modalities. The proposed ML not only enables the superiority for multi-modal learning but can also handle missing modalities by transferring knowledge from existing modalities to missing ones. Additionally, we present a modality-aware (MA) module, where the modality-specific models are interconnected and calibrated with attention weights for adaptive information exchange. The proposed modality-aware mutual learning (MAML) method achieves promising results for liver tumor segmentation on a large-scale clinical dataset. Moreover, we show the efficacy and robustness of MAML for handling missing modalities on both the liver tumor and public brain tumor (BRATS 2018) datasets.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models are notoriously data-hungry. Thus, there is an urging need for data-efficient techniques in medical image analysis, where well-annotated data are costly and time consuming to collect. Motivated by the recently revived "Copy-Paste" augmentation, we propose TumorCP, a simple but effective object-level data augmentation method tailored for tumor segmentation. TumorCP is online and stochastic, providing unlimited augmentation possibilities for tumors' subjects, locations, appearances, as well as morphologies. Experiments on kidney tumor segmentation task demonstrate that TumorCP surpasses the strong baseline by a remarkable margin of 7.12% on tumor Dice. Moreover, together with image-level data augmentation, it beats the current state-of-the-art by 2.32% on tumor Dice. Comprehensive ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of TumorCP. Meanwhile, we show that TumorCP can lead to striking improvements in extremely low-data regimes. Evaluated with only 10% labeled data, TumorCP significantly boosts tumor Dice by 21.87%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first work exploring and extending the "Copy-Paste" design in medical imaging domain. Code is available at: https://github.com/YaoZhang93/TumorCP.

- **Summary**: Developing video understanding intelligence is quite challenging because it requires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural language processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial attempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question answering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video question answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make progress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans understand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of understanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for VideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive Modules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules: targets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the understanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: "I understand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING." Each module has sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required aspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual questions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of VideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for validating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of the DramaQA dataset by applying CogME. The evaluation reveals that story elements are unevenly reflected in the existing dataset, and the model based on the dataset may cause biased predictions. Although this study has only been able to grasp a narrow range of stories, we expect that it offers the first step in considering the cognitive process of humans on the video understanding intelligence of humans and AI.

- **Summary**: In recent years, many semantic segmentation methods have been proposed to predict label of pixels in the scene. In general, we measure area prediction errors or boundary prediction errors for comparing methods. However, there is no intuitive evaluation metric that evaluates both aspects. In this work, we propose a new evaluation measure called weighted Intersection over Union (wIoU) for semantic segmentation. First, it build a weight map generated from a boundary distance map, allowing weighted evaluation for each pixel based on a boundary importance factor. The proposed wIoU can evaluate both contour and region by setting a boundary importance factor. We validated the effectiveness of wIoU on a dataset of 33 scenes and demonstrated its flexibility. Using the proposed metric, we expect more flexible and intuitive evaluation in semantic segmentation filed are possible.

- **Summary**: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have made an incredible progress in many Computer Vision tasks. This progress, however, often relies on the availability of large amounts of the training data, required to prevent over-fitting, which in many domains entails significant cost of manual data labeling. An alternative approach is application of data augmentation (DA) techniques that aim at model regularization by creating additional observations from the available ones. This survey focuses on two DA research streams: image mixing and automated selection of augmentation strategies. First, the presented methods are briefly described, and then qualitatively compared with respect to their key characteristics. Various quantitative comparisons are also included based on the results reported in recent DA literature. This review mainly covers the methods published in the materials of top-tier conferences and in leading journals in the years 2017-2021.

- **Summary**: Radiation exposure in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging limits its usage in the studies of radiation-sensitive populations, e.g., pregnant women, children, and adults that require longitudinal imaging. Reducing the PET radiotracer dose or acquisition time reduces photon counts, which can deteriorate image quality. Recent deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods for image-to-image translation enable the mapping of low-quality PET images (acquired using substantially reduced dose), coupled with the associated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However, such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new out-of-distribution (OOD) acquisitions. We propose a novel DNN formulation that models the (i) underlying sinogram-based physics of the PET imaging system and (ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity of the residuals between the predicted and the high-quality reference images. Our sinogram-based uncertainty-aware DNN framework, namely, suDNN, estimates a standard-dose PET image using multimodal input in the form of (i) a low-dose/low-count PET image and (ii) the corresponding multi-contrast MRI images, leading to improved robustness of suDNN to OOD acquisitions. Results on in vivo simultaneous PET-MRI, and various forms of OOD data in PET-MRI, show the benefits of suDNN over the current state of the art, quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Detecting 3D landmarks on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is crucial to assessing and quantifying the anatomical abnormalities in 3D cephalometric analysis. However, the current methods are time-consuming and suffer from large biases in landmark localization, leading to unreliable diagnosis results. In this work, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework (SA-LSTM) for efficient and accurate 3D landmark detection. To reduce the computational burden, SA-LSTM is designed in two stages. It first locates the coarse landmarks via heatmap regression on a down-sampled CBCT volume and then progressively refines landmarks by attentive offset regression using multi-resolution cropped patches. To boost accuracy, SA-LSTM captures global-local dependence among the cropping patches via self-attention. Specifically, a novel graph attention module implicitly encodes the landmark's global structure to rationalize the predicted position. Moreover, a novel attention-gated module recursively filters irrelevant local features and maintains high-confident local predictions for aggregating the final result. Experiments conducted on an in-house dataset and a public dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.64 mm and 2.37 mm average errors, respectively. Furthermore, our method is very efficient, taking only 0.5 seconds for inferring the whole CBCT volume of resolution 768$\times$768$\times$576.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection plays a key role in industrial manufacturing for product quality control. Traditional methods for anomaly detection are rule-based with limited generalization ability. Recent methods based on supervised deep learning are more powerful but require large-scale annotated datasets for training. In practice, abnormal products are rare thus it is very difficult to train a deep model in a fully supervised way. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on Self-organizing Map (SOM). Our method, Self-organizing Map for Anomaly Detection (SOMAD) maintains normal characteristics by using topological memory based on multi-scale features. SOMAD achieves state-of the-art performance on unsupervised anomaly detection and localization on the MVTec dataset.

- **Summary**: In multimodal tasks, we find that the importance of text and image modal information is different for different input cases, and for this motivation, we propose a high-performance and highly general Dual-Router Dynamic Framework (DRDF), consisting of Dual-Router, MWF-Layer, experts and expert fusion unit. The text router and image router in Dual-Router accept text modal information and image modal information, and use MWF-Layer to determine the importance of modal information. Based on the result of the determination, MWF-Layer generates fused weights for the fusion of experts. Experts are model backbones that match the current task. DRDF has high performance and high generality, and we have tested 12 backbones such as Visual BERT on multimodal dataset Hateful memes, unimodal dataset CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImagenet. Our DRDF outperforms all the baselines. We also verified the components of DRDF in detail by ablations, compared and discussed the reasons and ideas of DRDF design.

- **Summary**: Fusing medical images and the corresponding 3D shape representation can provide complementary information and microstructure details to improve the operational performance and accuracy in brain surgery. However, compared to the substantial image data, it is almost impossible to obtain the intraoperative 3D shape information by using physical methods such as sensor scanning, especially in minimally invasive surgery and robot-guided surgery. In this paper, a general generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture based on graph convolutional networks is proposed to reconstruct the 3D point clouds (PCs) of brains by using one single 2D image, thus relieving the limitation of acquiring 3D shape data during surgery. Specifically, a tree-structured generative mechanism is constructed to use the latent vector effectively and transfer features between hidden layers accurately. With the proposed generative model, a spontaneous image-to-PC conversion is finished in real-time. Competitive qualitative and quantitative experimental results have been achieved on our model. In multiple evaluation methods, the proposed model outperforms another common point cloud generative model PointOutNet.

- **Summary**: Multimodal neuroimage can provide complementary information about the dementia, but small size of complete multimodal data limits the ability in representation learning. Moreover, the data distribution inconsistency from different modalities may lead to ineffective fusion, which fails to sufficiently explore the intra-modal and inter-modal interactions and compromises the disease diagnosis performance. To solve these problems, we proposed a novel multimodal representation learning and adversarial hypergraph fusion (MRL-AHF) framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using complete trimodal images. First, adversarial strategy and pre-trained model are incorporated into the MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal data. Then two hypergraphs are constructed from the latent representations and the adversarial network based on graph convolution is employed to narrow the distribution difference of hyperedge features. Finally, the hyperedge-invariant features are fused for disease prediction by hyperedge convolution. Experiments on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on Alzheimer's disease detection compared with other related models and provides a possible way to understand the underlying mechanisms of disorder's progression by analyzing the abnormal brain connections.

- **Summary**: Using multimodal neuroimaging data to characterize brain network is currently an advanced technique for Alzheimer's disease(AD) Analysis. Over recent years the neuroimaging community has made tremendous progress in the study of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) derived from blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) derived from white matter fiber tractography. However, Due to the heterogeneity and complexity between BOLD signals and fiber tractography, Most existing multimodal data fusion algorithms can not sufficiently take advantage of the complementary information between rs-fMRI and DTI. To overcome this problem, a novel Hypergraph Generative Adversarial Networks(HGGAN) is proposed in this paper, which utilizes Interactive Hyperedge Neurons module (IHEN) and Optimal Hypergraph Homomorphism algorithm(OHGH) to generate multimodal connectivity of Brain Network from rs-fMRI combination with DTI. To evaluate the performance of this model, We use publicly available data from the ADNI database to demonstrate that the proposed model not only can identify discriminative brain regions of AD but also can effectively improve classification performance.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Networks, often owing to the overparameterization, are shown to be capable of exactly memorizing even randomly labelled data. Empirical studies have also shown that none of the standard regularization techniques mitigate such overfitting. We investigate whether the choice of the loss function can affect this memorization. We empirically show, with benchmark data sets MNIST and CIFAR-10, that a symmetric loss function, as opposed to either cross-entropy or squared error loss, results in significant improvement in the ability of the network to resist such overfitting. We then provide a formal definition for robustness to memorization and provide a theoretical explanation as to why the symmetric losses provide this robustness. Our results clearly bring out the role loss functions alone can play in this phenomenon of memorization.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method to generate fabrication blueprints from images of carpentered items. While 3D reconstruction from images is a well-studied problem, typical approaches produce representations that are ill-suited for computer-aided design and fabrication applications. Our key insight is that fabrication processes define and constrain the design space for carpentered objects, and can be leveraged to develop novel reconstruction methods. Our method makes use of domain-specific constraints to recover not just valid geometry, but a semantically valid assembly of parts, using a combination of image-based and geometric optimization techniques.   We demonstrate our method on a variety of wooden objects and furniture, and show that we can automatically obtain designs that are both easy to edit and accurate recreations of the ground truth. We further illustrate how our method can be used to fabricate a physical replica of the captured object as well as a customized version, which can be produced by directly editing the reconstructed model in CAD software.

- **Summary**: When recognizing emotions, subtle nuances in displays of emotion generate ambiguity or uncertainty in emotion perception. Emotion uncertainty has been previously interpreted as inter-rater disagreement among multiple annotators. In this paper, we consider a more common and challenging scenario: modeling emotion uncertainty when only single emotion labels are available. From a Bayesian perspective, we propose to use deep ensembles to capture uncertainty for multiple emotion descriptors, i.e., action units, discrete expression labels and continuous descriptors. We further apply iterative self-distillation. Iterative distillation over multiple generations significantly improves performance in both emotion recognition and uncertainty estimation. Our method generates single student models that provide accurate estimates of uncertainty for in-domain samples and a student ensemble that can detect out-of-domain samples. Our experiments on emotion recognition and uncertainty estimation using the Aff-wild2 dataset demonstrate that our algorithm gives more reliable uncertainty estimates than both Temperature Scaling and Monte Carol Dropout.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important medical imaging modality, but its acquisition speed is quite slow due to the physiological limitations. Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in accelerating MRI. In some circumstances, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution images even with prolonged scan time. Therefore, we proposed a novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images from low-resolution MR images by a factor of 2. We implemented our model on pelvic images from healthy subjects as training and validation data, while those data from patients were used for testing. The MR dataset was obtained using different imaging sequences, including T2, T2W SPAIR, and mDIXON-W. Four methods, i.e., BICUBIC, SRCNN, SRGAN, and EDSR were used for comparison. Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as compared to the other methods. In addition, the reconstructed high-resolution MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Due to its high spatial and spectral information content, hyperspectral imaging opens up new possibilities for a better understanding of data and scenes in a wide variety of applications. An essential part of this process of understanding is the classification part. In this article we present a general classification approach based on the shape of spectral signatures. In contrast to classical classification approaches (e.g. SVM, KNN), not only reflectance values are considered, but also parameters such as curvature points, curvature values, and the curvature behavior of spectral signatures are used to develop shape-describing rules in order to use them for classification by a rule-based procedure using IF-THEN queries. The flexibility and efficiency of the methodology is demonstrated using datasets from two different application fields and leads to convincing results with good performance.

- **Summary**: Deep Learning-based 2D/3D registration methods are highly robust but often lack the necessary registration accuracy for clinical application. A refinement step using the classical optimization-based 2D/3D registration method applied in combination with Deep Learning-based techniques can provide the required accuracy. However, it also increases the runtime. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning driven 2D/3D registration framework that can be used end-to-end for iterative registration tasks without relying on any further refinement step. We accomplish this by learning the update step of the 2D/3D registration framework using Point-to-Plane Correspondences. The update step is learned using iterative residual refinement-based optical flow estimation, in combination with the Point-to-Plane correspondence solver embedded as a known operator. Our proposed method achieves an average runtime of around 8s, a mean re-projection distance error of 0.60 $\pm$ 0.40 mm with a success ratio of 97 percent and a capture range of 60 mm. The combination of high registration accuracy, high robustness, and fast runtime makes our solution ideal for clinical applications.

- **Summary**: The parsing of windows in building facades is a long-desired but challenging task in computer vision. It is crucial to urban analysis, semantic reconstruction, lifecycle analysis, digital twins, and scene parsing amongst other building-related tasks that require high-quality semantic data. This article investigates the usage of the mask R-CNN framework to be used for window detection of facade imagery input. We utilize transfer learning to train our proposed method on COCO weights with our own collected dataset of street view images of facades to produce instance segmentations of our new window class. Experimental results show that our suggested approach with a relatively small dataset trains the network only with transfer learning and augmentation achieves results on par with prior state-of-the-art window detection approaches, even without post-optimization techniques.

- **Summary**: General object detectors use powerful backbones that uniformly extract features from images for enabling detection of a vast amount of object types. However, utilization of such backbones in object detection applications developed for specific object types can unnecessarily over-process an extensive amount of background. In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus redundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we introduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection architecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background and objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating objects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently merges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then dynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image proposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We demonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects are of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is required to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a factor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading pedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation. This method can be applied on other object detection applications in scenes with a considerable amount of background and variate object sizes to reduce computations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the task of one-shot sign spotting, i.e. given an example of an isolated sign (query), we want to identify whether/where this sign appears in a continuous, co-articulated sign language video (target). To achieve this goal, we propose a transformer-based network, called SignLookup. We employ 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatio-temporal representations from video clips. To solve the temporal scale discrepancies between the query and the target videos, we construct multiple queries from a single video clip using different frame-level strides. Self-attention is applied across these query clips to simulate a continuous scale space. We also utilize another self-attention module on the target video to learn the contextual within the sequence. Finally a mutual-attention is used to match the temporal scales to localize the query within the target sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only reliably identify isolated signs in continuous videos, regardless of the signers' appearance, but can also generalize to different sign languages. By taking advantage of the attention mechanism and the adaptive features, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the sign spotting task with accuracy as high as 96% on challenging benchmark datasets and significantly outperforming other approaches.

- **Summary**: Conditional generative models aim to learn the underlying joint distribution of data and labels to achieve conditional data generation. Among them, the auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN) has been widely used, but suffers from the problem of low intra-class diversity of the generated samples. The fundamental reason pointed out in this paper is that the classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, which therefore cannot provide informative guidance for the generator to approach the joint distribution, resulting in a minimization of the conditional entropy that decreases the intra-class diversity. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel conditional GAN with an auxiliary discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to resolve the above problem. Specifically, the proposed auxiliary discriminative classifier becomes generator-aware by recognizing the class-labels of the real data and the generated data discriminatively. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the generator can faithfully learn the joint distribution even without the original discriminator, making the proposed ADC-GAN robust to the value of the coefficient hyperparameter and the selection of the GAN loss, and stable during training. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of ADC-GAN in conditional generative modeling compared to state-of-the-art classifier-based and projection-based conditional GANs.

- **Summary**: Handwritten text recognition in low resource scenarios, such as manuscripts with rare alphabets, is a challenging problem. The main difficulty comes from the very few annotated data and the limited linguistic information (e.g. dictionaries and language models). Thus, we propose a few-shot learning-based handwriting recognition approach that significantly reduces the human labor annotation process, requiring only few images of each alphabet symbol. The method consists in detecting all the symbols of a given alphabet in a textline image and decoding the obtained similarity scores to the final sequence of transcribed symbols. Our model is first pretrained on synthetic line images generated from any alphabet, even though different from the target domain. A second training step is then applied to diminish the gap between the source and target data. Since this retraining would require annotation of thousands of handwritten symbols together with their bounding boxes, we propose to avoid such human effort through an unsupervised progressive learning approach that automatically assigns pseudo-labels to the non-annotated data. The evaluation on different manuscript datasets show that our model can lead to competitive results with a significant reduction in human effort. The code will be publicly available in this repository: \url{https://github.com/dali92002/HTRbyMatching}

- **Summary**: Despite video forecasting has been a widely explored topic in recent years, the mainstream of the existing work still limits their models with a single prediction space but completely neglects the way to leverage their model with multi-prediction spaces. This work fills this gap. For the first time, we deeply study numerous strategies to perform video forecasting in multi-prediction spaces and fuse their results together to boost performance. The prediction in the pixel space usually lacks the ability to preserve the semantic and structure content of the video however the prediction in the high-level feature space is prone to generate errors in the reduction and recovering process. Therefore, we build a recurrent connection between different feature spaces and incorporate their generations in the upsampling process. Rather surprisingly, this simple idea yields a much more significant performance boost than PhyDNet (performance improved by 32.1% MAE on MNIST-2 dataset, and 21.4% MAE on KTH dataset). Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on four datasets demonstrate the generalization ability and effectiveness of our approach. We show that our model significantly reduces the troublesome distortions and blurry artifacts and brings remarkable improvements to the accuracy in long term video prediction. The code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Advances in entity-graph based analysis of histopathology images have brought in a new paradigm to describe tissue composition, and learn the tissue structure-to-function relationship. Entity-graphs offer flexible and scalable representations to characterize tissue organization, while allowing the incorporation of prior pathological knowledge to further support model interpretability and explainability. However, entity-graph analysis requires prerequisites for image-to-graph translation and knowledge of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms applied to graph-structured data, which can potentially hinder their adoption. In this work, we aim to alleviate these issues by developing HistoCartography, a standardized python API with necessary preprocessing, machine learning and explainability tools to facilitate graph-analytics in computational pathology. Further, we have benchmarked the computational time and performance on multiple datasets across different imaging types and histopathology tasks to highlight the applicability of the API for building computational pathology workflows.

- **Summary**: Learning segmentation from noisy labels is an important task for medical image analysis due to the difficulty in acquiring highquality annotations. Most existing methods neglect the pixel correlation and structural prior in segmentation, often producing noisy predictions around object boundaries. To address this, we adopt a superpixel representation and develop a robust iterative learning strategy that combines noise-aware training of segmentation network and noisy label refinement, both guided by the superpixels. This design enables us to exploit the structural constraints in segmentation labels and effectively mitigate the impact of label noise in learning. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches, and achieves superior robustness in a wide range of label noises. Code is available at https://github.com/gaozhitong/SP_guided_Noisy_Label_Seg.

- **Summary**: Most modern approaches for domain adaptive semantic segmentation rely on continued access to source data during adaptation, which may be infeasible due to computational or privacy constraints. We focus on source-free domain adaptation for semantic segmentation, wherein a source model must adapt itself to a new target domain given only unlabeled target data. We propose Augmentation Consistency-guided Self-training (AUGCO), a source-free adaptation algorithm that uses the model's pixel-level predictive consistency across diverse, automatically generated views of each target image along with model confidence to identify reliable pixel predictions, and selectively self-trains on those. AUGCO achieves state-of-the-art results for source-free adaptation on 3 standard benchmarks for semantic segmentation, all within a simple to implement and fast to converge method.

- **Summary**: In a real-world scenario, human actions are typically out of the distribution from training data, which requires a model to both recognize the known actions and reject the unknown. Different from image data, video actions are more challenging to be recognized in an open-set setting due to the uncertain temporal dynamics and static bias of human actions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method to recognize actions in an open testing set. Specifically, we formulate the action recognition problem from the evidential deep learning (EDL) perspective and propose a novel model calibration method to regularize the EDL training. Besides, to mitigate the static bias of video representation, we propose a plug-and-play module to debias the learned representation through contrastive learning. Experimental results show that our DEAR method achieves consistent performance gain on multiple mainstream action recognition models and benchmarks. Code and pre-trained models are available at {\small{\url{https://www.rit.edu/actionlab/dear}}}.

- **Summary**: Meteorology satellite visible light images is critical for meteorology support and forecast. However, there is no such kind of data during night time. To overcome this, we propose a method based on deep learning to create synthetic satellite visible light images during night. Specifically, to produce more realistic products, we train a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate visible light images given the corresponding satellite infrared images and numerical weather prediction(NWP) products. To better model the nonlinear relationship from infrared data and NWP products to visible light images, we propose to use the channel-wise attention mechanics, e.g., SEBlock to quantitative weight the input channels. The experiments based on the ECMWF NWP products and FY-4A meteorology satellite visible light and infrared channels date show that the proposed methods can be effective to create realistic synthetic satellite visible light images during night.

- **Summary**: Automated image processing approaches are indispensable for many biomedical experiments and help to cope with the increasing amount of microscopy image data in a fast and reproducible way. Especially state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches most often require large amounts of annotated training data to produce accurate and generalist outputs, but they are often compromised by the general lack of those annotated data sets. In this work, we propose how conditional generative adversarial networks can be utilized to generate realistic image data for 3D fluorescence microscopy from annotation masks of 3D cellular structures. In combination with mask simulation approaches, we demonstrate the generation of fully-annotated 3D microscopy data sets that we make publicly available for training or benchmarking. An additional positional conditioning of the cellular structures enables the reconstruction of position-dependent intensity characteristics and allows to generate image data of different quality levels. A patch-wise working principle and a subsequent full-size reassemble strategy is used to generate image data of arbitrary size and different organisms. We present this as a proof-of-concept for the automated generation of fully-annotated training data sets requiring only a minimum of manual interaction to alleviate the need of manual annotations.

- **Summary**: Traffic accident anticipation aims to accurately and promptly predict the occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a safety-guaranteed self-driving system. To encourage an early and accurate decision, existing approaches typically focus on capturing the cues of spatial and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interaction with the environment. In this paper, we propose Deep ReInforced accident anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam observation environment so that the decision from the proposed stochastic multi-task agent can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense anticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the DRIVE model with our improved reinforcement learning algorithm. Experimental results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world traffic accident datasets.

- **Summary**: Quality assessment plays a key role in creating and comparing video compression algorithms. Despite the development of a large number of new methods for assessing quality, generally accepted and well-known codecs comparisons mainly use the classical methods like PSNR, SSIM and new method VMAF. These methods can be calculated following different rules: they can use different frame-by-frame averaging techniques or different summation of color components. In this paper, a fundamental comparison of various versions of generally accepted metrics is carried out to find the most relevant and recommended versions of video quality metrics to be used in codecs comparisons. For comparison, we used a set of videos encoded with video codecs of different standards, and visual quality scores collected for the resulting set of streams since 2018 until 2021

- **Summary**: This paper presents a simple MLP-like architecture, CycleMLP, which is a versatile backbone for visual recognition and dense predictions. As compared to modern MLP architectures, e.g., MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and gMLP, whose architectures are correlated to image size and thus are infeasible in object detection and segmentation, CycleMLP has two advantages compared to modern approaches. (1) It can cope with various image sizes. (2) It achieves linear computational complexity to image size by using local windows. In contrast, previous MLPs have $O(N^2)$ computations due to fully spatial connections. We build a family of models which surpass existing MLPs and even state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, e.g., Swin Transformer, while using fewer parameters and FLOPs. We expand the MLP-like models' applicability, making them a versatile backbone for dense prediction tasks. CycleMLP achieves competitive results on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. In particular, CycleMLP-Tiny outperforms Swin-Tiny by 1.3% mIoU on ADE20K dataset with fewer FLOPs. Moreover, CycleMLP also shows excellent zero-shot robustness on ImageNet-C dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a correspondence-free method for point cloud rotational registration. We learn an embedding for each point cloud in a feature space that preserves the SO(3)-equivariance property, enabled by recent developments in equivariant neural networks. The proposed shape registration method achieves three major advantages through combining equivariant feature learning with implicit shape models. First, the necessity of data association is removed because of the permutation-invariant property in network architectures similar to PointNet. Second, the registration in feature space can be solved in closed-form using Horn's method due to the SO(3)-equivariance property. Third, the registration is robust to noise in the point cloud because of the joint training of registration and implicit shape reconstruction. The experimental results show superior performance compared with existing correspondence-free deep registration methods.

- **Summary**: Forecasting the behavior of other agents is an integral part of the modern robotic autonomy stack, especially in safety-critical scenarios with human-robot interaction, such as autonomous driving. In turn, there has been a significant amount of interest and research in trajectory forecasting, resulting in a wide variety of approaches. Common to all works, however, is the use of the same few accuracy-based evaluation metrics, e.g., displacement error and log-likelihood. While these metrics are informative, they are task-agnostic and predictions that are evaluated as equal can lead to vastly different outcomes, e.g., in downstream planning and decision making. In this work, we take a step back and critically evaluate current trajectory forecasting metrics, proposing task-aware metrics as a better measure of performance in systems where prediction is being deployed. We additionally present one example of such a metric, incorporating planning-awareness within existing trajectory forecasting metrics.

- **Summary**: In this paper we presented mmPose-NLP, a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) inspired Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) skeletal key-point estimator using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar data. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first method to precisely estimate upto 25 skeletal key-points using mmWave radar data alone. Skeletal pose estimation is critical in several applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, patient monitoring, gait analysis, to defense security forensics, and aid both preventative and actionable decision making. The use of mmWave radars for this task, over traditionally employed optical sensors, provide several advantages, primarily its operational robustness to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions, where optical sensor performance degrade significantly. The mmWave radar point-cloud (PCL) data is first voxelized (analogous to tokenization in NLP) and $N$ frames of the voxelized radar data (analogous to a text paragraph in NLP) is subjected to the proposed mmPose-NLP architecture, where the voxel indices of the 25 skeletal key-points (analogous to keyword extraction in NLP) are predicted. The voxel indices are converted back to real world 3-D coordinates using the voxel dictionary used during the tokenization process. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the accuracy of the proposed system against the ground truth, with the proposed mmPose-NLP offering <3 cm localization errors in the depth, horizontal and vertical axes. The effect of the number of input frames vs performance/accuracy was also studied for N = {1,2,..,10}. A comprehensive methodology, results, discussions and limitations are presented in this paper. All the source codes and results are made available on GitHub for furthering research and development in this critical yet emerging domain of skeletal key-point estimation using mmWave radars.

- **Summary**: Background: In medical imaging, prior studies have demonstrated disparate AI performance by race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical imaging that would be obvious to the human expert interpreting the images.   Methods: Using private and public datasets we evaluate: A) performance quantification of deep learning models to detect race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalize to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities, B) assessment of possible confounding anatomic and phenotype population features, such as disease distribution and body habitus as predictors of race, and C) investigation into the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognize race.   Findings: Standard deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities. Our findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race, such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further study.   Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model has access to.

- **Summary**: The development of digitization methods for line drawings (especially in the area of electrical engineering) relies on the availability of publicly available training and evaluation data. This paper presents such an image set along with annotations. The dataset consists of 1152 images of 144 circuits by 12 drafters and 48 563 annotations. Each of these images depicts an electrical circuit diagram, taken by consumer grade cameras under varying lighting conditions and perspectives. A variety of different pencil types and surface materials has been used. For each image, all individual electrical components are annotated with bounding boxes and one out of 45 class labels. In order to simplify a graph extraction process, different helper symbols like junction points and crossovers are introduced, while texts are annotated as well. The geometric and taxonomic problems arising from this task as well as the classes themselves and statistics of their appearances are stated. The performance of a standard Faster RCNN on the dataset is provided as an object detection baseline.

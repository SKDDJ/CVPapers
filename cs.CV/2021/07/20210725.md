- **Summary**: Video captioning is one of the challenging problems at the intersection of vision and language, having many real-life applications in video retrieval, video surveillance, assisting visually challenged people, Human-machine interface, and many more. Recent deep learning based methods have shown promising results but are still on the lower side than other vision tasks (such as image classification, object detection). A significant drawback with existing video captioning methods is that they are optimized over cross-entropy loss function, which is uncorrelated to the de facto evaluation metrics (BLEU, METEOR, CIDER, ROUGE). In other words, cross-entropy is not a proper surrogate of the true loss function for video captioning. To mitigate this, methods like REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, and Minimum Risk Training (MRT) have been applied but have limitations and are not very effective. This paper proposes an alternate solution by introducing a dynamic loss network (DLN), providing an additional feedback signal that reflects the evaluation metrics directly. Our solution proves to be more efficient than other solutions and can be easily adapted to similar tasks. Our results on Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD) and MSR-Video to Text (MSRVTT) datasets outperform previous methods.

- **Summary**: How to effectively and efficiently deal with spatio-temporal event streams, where the events are generally sparse and non-uniform and have the microsecond temporal resolution, is of great value and has various real-life applications. Spiking neural network (SNN), as one of the brain-inspired event-triggered computing models, has the potential to extract effective spatio-temporal features from the event streams. However, when aggregating individual events into frames with a new higher temporal resolution, existing SNN models do not attach importance to that the serial frames have different signal-to-noise ratios since event streams are sparse and non-uniform. This situation interferes with the performance of existing SNNs. In this work, we propose a temporal-wise attention SNN (TA-SNN) model to learn frame-based representation for processing event streams. Concretely, we extend the attention concept to temporal-wise input to judge the significance of frames for the final decision at the training stage, and discard the irrelevant frames at the inference stage. We demonstrate that TA-SNN models improve the accuracy of event streams classification tasks. We also study the impact of multiple-scale temporal resolutions for frame-based representation. Our approach is tested on three different classification tasks: gesture recognition, image classification, and spoken digit recognition. We report the state-of-the-art results on these tasks, and get the essential improvement of accuracy (almost 19\%) for gesture recognition with only 60 ms.

- **Summary**: Despite the great success achieved by deep learning methods in face recognition, severe performance drops are observed for large pose variations in unconstrained environments (e.g., in cases of surveillance and photo-tagging). To address it, current methods either deploy pose-specific models or frontalize faces by additional modules. Still, they ignore the fact that identity information should be consistent across poses and are not realizing the data imbalance between frontal and profile face images during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient PoseFace framework which utilizes the facial landmarks to disentangle the pose-invariant features and exploits a pose-adaptive loss to handle the imbalance issue adaptively. Extensive experimental results on the benchmarks of Multi-PIE, CFP, CPLFW and IJB have demonstrated the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-arts.

- **Summary**: Uncertainties in machine learning are a significant roadblock for its application in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). One source of uncertainty arises from distribution shifts in the input data between training and test scenarios. Detecting such distribution shifts in real-time is an emerging approach to address the challenge. The high dimensional input space in CPS applications involving imaging adds extra difficulty to the task. Generative learning models are widely adopted for the task, namely out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. To improve the state-of-the-art, we studied existing proposals from both machine learning and CPS fields. In the latter, safety monitoring in real-time for autonomous driving agents has been a focus. Exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of motion in videos, we can robustly detect hazardous motion around autonomous driving agents. Inspired by the latest advances in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) theory and practice, we tapped into the prior knowledge in data to further boost OoD detection's robustness. Comparison studies over nuScenes and Synthia data sets show our methods significantly improve detection capabilities of OoD factors unique to driving scenarios, 42% better than state-of-the-art approaches. Our model also generalized near-perfectly, 97% better than the state-of-the-art across the real-world and simulation driving data sets experimented. Finally, we customized one proposed method into a twin-encoder model that can be deployed to resource limited embedded devices for real-time OoD detection. Its execution time was reduced over four times in low-precision 8-bit integer inference, while detection capability is comparable to its corresponding floating-point model.

- **Summary**: Given a video demonstration, can we imitate the action contained in this video? In this paper, we introduce a novel task, dubbed mesh-based action imitation. The goal of this task is to enable an arbitrary target human mesh to perform the same action shown on the video demonstration. To achieve this, a novel Mesh-based Video Action Imitation (M-VAI) method is proposed by us. M-VAI first learns to reconstruct the meshes from the given source image frames, then the initial recovered mesh sequence is fed into mesh2mesh, a mesh sequence smooth module proposed by us, to improve the temporal consistency. Finally, we imitate the actions by transferring the pose from the constructed human body to our target identity mesh. High-quality and detailed human body meshes can be generated by using our M-VAI. Extensive experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our task and the effectiveness of our proposed method.



### Semantic Attention and Scale Complementary Network for Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the challenging multicategory instance segmentation problem in remote sensing images (RSIs), which aims at predicting the categories of all instances and localizing them with pixel-level masks. Although many landmark frameworks have demonstrated promising performance in instance segmentation, the complexity in the background and scale variability instances still remain challenging for instance segmentation of RSIs. To address the above problems, we propose an end-to-end multi-category instance segmentation model, namely Semantic Attention and Scale Complementary Network, which mainly consists of a Semantic Attention (SEA) module and a Scale Complementary Mask Branch (SCMB). The SEA module contains a simple fully convolutional semantic segmentation branch with extra supervision to strengthen the activation of interest instances on the feature map and reduce the background noise's interference. To handle the under-segmentation of geospatial instances with large varying scales, we design the SCMB that extends the original single mask branch to trident mask branches and introduces complementary mask supervision at different scales to sufficiently leverage the multi-scale information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the iSAID dataset and the NWPU Instance Segmentation dataset and achieve promising performance.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of deep learning on supervised point cloud semantic segmentation, obtaining large-scale point-by-point manual annotations is still a significant challenge. To reduce the huge annotation burden, we propose a Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning (ReDAL), a general framework for many deep learning approaches, aiming to automatically select only informative and diverse sub-scene regions for label acquisition. Observing that only a small portion of annotated regions are sufficient for 3D scene understanding with deep learning, we use softmax entropy, color discontinuity, and structural complexity to measure the information of sub-scene regions. A diversity-aware selection algorithm is also developed to avoid redundant annotations resulting from selecting informative but similar regions in a querying batch. Extensive experiments show that our method highly outperforms previous active learning strategies, and we achieve the performance of 90% fully supervised learning, while less than 15% and 5% annotations are required on S3DIS and SemanticKITTI datasets, respectively. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tsunghan-wu/ReDAL.

- **Summary**: Frozen sectioning (FS) is the preparation method of choice for microscopic evaluation of tissues during surgical operations. The high speed of the procedure allows pathologists to rapidly assess the key microscopic features, such as tumour margins and malignant status to guide surgical decision-making and minimise disruptions to the course of the operation. However, FS is prone to introducing many misleading artificial structures (histological artefacts), such as nuclear ice crystals, compression, and cutting artefacts, hindering timely and accurate diagnostic judgement of the pathologist. Additional training and prolonged experience is often required to make highly effective and time-critical diagnosis on frozen sections. On the other hand, the gold standard tissue preparation technique of formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding (FFPE) provides significantly superior image quality, but is a very time-consuming process (12-48 hours), making it unsuitable for intra-operative use. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) method that improves FS image quality by computationally transforming frozen-sectioned whole-slide images (FS-WSIs) into whole-slide FFPE-style images in minutes. AI-FFPE rectifies FS artefacts with the guidance of an attention mechanism that puts a particular emphasis on artefacts while utilising a self-regularization mechanism established between FS input image and synthesized FFPE-style image that preserves clinically relevant features. As a result, AI-FFPE method successfully generates FFPE-style images without significantly extending tissue processing time and consequently improves diagnostic accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of AI-FFPE on lung and brain frozen sections using a variety of different qualitative and quantitative metrics including visual Turing tests from 20 board certified pathologists.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a challenging task in the absence of densely labelled data. Only relying on class activation maps (CAM) with image-level labels provides deficient segmentation supervision. Prior works thus consider pre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of pseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic generation process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency maps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel weakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage saliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level ground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also propose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency and segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used to refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved pseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating and cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity learning method. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation performance on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Due to the limited availability and high cost of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, many studies have proposed machine learning techniques for detecting COVID-19 from medical imaging. The purpose of this study is to systematically review, assess, and synthesize research articles that have used different machine learning techniques to detect and diagnose COVID-19 from chest X-ray and CT scan images. A structured literature search was conducted in the relevant bibliographic databases to ensure that the survey solely centered on reproducible and high-quality research. We selected papers based on our inclusion criteria. In this survey, we reviewed $98$ articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We have surveyed a complete pipeline of chest imaging analysis techniques related to COVID-19, including data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and visualization. We have considered CT scans and X-rays as both are widely used to describe the latest developments in medical imaging to detect COVID-19. This survey provides researchers with valuable insights into different machine learning techniques and their performance in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest imaging. At the end, the challenges and limitations in detecting COVID-19 using machine learning techniques and the future direction of research are discussed.

- **Summary**: This work presents a comparison of machine learning algorithms that are implemented to segment the characters of text presented as an image. The algorithms are designed to work on degraded documents with text that is not aligned in an organized fashion. The paper investigates the use of Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and an Encoder Network to perform the operation of character spotting. Character Spotting involves extracting potential characters from a stream of text by selecting regions bound by white space.

- **Summary**: Numerous scene text detection methods have been proposed in recent years. Most of them declare they have achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, the performance comparison is unfair, due to lots of inconsistent settings (e.g., training data, backbone network, multi-scale feature fusion, evaluation protocols, etc.). These various settings would dissemble the pros and cons of the proposed core techniques. In this paper, we carefully examine and analyze the inconsistent settings, and propose a unified framework for the bottom-up based scene text detection methods. Under the unified framework, we ensure the consistent settings for non-core modules, and mainly investigate the representations of describing arbitrary-shape scene texts, e.g., regressing points on text contours, clustering pixels with predicted auxiliary information, grouping connected components with learned linkages, etc. With the comprehensive investigations and elaborate analyses, it not only cleans up the obstacle of understanding the performance differences between existing methods but also reveals the advantages and disadvantages of previous models under fair comparisons.

- **Summary**: This paper is a presentation of a new method for denoising images using Haralick features and further segmenting the characters using artificial neural networks. The image is divided into kernels, each of which is converted to a GLCM (Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix) on which a Haralick Feature generation function is called, the result of which is an array with fourteen elements corresponding to fourteen features The Haralick values and the corresponding noise/text classification form a dictionary, which is then used to de-noise the image through kernel comparison. Segmentation is the process of extracting characters from a document and can be used when letters are separated by white space, which is an explicit boundary marker. Segmentation is the first step in many Natural Language Processing problems. This paper explores the process of segmentation using Neural Networks. While there have been numerous methods to segment characters of a document, this paper is only concerned with the accuracy of doing so using neural networks. It is imperative that the characters be segmented correctly, for failing to do so will lead to incorrect recognition by Natural language processing tools. Artificial Neural Networks was used to attain accuracy of upto 89%. This method is suitable for languages where the characters are delimited by white space. However, this method will fail to provide acceptable results when the language heavily uses connected letters. An example would be the Devanagari script, which is predominantly used in northern India.



### Efficient Large Scale Inlier Voting for Geometric Vision Problems

- **Summary**: Outlier rejection and equivalently inlier set optimization is a key ingredient in numerous applications in computer vision such as filtering point-matches in camera pose estimation or plane and normal estimation in point clouds. Several approaches exist, yet at large scale we face a combinatorial explosion of possible solutions and state-of-the-art methods like RANSAC, Hough transform or Branch&Bound require a minimum inlier ratio or prior knowledge to remain practical. In fact, for problems such as camera posing in very large scenes these approaches become useless as they have exponential runtime growth if these conditions aren't met. To approach the problem we present a efficient and general algorithm for outlier rejection based on "intersecting" $k$-dimensional surfaces in $R^d$. We provide a recipe for casting a variety of geometric problems as finding a point in $R^d$ which maximizes the number of nearby surfaces (and thus inliers). The resulting algorithm has linear worst-case complexity with a better runtime dependency in the approximation factor than competing algorithms while not requiring domain specific bounds. This is achieved by introducing a space decomposition scheme that bounds the number of computations by successively rounding and grouping samples. Our recipe (and open-source code) enables anybody to derive such fast approaches to new problems across a wide range of domains. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach on several camera posing problems with a high number of matches at low inlier ratio achieving state-of-the-art results at significantly lower processing times.

- **Summary**: How to model fine-grained spatial-temporal dynamics in videos has been a challenging problem for action recognition. It requires learning deep and rich features with superior distinctiveness for the subtle and abstract motions. Most existing methods generate features of a layer in a pure feedforward manner, where the information moves in one direction from inputs to outputs. And they rely on stacking more layers to obtain more powerful features, bringing extra non-negligible overheads. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Recursive Circle (ARC) framework, a fine-grained decorator for pure feedforward layers. It inherits the operators and parameters of the original layer but is slightly different in the use of those operators and parameters. Specifically, the input of the layer is treated as an evolving state, and its update is alternated with the feature generation. At each recursive step, the input state is enriched by the previously generated features and the feature generation is made with the newly updated input state. We hope the ARC framework can facilitate fine-grained action recognition by introducing deeply refined features and multi-scale receptive fields at a low cost. Significant improvements over feedforward baselines are observed on several benchmarks. For example, an ARC-equipped TSM-ResNet18 outperforms TSM-ResNet50 with 48% fewer FLOPs and 52% model parameters on Something-Something V1 and Diving48.

- **Summary**: More transformer blocks with residual connections have recently achieved impressive results on various tasks. To achieve better performance with fewer trainable parameters, recent methods are proposed to go shallower by parameter sharing or model compressing along with the depth. However, weak modeling capacity limits their performance. Contrastively, going wider by inducing more trainable matrixes and parameters would produce a huge model requiring advanced parallelism to train and inference.   In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient framework, going wider instead of deeper. Specially, following existing works, we adapt parameter sharing to compress along depth. But, such deployment would limit the performance. To maximize modeling capacity, we scale along model width by replacing feed-forward network (FFN) with mixture-of-experts (MoE). Across transformer blocks, instead of sharing normalization layers, we propose to use individual layernorms to transform various semantic representations in a more parameter-efficient way. To evaluate our plug-and-run framework, we design WideNet and conduct comprehensive experiments on popular computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, our best model outperforms Vision Transformer (ViT) by $1.5\%$ with $0.72 \times$ trainable parameters. Using $0.46 \times$ and $0.13 \times$ parameters, our WideNet can still surpass ViT and ViT-MoE by $0.8\%$ and $2.1\%$, respectively. On four natural language processing datasets, WideNet outperforms ALBERT by $1.8\%$ on average and surpass BERT using factorized embedding parameterization by $0.8\%$ with fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: Sign language is the only medium of communication for the hearing impaired and the deaf and dumb community. Communication with the general mass is thus always a challenge for this minority group. Especially in Bangla sign language (BdSL), there are 38 alphabets with some having nearly identical symbols. As a result, in BdSL recognition, the posture of hand is an important factor in addition to visual features extracted from traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, a novel architecture "Concatenated BdSL Network" is proposed which consists of a CNN based image network and a pose estimation network. While the image network gets the visual features, the relative positions of hand keypoints are taken by the pose estimation network to obtain the additional features to deal with the complexity of the BdSL symbols. A score of 91.51% was achieved by this novel approach in test set and the effectiveness of the additional pose estimation network is suggested by the experimental results.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based models are developed to automatically detect if a retina image is `referable' in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. However, their classification accuracy degrades as the input images distributionally shift from their training distribution. Further, even if the input is not a retina image, a standard DR classifier produces a high confident prediction that the image is `referable'. Our paper presents a Dirichlet Prior Network-based framework to address this issue. It utilizes an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector model and a DR classification model to improve generalizability by identifying OOD images. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that the proposed framework can eliminate the unknown non-retina images and identify the distributionally shifted retina images for human intervention.

- **Summary**: With the advent of internet, not safe for work(NSFW) content moderation is a major problem today. Since,smartphones are now part of daily life of billions of people,it becomes even more important to have a solution which coulddetect and suggest user about potential NSFW content present ontheir phone. In this paper we present a novel on-device solutionfor detecting NSFW images. In addition to conventional porno-graphic content moderation, we have also included semi-nudecontent moderation as it is still NSFW in a large demography.We have curated a dataset comprising of three major categories,namely nude, semi-nude and safe images. We have created anensemble of object detector and classifier for filtering of nudeand semi-nude contents. The solution provides unsafe body partannotations along with identification of semi-nude images. Weextensively tested our proposed solution on several public datasetand also on our custom dataset. The model achieves F1 scoreof 0.91 with 95% precision and 88% recall on our customNSFW16k dataset and 0.92 MAP on NPDI dataset. Moreover itachieves average 0.002 false positive rate on a collection of safeimage open datasets.

- **Summary**: Among numerous videos shared on the web, well-edited ones always attract more attention. However, it is difficult for inexperienced users to make well-edited videos because it requires professional expertise and immense manual labor. To meet the demands for non-experts, we present Transcript-to-Video -- a weakly-supervised framework that uses texts as input to automatically create video sequences from an extensive collection of shots. Specifically, we propose a Content Retrieval Module and a Temporal Coherent Module to learn visual-language representations and model shot sequencing styles, respectively. For fast inference, we introduce an efficient search strategy for real-time video clip sequencing. Quantitative results and user studies demonstrate empirically that the proposed learning framework can retrieve content-relevant shots while creating plausible video sequences in terms of style. Besides, the run-time performance analysis shows that our framework can support real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Most few-shot learning models utilize only one modality of data. We would like to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively how much will the model improve if we add an extra modality (i.e. text description of the image), and how it affects the learning procedure. To achieve this goal, we propose four types of fusion method to combine the image feature and text feature. To verify the effectiveness of improvement, we test the fusion methods with two classical few-shot learning models - ProtoNet and MAML, with image feature extractors such as ConvNet and ResNet12. The attention-based fusion method works best, which improves the classification accuracy by a large margin around 30% comparing to the baseline result.

- **Summary**: Attention is an important component of modern deep learning. However, less emphasis has been put on its inverse: ignoring distraction. Our daily lives require us to explicitly avoid giving attention to salient visual features that confound the task we are trying to accomplish. This visual prioritisation allows us to concentrate on important tasks while ignoring visual distractors.   In this work, we introduce Neural Blindness, which gives an agent the ability to completely ignore objects or classes that are deemed distractors. More explicitly, we aim to render a neural network completely incapable of representing specific chosen classes in its latent space. In a very real sense, this makes the network "blind" to certain classes, allowing and agent to focus on what is important for a given task, and demonstrates how this can be used to improve localisation.



### Spatio-Temporal Representation Factorization for Video-based Person Re-Identification

- **Summary**: Despite much recent progress in video-based person re-identification (re-ID), the current state-of-the-art still suffers from common real-world challenges such as appearance similarity among various people, occlusions, and frame misalignment. To alleviate these problems, we propose Spatio-Temporal Representation Factorization (STRF), a flexible new computational unit that can be used in conjunction with most existing 3D convolutional neural network architectures for re-ID. The key innovations of STRF over prior work include explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial features, with each component further factorized to capture complementary person-specific appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal factorization comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the color of clothes) that do not change much over time, and dynamic features (e.g., walking patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization also comprises two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as local (finer segments) appearance features, with the local features particularly useful in cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two factorization operations taken together result in a modular architecture for our parameter-wise light STRF unit that can be plugged in between any two 3D convolutional layers, resulting in an end-to-end learning framework. We empirically show that STRF improves performance of various existing baseline architectures while demonstrating new state-of-the-art results using standard person re-ID evaluation protocols on three benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Data from multi-modality provide complementary information in clinical prediction, but missing data in clinical cohorts limits the number of subjects in multi-modal learning context. Multi-modal missing imputation is challenging with existing methods when 1) the missing data span across heterogeneous modalities (e.g., image vs. non-image); or 2) one modality is largely missing. In this paper, we address imputation of missing data by modeling the joint distribution of multi-modal data. Motivated by partial bidirectional generative adversarial net (PBiGAN), we propose a new Conditional PBiGAN (C-PBiGAN) method that imputes one modality combining the conditional knowledge from another modality. Specifically, C-PBiGAN introduces a conditional latent space in a missing imputation framework that jointly encodes the available multi-modal data, along with a class regularization loss on imputed data to recover discriminative information. To our knowledge, it is the first generative adversarial model that addresses multi-modal missing imputation by modeling the joint distribution of image and non-image data. We validate our model with both the national lung screening trial (NLST) dataset and an external clinical validation cohort. The proposed C-PBiGAN achieves significant improvements in lung cancer risk estimation compared with representative imputation methods (e.g., AUC values increase in both NLST (+2.9\%) and in-house dataset (+4.3\%) compared with PBiGAN, p$<$0.05).

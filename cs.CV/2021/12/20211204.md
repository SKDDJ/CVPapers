- **Summary**: Advances in LiDAR sensors provide rich 3D data that supports 3D scene understanding. However, due to occlusion and signal miss, LiDAR point clouds are in practice 2.5D as they cover only partial underlying shapes, which poses a fundamental challenge to 3D perception. To tackle the challenge, we present a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model, dubbed Behind the Curtain Detector (BtcDet), which learns the object shape priors and estimates the complete object shapes that are partially occluded (curtained) in point clouds. BtcDet first identifies the regions that are affected by occlusion and signal miss. In these regions, our model predicts the probability of occupancy that indicates if a region contains object shapes. Integrated with this probability map, BtcDet can generate high-quality 3D proposals. Finally, the probability of occupancy is also integrated into a proposal refinement module to generate the final bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BtcDet. Particularly, for the 3D detection of both cars and cyclists on the KITTI benchmark, BtcDet surpasses all of the published state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins. Code is released (https://github.com/Xharlie/BtcDet}{https://github.com/Xharlie/BtcDet).

- **Summary**: Speech-driven 3D facial animation with accurate lip synchronization has been widely studied. However, synthesizing realistic motions for the entire face during speech has rarely been explored. In this work, we present a joint audio-text model to capture the contextual information for expressive speech-driven 3D facial animation. The existing datasets are collected to cover as many different phonemes as possible instead of sentences, thus limiting the capability of the audio-based model to learn more diverse contexts. To address this, we propose to leverage the contextual text embeddings extracted from the powerful pre-trained language model that has learned rich contextual representations from large-scale text data. Our hypothesis is that the text features can disambiguate the variations in upper face expressions, which are not strongly correlated with the audio. In contrast to prior approaches which learn phoneme-level features from the text, we investigate the high-level contextual text features for speech-driven 3D facial animation. We show that the combined acoustic and textual modalities can synthesize realistic facial expressions while maintaining audio-lip synchronization. We conduct the quantitative and qualitative evaluations as well as the perceptual user study. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model against existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: GANs have matured in recent years and are able to generate high-resolution, realistic images. However, the computational resources and the data required for the training of high-quality GANs are enormous, and the study of transfer learning of these models is therefore an urgent topic. Many of the available high-quality pretrained GANs are unconditional (like StyleGAN). For many applications, however, conditional GANs are preferable, because they provide more control over the generation process, despite often suffering more training difficulties. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on transferring from high-quality pretrained unconditional GANs to conditional GANs. This requires architectural adaptation of the pretrained GAN to perform the conditioning. To this end, we propose hyper-modulated generative networks that allow for shared and complementary supervision. To prevent the additional weights of the hypernetwork to overfit, with subsequent mode collapse on small target domains, we introduce a self-initialization procedure that does not require any real data to initialize the hypernetwork parameters. To further improve the sample efficiency of the transfer, we apply contrastive learning in the discriminator, which effectively works on very limited batch sizes. In extensive experiments, we validate the efficiency of the hypernetworks, self-initialization and contrastive loss for knowledge transfer on standard benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Automatic detection of weapons is significant for improving security and well being of individuals, nonetheless, it is a difficult task due to large variety of size, shape and appearance of weapons. View point variations and occlusion also are reasons which makes this task more difficult. Further, the current object detection algorithms process rectangular areas, however a slender and long rifle may really cover just a little portion of area and the rest may contain unessential details. To overcome these problem, we propose a CNN architecture for Orientation Aware Weapons Detection, which provides oriented bounding box with improved weapons detection performance. The proposed model provides orientation not only using angle as classification problem by dividing angle into eight classes but also angle as regression problem. For training our model for weapon detection a new dataset comprising of total 6400 weapons images is gathered from the web and then manually annotated with position oriented bounding boxes. Our dataset provides not only oriented bounding box as ground truth but also horizontal bounding box. We also provide our dataset in multiple formats of modern object detectors for further research in this area. The proposed model is evaluated on this dataset, and the comparative analysis with off-the shelf object detectors yields superior performance of proposed model, measured with standard evaluation strategies. The dataset and the model implementation are made publicly available at this link: https://bit.ly/2TyZICF.

- **Summary**: Objectives: To develop and validate a deep learning (DL)-based primary tumor biopsy signature for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis preoperatively in early breast cancer (EBC) patients with clinically negative ALN.   Methods: A total of 1,058 EBC patients with pathologically confirmed ALN status were enrolled from May 2010 to August 2020. A DL core-needle biopsy (DL-CNB) model was built on the attention-based multiple instance-learning (AMIL) framework to predict ALN status utilizing the DL features, which were extracted from the cancer areas of digitized whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast CNB specimens annotated by two pathologists. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were analyzed to evaluate our model.   Results: The best-performing DL-CNB model with VGG16_BN as the feature extractor achieved an AUC of 0.816 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.758, 0.865) in predicting positive ALN metastasis in the independent test cohort. Furthermore, our model incorporating the clinical data, which was called DL-CNB+C, yielded the best accuracy of 0.831 (95%CI: 0.775, 0.878), especially for patients younger than 50 years (AUC: 0.918, 95%CI: 0.825, 0.971). The interpretation of DL-CNB model showed that the top signatures most predictive of ALN metastasis were characterized by the nucleus features including density ($p$ = 0.015), circumference ($p$ = 0.009), circularity ($p$ = 0.010), and orientation ($p$ = 0.012).   Conclusion: Our study provides a novel DL-based biomarker on primary tumor CNB slides to predict the metastatic status of ALN preoperatively for patients with EBC.

- **Summary**: Deep hashing has shown promising performance in large-scale image retrieval. However, latent codes extracted by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) will inevitably lose semantic information during the binarization process, which damages the retrieval accuracy and makes it challenging. Although many existing approaches perform regularization to alleviate quantization errors, we figure out an incompatible conflict between metric learning and quantization learning. The metric loss penalizes the inter-class distances to push different classes unconstrained far away. Worse still, it tends to map the latent code deviate from ideal binarization point and generate severe ambiguity in the binarization process. Based on the minimum distance of the binary linear code, we creatively propose Hashing-guided Hinge Function (HHF) to avoid such conflict. In detail, the carefully-designed inflection point, which relies on the hash bit length and category numbers, is explicitly adopted to balance the metric term and quantization term. Such a modification prevents the network from falling into local metric optimal minima in deep hashing. Extensive experiments in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO show that HHF consistently outperforms existing techniques, and is robust and flexible to transplant into other methods.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have shown that StyleGANs provide promising prior models for downstream tasks on image synthesis and editing. However, since the latent codes of StyleGANs are designed to control global styles, it is hard to achieve a fine-grained control over synthesized images. We present SemanticStyleGAN, where a generator is trained to model local semantic parts separately and synthesizes images in a compositional way. The structure and texture of different local parts are controlled by corresponding latent codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model provides a strong disentanglement between different spatial areas. When combined with editing methods designed for StyleGANs, it can achieve a more fine-grained control to edit synthesized or real images. The model can also be extended to other domains via transfer learning. Thus, as a generic prior model with built-in disentanglement, it could facilitate the development of GAN-based applications and enable more potential downstream tasks.



### A Triple-Double Convolutional Neural Network for Panchromatic Sharpening

- **Summary**: Pansharpening refers to the fusion of a panchromatic image with a high spatial resolution and a multispectral image with a low spatial resolution, aiming to obtain a high spatial resolution multispectral image. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture with level-domain based loss function for pansharpening by taking into account the following double-type structures, \emph{i.e.,} double-level, double-branch, and double-direction, called as triple-double network (TDNet). By using the structure of TDNet, the spatial details of the panchromatic image can be fully exploited and utilized to progressively inject into the low spatial resolution multispectral image, thus yielding the high spatial resolution output. The specific network design is motivated by the physical formula of the traditional multi-resolution analysis (MRA) methods. Hence, an effective MRA fusion module is also integrated into the TDNet. Besides, we adopt a few ResNet blocks and some multi-scale convolution kernels to deepen and widen the network to effectively enhance the feature extraction and the robustness of the proposed TDNet. Extensive experiments on reduced- and full-resolution datasets acquired by WorldView-3, QuickBird, and GaoFen-2 sensors demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TDNet compared with some recent state-of-the-art pansharpening approaches. An ablation study has also corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) are generative models for face shape and appearance. However, the shape parameters of traditional 3DMMs satisfy the multivariate Gaussian distribution while the identity embeddings satisfy the hypersphere distribution, and this conflict makes it challenging for face reconstruction models to preserve the faithfulness and the shape consistency simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose the Sphere Face Model(SFM), a novel 3DMM for monocular face reconstruction, which can preserve both shape fidelity and identity consistency. The core of our SFM is the basis matrix which can be used to reconstruct 3D face shapes, and the basic matrix is learned by adopting a two-stage training approach where 3D and 2D training data are used in the first and second stages, respectively. To resolve the distribution mismatch, we design a novel loss to make the shape parameters have a hyperspherical latent space. Extensive experiments show that SFM has high representation ability and shape parameter space's clustering performance. Moreover, it produces fidelity face shapes, and the shapes are consistent in challenging conditions in monocular face reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation is a fundamental vision-language task that aims to segment out an object referred to by a natural language expression from an image. One of the key challenges behind this task is leveraging the referring expression for highlighting relevant positions in the image. A paradigm for tackling this problem is to leverage a powerful vision-language ("cross-modal") decoder to fuse features independently extracted from a vision encoder and a language encoder. Recent methods have made remarkable advancements in this paradigm by exploiting Transformers as cross-modal decoders, concurrent to the Transformer's overwhelming success in many other vision-language tasks. Adopting a different approach in this work, we show that significantly better cross-modal alignments can be achieved through the early fusion of linguistic and visual features in intermediate layers of a vision Transformer encoder network. By conducting cross-modal feature fusion in the visual feature encoding stage, we can leverage the well-proven correlation modeling power of a Transformer encoder for excavating helpful multi-modal context. This way, accurate segmentation results are readily harvested with a light-weight mask predictor. Without bells and whistles, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art methods on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref by large margins.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration is able to achieve fast and accurate alignment between a pair of images and thus plays an important role in many medical image studies. The current deep learning (DL)-based image registration approaches directly learn the spatial transformation from one image to another by leveraging a convolutional neural network, requiring ground truth or similarity metric. Nevertheless, these methods only use a global similarity energy function to evaluate the similarity of a pair of images, which ignores the similarity of regions of interest (ROIs) within images. Moreover, DL-based methods often estimate global spatial transformations of image directly, which never pays attention to region spatial transformations of ROIs within images. In this paper, we present a novel dual-flow transformation network with region consistency constraint which maximizes the similarity of ROIs within a pair of images and estimates both global and region spatial transformations simultaneously. Experiments on four public 3D MRI datasets show that the proposed method achieves the best registration performance in accuracy and generalization compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: <<<This is a pre-acceptance version, please, go through Pattern Recognition Journal on Sciencedirect to read the final version>>>. Edge detection is the basis of many computer vision applications. State of the art predominantly relies on deep learning with two decisive factors: dataset content and network's architecture. Most of the publicly available datasets are not curated for edge detection tasks. Here, we offer a solution to this constraint. First, we argue that edges, contours and boundaries, despite their overlaps, are three distinct visual features requiring separate benchmark datasets. To this end, we present a new dataset of edges. Second, we propose a novel architecture, termed Dense Extreme Inception Network for Edge Detection (DexiNed), that can be trained from scratch without any pre-trained weights. DexiNed outperforms other algorithms in the presented dataset. It also generalizes well to other datasets without any fine-tuning. The higher quality of DexiNed is also perceptually evident thanks to the sharper and finer edges it outputs.

- **Summary**: Multimodal fusion and multitask learning are two vital topics in machine learning. Despite the fruitful progress, existing methods for both problems are still brittle to the same challenge -- it remains dilemmatic to integrate the common information across modalities (resp. tasks) meanwhile preserving the specific patterns of each modality (resp. task). Besides, while they are actually closely related to each other, multimodal fusion and multitask learning are rarely explored within the same methodological framework before. In this paper, we propose Channel-Exchanging-Network (CEN) which is self-adaptive, parameter-free, and more importantly, applicable for multimodal and multitask dense image prediction. At its core, CEN adaptively exchanges channels between subnetworks of different modalities. Specifically, the channel exchanging process is self-guided by individual channel importance that is measured by the magnitude of Batch-Normalization (BN) scaling factor during training. For the application of dense image prediction, the validity of CEN is tested by four different scenarios: multimodal fusion, cycle multimodal fusion, multitask learning, and multimodal multitask learning. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation via RGB-D data and image translation through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of CEN compared to state-of-the-art methods. Detailed ablation studies have also been carried out, which demonstrate the advantage of each component we propose. Our code is available at https://github.com/yikaiw/CEN.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a robust sample generation scheme to construct informative triplets. The proposed hard sample generation is a two-stage synthesis framework that produces hard samples through effective positive and negative sample generators in two stages, respectively. The first stage stretches the anchor-positive pairs with piecewise linear manipulation and enhances the quality of generated samples by skillfully designing a conditional generative adversarial network to lower the risk of mode collapse. The second stage utilizes an adaptive reverse metric constraint to generate the final hard samples. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves superior performance than the existing hard-sample generation algorithms. Besides, we also find that our proposed hard sample generation method combining the existing triplet mining strategies can further boost the deep metric learning performance.

Our network improves the recognition accuracy by extracting more features that benefit recognition from SR images. In the experiment, we build three datasets using three different super-resolution algorithm, and our network increases the recognition accuracy by more than 6% comparing with ReaNet50 and DenseNet121.

- **Summary**: Thermal infrared (TIR) image has proven effectiveness in providing temperature cues to the RGB features for multispectral pedestrian detection. Most existing methods directly inject the TIR modality into the RGB-based framework or simply ensemble the results of two modalities. This, however, could lead to inferior detection performance, as the RGB and TIR features generally have modality-specific noise, which might worsen the features along with the propagation of the network. Therefore, this work proposes an effective and efficient cross-modality fusion module called Bi-directional Adaptive Attention Gate (BAA-Gate). Based on the attention mechanism, the BAA-Gate is devised to distill the informative features and recalibrate the representations asymptotically. Concretely, a bi-direction multi-stage fusion strategy is adopted to progressively optimize features of two modalities and retain their specificity during the propagation. Moreover, an adaptive interaction of BAA-Gate is introduced by the illumination-based weighting strategy to adaptively adjust the recalibrating and aggregating strength in the BAA-Gate and enhance the robustness towards illumination changes. Considerable experiments on the challenging KAIST dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method with satisfactory speed.

- **Summary**: While Transformer has achieved remarkable performance in various high-level vision tasks, it is still challenging to exploit the full potential of Transformer in image restoration. The crux lies in the limited depth of applying Transformer in the typical encoder-decoder framework for image restoration, resulting from heavy self-attention computation load and inefficient communications across different depth (scales) of layers. In this paper, we present a deep and effective Transformer-based network for image restoration, termed as U2-Former, which is able to employ Transformer as the core operation to perform image restoration in a deep encoding and decoding space. Specifically, it leverages the nested U-shaped structure to facilitate the interactions across different layers with different scales of feature maps. Furthermore, we optimize the computational efficiency for the basic Transformer block by introducing a feature-filtering mechanism to compress the token representation. Apart from the typical supervision ways for image restoration, our U2-Former also performs contrastive learning in multiple aspects to further decouple the noise component from the background image. Extensive experiments on various image restoration tasks, including reflection removal, rain streak removal and dehazing respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed U2-Former.

- **Summary**: Learning visual concepts from raw images without strong supervision is a challenging task. In this work, we show the advantages of prototype representations for understanding and revising the latent space of neural concept learners. For this purpose, we introduce interactive Concept Swapping Networks (iCSNs), a novel framework for learning concept-grounded representations via weak supervision and implicit prototype representations. iCSNs learn to bind conceptual information to specific prototype slots by swapping the latent representations of paired images. This semantically grounded and discrete latent space facilitates human understanding and human-machine interaction. We support this claim by conducting experiments on our novel data set "Elementary Concept Reasoning" (ECR), focusing on visual concepts shared by geometric objects.

- **Summary**: Multi-exposure fusion (MEF) is a technique for combining different images of the same scene acquired with different exposure settings into a single image. All the proposed MEF algorithms combine the set of images, somehow choosing from each one the part with better exposure.   We propose a novel multi-exposure image fusion chain taking into account noise removal. The novel method takes advantage of DCT processing and the multi-image nature of the MEF problem. We propose a joint fusion and denoising strategy taking advantage of spatio-temporal patch selection and collaborative 3D thresholding. The overall strategy permits to denoise and fuse the set of images without the need of recovering each denoised exposure image, leading to a very efficient procedure.

- **Summary**: The ability to generalize learned representations across significantly different visual domains, such as between real photos, clipart, paintings, and sketches, is a fundamental capacity of the human visual system. In this paper, different from most cross-domain works that utilize some (or full) source domain supervision, we approach a relatively new and very practical Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) setup of having no training supervision in neither source nor target domains. Our approach is based on self-supervised learning of a Bridge Across Domains (BrAD) - an auxiliary bridge domain accompanied by a set of semantics preserving visual (image-to-image) mappings to BrAD from each of the training domains. The BrAD and mappings to it are learned jointly (end-to-end) with a contrastive self-supervised representation model that semantically aligns each of the domains to its BrAD-projection, and hence implicitly drives all the domains (seen or unseen) to semantically align to each other. In this work, we show how using an edge-regularized BrAD our approach achieves significant gains across multiple benchmarks and a range of tasks, including UDG, Few-shot UDA, and unsupervised generalization across multi-domain datasets (including generalization to unseen domains and classes).

- **Summary**: Using a collection of publicly available links to short form video clips of an average of 6 seconds duration each, 1,275 users manually annotated each video multiple times to indicate both long-term and short-term memorability of the videos. The annotations were gathered as part of an online memory game and measured a participant's ability to recall having seen the video previously when shown a collection of videos. The recognition tasks were performed on videos seen within the previous few minutes for short-term memorability and within the previous 24 to 72 hours for long-term memorability. Data includes the reaction times for each recognition of each video. Associated with each video are text descriptions (captions) as well as a collection of image-level features applied to 3 frames extracted from each video (start, middle and end). Video-level features are also provided. The dataset was used in the Video Memorability task as part of the MediaEval benchmark in 2020.

- **Summary**: The majority of prior monocular depth estimation methods without groundtruth depth guidance focus on driving scenarios. We show that such methods generalize poorly to unseen complex indoor scenes, where objects are cluttered and arbitrarily arranged in the near field. To obtain more robustness, we propose a structure distillation approach to learn knacks from an off-the-shelf relative depth estimator that produces structured but metric-agnostic depth. By combining structure distillation with a branch that learns metrics from left-right consistency, we attain structured and metric depth for generic indoor scenes and make inferences in real-time. To facilitate learning and evaluation, we collect SimSIN, a dataset from simulation with thousands of environments, and UniSIN, a dataset that contains about 500 real scan sequences of generic indoor environments. We experiment in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings, and show improvements, as well as in downstream applications using our depth maps. This work provides a full study, covering methods, data, and applications aspects.

- **Summary**: We propose a parametric model that maps free-view images into a vector space of coded facial shape, expression and appearance with a neural radiance field, namely Morphable Facial NeRF. Specifically, MoFaNeRF takes the coded facial shape, expression and appearance along with space coordinate and view direction as input to an MLP, and outputs the radiance of the space point for photo-realistic image synthesis. Compared with conventional 3D morphable models (3DMM), MoFaNeRF shows superiority in directly synthesizing photo-realistic facial details even for eyes, mouths, and beards. Also, continuous face morphing can be easily achieved by interpolating the input shape, expression and appearance codes. By introducing identity-specific modulation and texture encoder, our model synthesizes accurate photometric details and shows strong representation ability. Our model shows strong ability on multiple applications including image-based fitting, random generation, face rigging, face editing, and novel view synthesis. Experiments show that our method achieves higher representation ability than previous parametric models, and achieves competitive performance in several applications. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first facial parametric model built upon a neural radiance field that can be used in fitting, generation and manipulation.

- **Summary**: Multi-view Stereo (MVS) with known camera parameters is essentially a 1D search problem within a valid depth range. Recent deep learning-based MVS methods typically densely sample depth hypotheses in the depth range, and then construct prohibitively memory-consuming 3D cost volumes for depth prediction. Although coarse-to-fine sampling strategies alleviate this overhead issue to a certain extent, the efficiency of MVS is still an open challenge. In this work, we propose a novel method for highly efficient MVS that remarkably decreases the memory footprint, meanwhile clearly advancing state-of-the-art depth prediction performance. We investigate what a search strategy can be reasonably optimal for MVS taking into account of both efficiency and effectiveness. We first formulate MVS as a binary search problem, and accordingly propose a generalized binary search network for MVS. Specifically, in each step, the depth range is split into 2 bins with extra 1 error tolerance bin on both sides. A classification is performed to identify which bin contains the true depth. We also design three mechanisms to respectively handle classification errors, deal with out-of-range samples and decrease the training memory. The new formulation makes our method only sample a very small number of depth hypotheses in each step, which is highly memory efficient, and also greatly facilitates quick training convergence. Experiments on competitive benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much less memory. Particularly, our method obtains an overall score of 0.289 on DTU dataset and tops the first place on challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset among all the learning-based methods. The trained models and code will be released at https://github.com/MiZhenxing/GBi-Net.

- **Summary**: We propose Unified Model of Saliency and Scanpaths (UMSS) -- a model that learns to predict visual saliency and scanpaths (i.e. sequences of eye fixations) on information visualisations. Although scanpaths provide rich information about the importance of different visualisation elements during the visual exploration process, prior work has been limited to predicting aggregated attention statistics, such as visual saliency. We present in-depth analyses of gaze behaviour for different information visualisation elements (e.g. Title, Label, Data) on the popular MASSVIS dataset. We show that while, overall, gaze patterns are surprisingly consistent across visualisations and viewers, there are also structural differences in gaze dynamics for different elements. Informed by our analyses, UMSS first predicts multi-duration element-level saliency maps, then probabilistically samples scanpaths from them. Extensive experiments on MASSVIS show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with respect to several, widely used scanpath and saliency evaluation metrics. Our method achieves a relative improvement in sequence score of 11.5% for scanpath prediction, and a relative improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient of up to 23.6% for saliency prediction. These results are auspicious and point towards richer user models and simulations of visual attention on visualisations without the need for any eye tracking equipment.



### Label Hierarchy Transition: Modeling Class Hierarchies to Enhance Deep Classifiers

- **Summary**: Hierarchical classification aims to sort the object into a hierarchy of categories. For example, a bird can be categorized according to a three-level hierarchy of order, family, and species. Existing methods commonly address hierarchical classification by decoupling it into several multi-class classification tasks. However, such a multi-task learning strategy fails to fully exploit the correlation among various categories across different hierarchies. In this paper, we propose Label Hierarchy Transition, a unified probabilistic framework based on deep learning, to address hierarchical classification. Specifically, we explicitly learn the label hierarchy transition matrices, whose column vectors represent the conditional label distributions of classes between two adjacent hierarchies and could be capable of encoding the correlation embedded in class hierarchies. We further propose a confusion loss, which encourages the classification network to learn the correlation across different label hierarchies during training. The proposed framework can be adapted to any existing deep network with only minor modifications. We experiment with three public benchmark datasets with various class hierarchies, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach beyond the prior arts. Source code will be made publicly available.



### SITA: Single Image Test-time Adaptation

- **Summary**: In Test-time Adaptation (TTA), given a source model, the goal is to adapt it to make better predictions for test instances from a different distribution than the source. Crucially, TTA assumes no access to the source data or even any additional labeled/unlabeled samples from the target distribution to finetune the source model. In this work, we consider TTA in a more pragmatic setting which we refer to as SITA (Single Image Test-time Adaptation). Here, when making a prediction, the model has access only to the given single test instance, rather than a batch of instances, as typically been considered in the literature. This is motivated by the realistic scenarios where inference is needed on-demand instead of delaying for an incoming batch or the inference is happening on an edge device (like mobile phone) where there is no scope for batching. The entire adaptation process in SITA should be extremely fast as it happens at inference time. To address this, we propose a novel approach AugBN that requires only a single forward pass. It can be used on any off-the-shelf trained model to test single instances for both classification and segmentation tasks. AugBN estimates normalization statistics of the unseen test distribution from the given test image using only one forward pass with label-preserving transformations. Since AugBN does not involve any back-propagation, it is significantly faster compared to recent test time adaptation methods. We further extend AugBN to make the algorithm hyperparameter-free. Rigorous experimentation show that our simple algorithm is able to achieve significant performance gains for a variety of datasets, tasks, and network architectures.

- **Summary**: We consider the novel problem of unsupervised domain adaptation of source models, without access to the source data for semantic segmentation. Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to adapt a model learned on the labeled source data, to a new unlabeled target dataset. Existing methods assume that the source data is available along with the target data during adaptation. However, in practical scenarios, we may only have access to the source model and the unlabeled target data, but not the labeled source, due to reasons such as privacy, storage, etc. In this work, we propose a self-training approach to extract the knowledge from the source model. To compensate for the distribution shift from source to target, we first update only the normalization parameters of the network with the unlabeled target data. Then we employ confidence-filtered pseudo labeling and enforce consistencies against certain transformations. Despite being very simple and intuitive, our framework is able to achieve significant performance gains compared to directly applying the source model on the target data as reflected in our extensive experiments and ablation studies. In fact, the performance is just a few points away from the recent state-of-the-art methods which use source data for adaptation. We further demonstrate the generalisability of the proposed approach for fully test-time adaptation setting, where we do not need any target training data and adapt only during test-time.

- **Summary**: Most of the existing bi-modal (RGB-D and RGB-T) salient object detection methods utilize the convolution operation and construct complex interweave fusion structures to achieve cross-modal information integration. The inherent local connectivity of the convolution operation constrains the performance of the convolution-based methods to a ceiling. In this work, we rethink these tasks from the perspective of global information alignment and transformation. Specifically, the proposed \underline{c}ross-mod\underline{a}l \underline{v}iew-mixed transform\underline{er} (CAVER) cascades several cross-modal integration units to construct a top-down transformer-based information propagation path. CAVER treats the multi-scale and multi-modal feature integration as a sequence-to-sequence context propagation and update process built on a novel view-mixed attention mechanism. Besides, considering the quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of input tokens, we design a parameter-free patch-wise token re-embedding strategy to simplify operations. Extensive experimental results on RGB-D and RGB-T SOD datasets demonstrate that such a simple two-stream encoder-decoder framework can surpass recent state-of-the-art methods when it is equipped with the proposed components. Code and pretrained models will be available at \href{https://github.com/lartpang/CAVER}{the link}.

- **Summary**: As a basic task of computer vision, image similarity retrieval is facing the challenge of large-scale data and image copy attacks. This paper presents our 3rd place solution to the matching track of Image Similarity Challenge (ISC) 2021 organized by Facebook AI. We propose a multi-branch retrieval method of combining global descriptors and local descriptors to cover all attack cases. Specifically, we attempt many strategies to optimize global descriptors, including abundant data augmentations, self-supervised learning with a single Transformer model, overlay detection preprocessing. Moreover, we introduce the robust SIFT feature and GPU Faiss for local retrieval which makes up for the shortcomings of the global retrieval. Finally, KNN-matching algorithm is used to judge the match and merge scores. We show some ablation experiments of our method, which reveals the complementary advantages of global and local features.

- **Summary**: In many applications of long-range imaging, we are faced with a scenario where a person appearing in the captured imagery is often degraded by atmospheric turbulence. However, restoring such degraded images for face verification is difficult since the degradation causes images to be geometrically distorted and blurry. To mitigate the turbulence effect, in this paper, we propose the first turbulence mitigation method that makes use of visual priors encapsulated by a well-trained GAN. Based on the visual priors, we propose to learn to preserve the identity of restored images on a spatial periodic contextual distance. Such a distance can keep the realism of restored images from the GAN while considering the identity difference at the network learning. In addition, hierarchical pseudo connections are proposed for facilitating the identity-preserving learning by introducing more appearance variance without identity changing. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms prior art in both the visual quality and face verification accuracy of restored results.

- **Summary**: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has drawn increasing attention recently for its transferable visual representation learning. However, due to the semantic gap within datasets, CLIP's pre-trained image-text alignment becomes sub-optimal on downstream tasks, which severely harms its transferring performance. To better adapt the cross-modality embedding space, we propose to enhance CLIP via Visual-guided Texts, named VT-CLIP. Specifically, we guide textual features of different categories to adaptively explore informative regions on the image and aggregate visual features by attention mechanisms. In this way, the texts become visual-guided, namely, more semantically correlated with downstream images, which greatly benefits the category-wise matching process. In few-shot settings, we evaluate our VT-CLIP on 11 well-known classification datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Recently, zero-shot and few-shot learning via Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training (CLIP) have shown inspirational performance on 2D visual recognition, which learns to match images with their corresponding texts in open-vocabulary settings. However, it remains under explored that whether CLIP, pre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, can be generalized to 3D recognition. In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposing PointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point cloud and 3D category texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it into multi-view depth maps without rendering, and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot prediction to achieve knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. On top of that, we design an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and adaptively fuse the few-shot knowledge learned from 3D into CLIP pre-trained in 2D. By just fine-tuning the lightweight adapter in the few-shot settings, the performance of PointCLIP could be largely improved. In addition, we observe the complementary property between PointCLIP and classical 3D-supervised networks. By simple ensembling, PointCLIP boosts baseline's performance and even surpasses state-of-the-art models. Therefore, PointCLIP is a promising alternative for effective 3D point cloud understanding via CLIP under low resource cost and data regime. We conduct thorough experiments on widely-adopted ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and the challenging ScanObjectNN to demonstrate the effectiveness of PointCLIP. The code is released at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/PointCLIP.

- **Summary**: Gated cameras hold promise as an alternative to scanning LiDAR sensors with high-resolution 3D depth that is robust to back-scatter in fog, snow, and rain. Instead of sequentially scanning a scene and directly recording depth via the photon time-of-flight, as in pulsed LiDAR sensors, gated imagers encode depth in the relative intensity of a handful of gated slices, captured at megapixel resolution. Although existing methods have shown that it is possible to decode high-resolution depth from such measurements, these methods require synchronized and calibrated LiDAR to supervise the gated depth decoder -- prohibiting fast adoption across geographies, training on large unpaired datasets, and exploring alternative applications outside of automotive use cases. In this work, we fill this gap and propose an entirely self-supervised depth estimation method that uses gated intensity profiles and temporal consistency as a training signal. The proposed model is trained end-to-end from gated video sequences, does not require LiDAR or RGB data, and learns to estimate absolute depth values. We take gated slices as input and disentangle the estimation of the scene albedo, depth, and ambient light, which are then used to learn to reconstruct the input slices through a cyclic loss. We rely on temporal consistency between a given frame and neighboring gated slices to estimate depth in regions with shadows and reflections. We experimentally validate that the proposed approach outperforms existing supervised and self-supervised depth estimation methods based on monocular RGB and stereo images, as well as supervised methods based on gated images.

- **Summary**: Predicting wildfire spread is critical for land management and disaster preparedness. To this end, we present `Next Day Wildfire Spread,' a curated, large-scale, multivariate data set of historical wildfires aggregating nearly a decade of remote-sensing data across the United States. In contrast to existing fire data sets based on Earth observation satellites, our data set combines 2D fire data with multiple explanatory variables (e.g., topography, vegetation, weather, drought index, population density) aligned over 2D regions, providing a feature-rich data set for machine learning. To demonstrate the usefulness of this data set, we implement a neural network that takes advantage of the spatial information of this data to predict wildfire spread. We compare the performance of the neural network with other machine learning models: logistic regression and random forest. This data set can be used as a benchmark for developing wildfire propagation models based on remote sensing data for a lead time of one day.

- **Summary**: Training of generative models especially Generative Adversarial Networks can easily diverge in low-data setting. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel implicit data augmentation approach which facilitates stable training and synthesize high-quality samples without need of label information. Specifically, we view the discriminator as a metric embedding of the real data manifold, which offers proper distances between real data points. We then utilize information in the feature space to develop a fully unsupervised and data-driven augmentation method. Experiments on few-shot generation tasks show the proposed method significantly improve results from strong baselines with hundreds of training samples.

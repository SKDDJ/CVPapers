- **Summary**: The underlying loss landscapes of deep neural networks have a great impact on their training, but they have mainly been studied theoretically due to computational constraints. This work vastly reduces the time required to compute such loss landscapes, and uses them to study winning lottery tickets found via iterative magnitude pruning. We also share results that contradict previously claimed correlations between certain loss landscape projection methods and model trainability and generalization error.

- **Summary**: Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) image resolution is constrained by waveform bandwidth and array geometry. Specifically, the waveform bandwidth determines a point spread function (PSF) that blurs the locations of point scatterers in the scene. In theory, deconvolving the reconstructed SAS image with the scene PSF restores the original distribution of scatterers and yields sharper reconstructions. However, deconvolution is an ill-posed operation that is highly sensitive to noise. In this work, we leverage implicit neural representations (INRs), shown to be strong priors for the natural image space, to deconvolve SAS images. Importantly, our method does not require training data, as we perform our deconvolution through an analysis-bysynthesis optimization in a self-supervised fashion. We validate our method on simulated SAS data created with a point scattering model and real data captured with an in-air circular SAS. This work is an important first step towards applying neural networks for SAS image deconvolution.

- **Summary**: Learning to reject unknown samples (not present in the source classes) in the target domain is fairly important for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). There exist two typical UDA scenarios, i.e., open-set, and open-partial-set, and the latter assumes that not all source classes appear in the target domain. However, most prior methods are designed for one UDA scenario and always perform badly on the other UDA scenario. Moreover, they also require the labeled source data during adaptation, limiting their usability in data privacy-sensitive applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Universal Model ADaptation (UMAD) framework which handles both UDA scenarios without access to the source data nor prior knowledge about the category shift between domains. Specifically, we aim to learn a source model with an elegantly designed two-head classifier and provide it to the target domain. During adaptation, we develop an informative consistency score to help distinguish unknown samples from known samples. To achieve bilateral adaptation in the target domain, we further maximize localized mutual information to align known samples with the source classifier and employ an entropic loss to push unknown samples far away from the source classification boundary, respectively. Experiments on open-set and open-partial-set UDA scenarios demonstrate that UMAD, as a unified approach without access to source data, exhibits comparable, if not superior, performance to state-of-the-art data-dependent methods.

- **Summary**: Multimodal summarization with multimodal output (MSMO) generates a summary with both textual and visual content. Multimodal news report contains heterogeneous contents, which makes MSMO nontrivial. Moreover, it is observed that different modalities of data in the news report correlate hierarchically. Traditional MSMO methods indistinguishably handle different modalities of data by learning a representation for the whole data, which is not directly adaptable to the heterogeneous contents and hierarchical correlation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cross-modality semantic correlation learning model (HCSCL) to learn the intra- and inter-modal correlation existing in the multimodal data. HCSCL adopts a graph network to encode the intra-modal correlation. Then, a hierarchical fusion framework is proposed to learn the hierarchical correlation between text and images. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset with relevant image annotation and image object label information to provide the supervision information for the learning procedure. Extensive experiments on the dataset show that HCSCL significantly outperforms the baseline methods in automatic summarization metrics and fine-grained diversity tests.

- **Summary**: Answering complex questions about images is an ambitious goal for machine intelligence, which requires a joint understanding of images, text, and commonsense knowledge, as well as a strong reasoning ability. Recently, multimodal Transformers have made great progress in the task of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), by jointly understanding visual objects and text tokens through layers of cross-modality attention. However, these approaches do not utilize the rich structure of the scene and the interactions between objects which are essential in answering complex commonsense questions. We propose a Scene Graph Enhanced Image-Text Learning (SGEITL) framework to incorporate visual scene graphs in commonsense reasoning. To exploit the scene graph structure, at the model structure level, we propose a multihop graph transformer for regularizing attention interaction among hops. As for pre-training, a scene-graph-aware pre-training method is proposed to leverage structure knowledge extracted in the visual scene graph. Moreover, we introduce a method to train and generate domain-relevant visual scene graphs using textual annotations in a weakly-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on VCR and other tasks show a significant performance boost compared with the state-of-the-art methods and prove the efficacy of each proposed component.

- **Summary**: Detecting out-of-context media, such as "mis-captioned" images on Twitter, is a relevant problem, especially in domains of high public significance. In this work we aim to develop defenses against such misinformation for the topics of Climate Change, COVID-19, and Military Vehicles. We first present a large-scale multimodal dataset with over 884k tweets relevant to these topics. Next, we propose a detection method, based on the state-of-the-art CLIP model, that leverages automatically generated hard image-text mismatches. While this approach works well on our automatically constructed out-of-context tweets, we aim to validate its usefulness on data representative of the real world. Thus, we test it on a set of human-generated fakes created by mimicking in-the-wild misinformation. We achieve an 11% detection improvement in a high precision regime over a strong baseline. Finally, we share insights about our best model design and analyze the challenges of this emerging threat.

- **Summary**: The size and frequency of wildland fires in the western United States have dramatically increased in recent years. On high-fire-risk days, a small fire ignition can rapidly grow and become out of control. Early detection of fire ignitions from initial smoke can assist the response to such fires before they become difficult to manage. Past deep learning approaches for wildfire smoke detection have suffered from small or unreliable datasets that make it difficult to extrapolate performance to real-world scenarios. In this work, we present the Fire Ignition Library (FIgLib), a publicly available dataset of nearly 25,000 labeled wildfire smoke images as seen from fixed-view cameras deployed in Southern California. We also introduce SmokeyNet, a novel deep learning architecture using spatiotemporal information from camera imagery for real-time wildfire smoke detection. When trained on the FIgLib dataset, SmokeyNet outperforms comparable baselines and rivals human performance. We hope that the availability of the FIgLib dataset and the SmokeyNet architecture will inspire further research into deep learning methods for wildfire smoke detection, leading to automated notification systems that reduce the time to wildfire response.

- **Summary**: During the past decade breakthroughs in GPU hardware and deep neural networks technologies have revolutionized the field of computer vision, making image analytical potentials accessible to a range of real-world applications. Technology Assisted Review (TAR) in electronic discovery though traditionally has dominantly dealt with textual content, is witnessing a rising need to incorporate multimedia content in the scope. We have developed innovative image analytics applications for TAR in the past years, such as image classification, image clustering, and object detection, etc. In this paper, we discuss the use of image clustering applications to facilitate TAR based on our experiences in serving clients. We describe our general workflow on leveraging image clustering in tasks and use statistics from real projects to showcase the effectiveness of using image clustering in TAR. We also summarize lessons learned and best practices on using image clustering in TAR.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to improve the generalization ability of detectors when the training and test data are from different domains. Considering the significant domain gap, some typical methods, e.g., CycleGAN-based methods, adopt the intermediate domain to bridge the source and target domains progressively. However, the CycleGAN-based intermediate domain lacks the pix- or instance-level supervision for object detection, which leads to semantic differences. To address this problem, in this paper, we introduce a Frequency Spectrum Augmentation Consistency (FSAC) framework with four different low-frequency filter operations. In this way, we can obtain a series of augmented data as the intermediate domain. Concretely, we propose a two-stage optimization framework. In the first stage, we utilize all the original and augmented source data to train an object detector. In the second stage, augmented source and target data with pseudo labels are adopted to perform the self-training for prediction consistency. And a teacher model optimized using Mean Teacher is used to further revise the pseudo labels. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on the single- and compound- target DAOD separately, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: Human action recognition still exists many challenging problems such as different viewpoints, occlusion, lighting conditions, human body size and the speed of action execution, although it has been widely used in different areas. To tackle these challenges, the Kinect depth sensor has been developed to record real time depth sequences, which are insensitive to the color of human clothes and illumination conditions. Many methods on recognizing human action have been reported in the literature such as HON4D, HOPC, RBD and HDG, which use the 4D surface normals, pointclouds, skeleton-based model and depth gradients respectively to capture discriminative information from depth videos or skeleton data. In this research project, the performance of four aforementioned algorithms will be analyzed and evaluated using five benchmark datasets, which cover challenging issues such as noise, change of viewpoints, background clutters and occlusions. We also implemented and improved the HDG algorithm, and applied it in cross-view action recognition using the UWA3D Multiview Activity dataset. Moreover, we used different combinations of individual feature vectors in HDG for performance evaluation. The experimental results show that our improvement of HDG outperforms other three state-of-the-art algorithms for cross-view action recognition.

- **Summary**: Structure from motion (SFM) and ground plane homography estimation are critical to autonomous driving and other robotics applications. Recently, much progress has been made in using deep neural networks for SFM and homography estimation respectively. However, directly applying existing methods for ground plane homography estimation may fail because the road is often a small part of the scene. Besides, the performances of deep SFM approaches are still inferior to traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a method that learns to solve both problems in an end-to-end manner, improving performance on both. The proposed networks consist of a Depth-CNN, a Pose-CNN and a Ground-CNN. The Depth-CNN and Pose-CNN estimate dense depth map and ego-motion respectively, solving SFM, while the Pose-CNN and Ground-CNN followed by a homography layer solve the ground plane estimation problem. By enforcing coherency between SFM and homography estimation results, the whole network can be trained end to end using photometric loss and homography loss without any groundtruth except the road segmentation provided by an off-the-shelf segmenter. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on KITTI benchmark to demonstrate promising results compared with various state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) tackles the novel class recognition problem by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Existing attention-based models have struggled to learn inferior region features in a single image by solely using unidirectional attention, which ignore the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of visual features. In this paper, we propose a cross attribute-guided Transformer network, termed TransZero++, to refine visual features and learn accurate attribute localization for semantic-augmented visual embedding representations in ZSL. TransZero++ consists of an attribute$\rightarrow$visual Transformer sub-net (AVT) and a visual$\rightarrow$attribute Transformer sub-net (VAT). Specifically, AVT first takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate the cross-dataset problem, and improves the transferability of visual features by reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. Then, an attribute$\rightarrow$visual decoder is employed to localize the image regions most relevant to each attribute in a given image for attribute-based visual feature representations. Analogously, VAT uses the similar feature augmentation encoder to refine the visual features, which are further applied in visual$\rightarrow$attribute decoder to learn visual-based attribute features. By further introducing semantical collaborative losses, the two attribute-guided transformers teach each other to learn semantic-augmented visual embeddings via semantical collaborative learning. Extensive experiments show that TransZero++ achieves the new state-of-the-art results on three challenging ZSL benchmarks.

### A comparative study of paired versus unpaired deep learning methods for physically enhancing digital rock image resolution

- **Summary**: X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has been widely leveraged to characterise pore-scale geometry in subsurface porous rock. Recent developments in super resolution (SR) methods using deep learning allow the digital enhancement of low resolution (LR) images over large spatial scales, creating SR images comparable to the high resolution (HR) ground truth. This circumvents traditional resolution and field-of-view trade-offs. An outstanding issue is the use of paired (registered) LR and HR data, which is often required in the training step of such methods but is difficult to obtain. In this work, we rigorously compare two different state-of-the-art SR deep learning techniques, using both paired and unpaired data, with like-for-like ground truth data. The first approach requires paired images to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) while the second approach uses unpaired images to train a generative adversarial network (GAN). The two approaches are compared using a micro-CT carbonate rock sample with complicated micro-porous textures. We implemented various image based and numerical verifications and experimental validation to quantitatively evaluate the physical accuracy and sensitivities of the two methods. Our quantitative results show that unpaired GAN approach can reconstruct super-resolution images as precise as paired CNN method, with comparable training times and dataset requirement. This unlocks new applications for micro-CT image enhancement using unpaired deep learning methods; image registration is no longer needed during the data processing stage. Decoupled images from data storage platforms can be exploited more efficiently to train networks for SR digital rock applications. This opens up a new pathway for various applications of multi-scale flow simulation in heterogeneous porous media.

- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection as a downstream of object detection tasks requires localizing pairs of humans and objects and extracting the semantic relationships between humans and objects from an image. Recently, one-stage approaches have become a new trend for this task due to their high efficiency. However, these approaches focus on detecting possible interaction points or filtering human-object pairs, ignoring the variability in the location and size of different objects at spatial scales. To address this problem, we propose a transformer-based method, QAHOI (Query-Based Anchors for Human-Object Interaction detection), which leverages a multi-scale architecture to extract features from different spatial scales and uses query-based anchors to predict all the elements of an HOI instance. We further investigate that a powerful backbone significantly increases accuracy for QAHOI, and QAHOI with a transformer-based backbone outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by large margins on the HICO-DET benchmark.

- **Summary**: The mainstream paradigm behind continual learning has been to adapt the model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, where catastrophic forgetting is the central challenge. Typical methods rely on a rehearsal buffer or known task identity at test time to retrieve learned knowledge and address forgetting, while this work presents a new paradigm for continual learning that aims to train a more succinct memory system without accessing task identity at test time. Our method learns to dynamically prompt (L2P) a pre-trained model to learn tasks sequentially under different task transitions. In our proposed framework, prompts are small learnable parameters, which are maintained in a memory space. The objective is to optimize prompts to instruct the model prediction and explicitly manage task-invariant and task-specific knowledge while maintaining model plasticity. We conduct comprehensive experiments under popular image classification benchmarks with different challenging continual learning settings, where L2P consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Surprisingly, L2P achieves competitive results against rehearsal-based methods even without a rehearsal buffer and is directly applicable to challenging task-agnostic continual learning.

- **Summary**: In this paper we consider the problem of unsupervised anomaly segmentation in medical images, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to the expensive pixel-level annotations from experts and the existence of a large amount of unannotated normal and abnormal image scans. We introduce a segmentation network that utilizes adversarial learning to partition an image into two cuts, with one of them falling into a reference distribution provided by the user. This Adversarial-based Selective Cutting network (ASC-Net) bridges the two domains of cluster-based deep segmentation and adversarial-based anomaly/novelty detection algorithms. Our ASC-Net learns from normal and abnormal medical scans to segment anomalies in medical scans without any masks for supervision. We evaluate this unsupervised anomly segmentation model on three public datasets, i.e., BraTS 2019 for brain tumor segmentation, LiTS for liver lesion segmentation, and MS-SEG 2015 for brain lesion segmentation, and also on a private dataset for brain tumor segmentation. Compared to existing methods, our model demonstrates tremendous performance gains in unsupervised anomaly segmentation tasks. Although there is still room to further improve performance compared to supervised learning algorithms, the promising experimental results and interesting observations shed light on building an unsupervised learning algorithm for medical anomaly identification using user-defined knowledge.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks based single-image super-resolution (SISR) has made great progress in recent years. However, it is difficult to apply these methods to real-world scenarios due to the computational and memory cost. Meanwhile, how to take full advantage of the intermediate features under the constraints of limited parameters and calculations is also a huge challenge. To alleviate these issues, we propose a lightweight yet efficient Feature Distillation Interaction Weighted Network (FDIWN). Specifically, FDIWN utilizes a series of specially designed Feature Shuffle Weighted Groups (FSWG) as the backbone, and several novel mutual Wide-residual Distillation Interaction Blocks (WDIB) form an FSWG. In addition, Wide Identical Residual Weighting (WIRW) units and Wide Convolutional Residual Weighting (WCRW) units are introduced into WDIB for better feature distillation. Moreover, a Wide-Residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) framework and a Self-Calibration Fusion (SCF) unit are proposed to interact features with different scales more flexibly and efficiently.Extensive experiments show that our FDIWN is superior to other models to strike a good balance between model performance and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Domain generalizable (DG) person re-identification (ReID) aims to test across unseen domains without access to the target domain data at training time, which is a realistic but challenging problem. In contrast to methods assuming an identical model for different domains, Mixture of Experts (MoE) exploits multiple domain-specific networks for leveraging complementary information between domains, obtaining impressive results. However, prior MoE-based DG ReID methods suffer from a large model size with the increase of the number of source domains, and most of them overlook the exploitation of domain-invariant characteristics. To handle the two issues above, this paper presents a new approach called Mimic Embedding via adapTive Aggregation (META) for DG person ReID. To avoid the large model size, experts in META do not adopt a branch network for each source domain but share all the parameters except for the batch normalization layers. Besides multiple experts, META leverages Instance Normalization (IN) and introduces it into a global branch to pursue invariant features across domains. Meanwhile, META considers the relevance of an unseen target sample and source domains via normalization statistics and develops an aggregation module to adaptively integrate multiple experts for mimicking unseen target domain. Benefiting from a proposed consistency loss and an episodic training algorithm, META is expected to mimic embedding for a truly unseen target domain. Extensive experiments verify that META surpasses state-of-the-art DG person ReID methods by a large margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/xbq1994/META.

- **Summary**: Deep neural network-based image compression has been extensively studied. However, the model robustness which is crucial to practical application is largely overlooked. We propose to examine the robustness of prevailing learned image compression models by injecting negligible adversarial perturbation into the original source image. Severe distortion in decoded reconstruction reveals the general vulnerability in existing methods regardless of their settings (e.g., network architecture, loss function, quality scale). A variety of defense strategies including geometric self-ensemble based pre-processing, and adversarial training, are investigated against the adversarial attack to improve the model's robustness. Later the defense efficiency is further exemplified in real-life image recompression case studies. Overall, our methodology is simple, effective, and generalizable, making it attractive for developing robust learned image compression solutions.

- **Summary**: We present a self-supervised pre-training approach for learning rich visual language representations for both handwritten and printed historical document transcription. After supervised fine-tuning of our pre-trained encoder representations for low-resource document transcription on two languages, (1) a heterogeneous set of handwritten Islamicate manuscript images and (2) early modern English printed documents, we show a meaningful improvement in recognition accuracy over the same supervised model trained from scratch with as few as 30 line image transcriptions for training. Our masked language model-style pre-training strategy, where the model is trained to be able to identify the true masked visual representation from distractors sampled from within the same line, encourages learning robust contextualized language representations invariant to scribal writing style and printing noise present across documents.

- **Summary**: We propose a cross-modal attention distillation framework to train a dual-encoder model for vision-language understanding tasks, such as visual reasoning and visual question answering. Dual-encoder models have a faster inference speed than fusion-encoder models and enable the pre-computation of images and text during inference. However, the shallow interaction module used in dual-encoder models is insufficient to handle complex vision-language understanding tasks. In order to learn deep interactions of images and text, we introduce cross-modal attention distillation, which uses the image-to-text and text-to-image attention distributions of a fusion-encoder model to guide the training of our dual-encoder model. In addition, we show that applying the cross-modal attention distillation for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages achieves further improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that the distilled dual-encoder model achieves competitive performance for visual reasoning, visual entailment and visual question answering tasks while enjoying a much faster inference speed than fusion-encoder models. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kugwzk/Distilled-DualEncoder.

- **Summary**: The widespread diffusion of synthetically generated content is a serious threat that needs urgent countermeasures. As a matter of fact, the generation of synthetic content is not restricted to multimedia data like videos, photographs or audio sequences, but covers a significantly vast area that can include biological images as well, such as western blot and microscopic images. In this paper, we focus on the detection of synthetically generated western blot images. These images are largely explored in the biomedical literature and it has been already shown they can be easily counterfeited with few hopes to spot manipulations by visual inspection or by using standard forensics detectors. To overcome the absence of publicly available data for this task, we create a new dataset comprising more than 14K original western blot images and 24K synthetic western blot images, generated using four different state-of-the-art generation methods. We investigate different strategies to detect synthetic western blots, exploring binary classification methods as well as one-class detectors. In both scenarios, we never exploit synthetic western blot images at training stage. The achieved results show that synthetically generated western blot images can be spot with good accuracy, even though the exploited detectors are not optimized over synthetic versions of these scientific images. We also test the robustness of the developed detectors against post-processing operations commonly performed on scientific images, showing that we can be robust to JPEG compression and that some generative models are easily recognizable, despite the application of editing might alter the artifacts they leave.

- **Summary**: Occluded person re-identification (ReID) aims at matching occluded person images to holistic ones across different camera views. Target Pedestrians (TP) are usually disturbed by Non-Pedestrian Occlusions (NPO) and NonTarget Pedestrians (NTP). Previous methods mainly focus on increasing model's robustness against NPO while ignoring feature contamination from NTP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Erasing and Diffusion Network (FED) to simultaneously handle NPO and NTP. Specifically, NPO features are eliminated by our proposed Occlusion Erasing Module (OEM), aided by the NPO augmentation strategy which simulates NPO on holistic pedestrian images and generates precise occlusion masks. Subsequently, we Subsequently, we diffuse the pedestrian representations with other memorized features to synthesize NTP characteristics in the feature space which is achieved by a novel Feature Diffusion Module (FDM) through a learnable cross attention mechanism. With the guidance of the occlusion scores from OEM, the feature diffusion process is mainly conducted on visible body parts, which guarantees the quality of the synthesized NTP characteristics. By jointly optimizing OEM and FDM in our proposed FED network, we can greatly improve the model's perception ability towards TP and alleviate the influence of NPO and NTP. Furthermore, the proposed FDM only works as an auxiliary module for training and will be discarded in the inference phase, thus introducing little inference computational overhead. Experiments on occluded and holistic person ReID benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FED over state-of-the-arts, where FED achieves 86.3% Rank-1 accuracy on Occluded-REID, surpassing others by at least 4.7%.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a radio-assisted human detection framework by incorporating radio information into the state-of-the-art detection methods, including anchor-based onestage detectors and two-stage detectors. We extract the radio localization and identifer information from the radio signals to assist the human detection, due to which the problem of false positives and false negatives can be greatly alleviated. For both detectors, we use the confidence score revision based on the radio localization to improve the detection performance. For two-stage detection methods, we propose to utilize the region proposals generated from radio localization rather than relying on region proposal network (RPN). Moreover, with the radio identifier information, a non-max suppression method with the radio localization constraint has also been proposed to further suppress the false detections and reduce miss detections. Experiments on the simulative Microsoft COCO dataset and Caltech pedestrian datasets show that the mean average precision (mAP) and the miss rate of the state-of-the-art detection methods can be improved with the aid of radio information. Finally, we conduct experiments in real-world scenarios to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method in practice.

- **Summary**: Sports video analysis is a prevalent research topic due to the variety of application areas, ranging from multimedia intelligent devices with user-tailored digests up to analysis of athletes' performance. The Sports Video task is part of the MediaEval 2021 benchmark. This task tackles fine-grained action detection and classification from videos. The focus is on recordings of table tennis games. Running since 2019, the task has offered a classification challenge from untrimmed video recorded in natural conditions with known temporal boundaries for each stroke. This year, the dataset is extended and offers, in addition, a detection challenge from untrimmed videos without annotations. This work aims at creating tools for sports coaches and players in order to analyze sports performance. Movement analysis and player profiling may be built upon such technology to enrich the training experience of athletes and improve their performance.

- **Summary**: Neural image coding represents now the state-of-the-art image compression approach. However, a lot of work is still to be done in the video domain. In this work, we propose an end-to-end learned video codec that introduces several architectural novelties as well as training novelties, revolving around the concepts of adaptation and attention. Our codec is organized as an intra-frame codec paired with an inter-frame codec. As one architectural novelty, we propose to train the inter-frame codec model to adapt the motion estimation process based on the resolution of the input video. A second architectural novelty is a new neural block that combines concepts from split-attention based neural networks and from DenseNets. Finally, we propose to overfit a set of decoder-side multiplicative parameters at inference time. Through ablation studies and comparisons to prior art, we show the benefits of our proposed techniques in terms of coding gains. We compare our codec to VVC/H.266 and RLVC, which represent the state-of-the-art traditional and end-to-end learned codecs, respectively, and to the top performing end-to-end learned approach in 2021 CLIC competition, E2E_T_OL. Our codec clearly outperforms E2E_T_OL, and compare favorably to VVC and RLVC in some settings.

- **Summary**: Predicting the object's 6D pose from a single RGB image is a fundamental computer vision task. Generally, the distance between transformed object vertices is employed as an objective function for pose estimation methods. However, projective geometry in the camera space is not considered in those methods and causes performance degradation. In this regard, we propose a new pose estimation system based on a projective grid instead of object vertices. Our pose estimation method, dynamic projective spatial transformer network (DProST), localizes the region of interest grid on the rays in camera space and transforms the grid to object space by estimated pose. The transformed grid is used as both a sampling grid and a new criterion of the estimated pose. Additionally, because DProST does not require object vertices, our method can be used in a mesh-less setting by replacing the mesh with a reconstructed feature. Experimental results show that mesh-less DProST outperforms the state-of-the-art mesh-based methods on the LINEMOD and LINEMOD-OCCLUSION dataset, and shows competitive performance on the YCBV dataset with mesh data.

- **Summary**: Traffic sign detection is a challenging task for the unmanned driving system, especially for the detection of multi-scale targets and the real-time problem of detection. In the traffic sign detection process, the scale of the targets changes greatly, which will have a certain impact on the detection accuracy. Feature pyramid is widely used to solve this problem but it might break the feature consistency across different scales of traffic signs. Moreover, in practical application, it is difficult for common methods to improve the detection accuracy of multi-scale traffic signs while ensuring real-time detection. In this paper, we propose an improved feature pyramid model, named AF-FPN, which utilizes the adaptive attention module (AAM) and feature enhancement module (FEM) to reduce the information loss in the process of feature map generation and enhance the representation ability of the feature pyramid. We replaced the original feature pyramid network in YOLOv5 with AF-FPN, which improves the detection performance for multi-scale targets of the YOLOv5 network under the premise of ensuring real-time detection. Furthermore, a new automatic learning data augmentation method is proposed to enrich the dataset and improve the robustness of the model to make it more suitable for practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: The Mixup scheme suggests mixing a pair of samples to create an augmented training sample and has gained considerable attention recently for improving the generalizability of neural networks. A straightforward and widely used extension of Mixup is to combine with regional dropout-like methods: removing random patches from a sample and replacing it with the features from another sample. Albeit their simplicity and effectiveness, these methods are prone to create harmful samples due to their randomness. To address this issue, 'maximum saliency' strategies were recently proposed: they select only the most informative features to prevent such a phenomenon. However, they now suffer from lack of sample diversification as they always deterministically select regions with maximum saliency, injecting bias into the augmented data. In this paper, we present, a novel, yet simple Mixup-variant that captures the best of both worlds. Our idea is two-fold. By stochastically sampling the features and 'grafting' them onto another sample, our method effectively generates diverse yet meaningful samples. Its second ingredient is to produce the label of the grafted sample by mixing the labels in a saliency-calibrated fashion, which rectifies supervision misguidance introduced by the random sampling procedure. Our experiments under CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets show that our scheme outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation strategies not only in terms of classification accuracy, but is also superior in coping under stress conditions such as data corruption and object occlusion.

- **Summary**: Despite remarkable progress on visual recognition tasks, deep neural-nets still struggle to generalize well when training data is scarce or highly imbalanced, rendering them extremely vulnerable to real-world examples. In this paper, we present a surprisingly simple yet highly effective method to mitigate this limitation: using pure noise images as additional training data. Unlike the common use of additive noise or adversarial noise for data augmentation, we propose an entirely different perspective by directly training on pure random noise images. We present a new Distribution-Aware Routing Batch Normalization layer (DAR-BN), which enables training on pure noise images in addition to natural images within the same network. This encourages generalization and suppresses overfitting. Our proposed method significantly improves imbalanced classification performance, obtaining state-of-the-art results on a large variety of long-tailed image classification datasets (CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and CelebA-5). Furthermore, our method is extremely simple and easy to use as a general new augmentation tool (on top of existing augmentations), and can be incorporated in any training scheme. It does not require any specialized data generation or training procedures, thus keeping training fast and efficient.

- **Summary**: Despite significant improvements on the image generation performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generations with low visual fidelity still have been observed. As widely used metrics for GANs focus more on the overall performance of the model, evaluation on the quality of individual generations or detection of defective generations is challenging. While recent studies try to detect featuremap units that cause artifacts and evaluate individual samples, these approaches require additional resources such as external networks or a number of training data to approximate the real data manifold. In this work, we propose the concept of local activation, and devise a metric on the local activation to detect artifact generations without additional supervision. We empirically verify that our approach can detect and correct artifact generations from GANs with various datasets. Finally, we discuss a geometrical analysis to partially reveal the relation between the proposed concept and low visual fidelity.

- **Summary**: In hash-based image retrieval systems, degraded or transformed inputs usually generate different codes from the original, deteriorating the retrieval accuracy. To mitigate this issue, data augmentation can be applied during training. However, even if augmented samples of an image are similar in real feature space, the quantization can scatter them far away in Hamming space. This results in representation discrepancies that can impede training and degrade performance. In this work, we propose a novel self-distilled hashing scheme to minimize the discrepancy while exploiting the potential of augmented data. By transferring the hash knowledge of the weakly-transformed samples to the strong ones, we make the hash code insensitive to various transformations. We also introduce hash proxy-based similarity learning and binary cross entropy-based quantization loss to provide fine quality hash codes. Ultimately, we construct a deep hashing framework that not only improves the existing deep hashing approaches, but also achieves the state-of-the-art retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted and confirm the effectiveness of our work.

- **Summary**: Studying cell morphology changes in time is critical to understanding cell migration mechanisms. In this work, we present a deep learning-based workflow to segment cancer cells embedded in 3D collagen matrices and imaged with phase-contrast microscopy. Our approach uses transfer learning and recurrent convolutional long-short term memory units to exploit the temporal information from the past and provide a consistent segmentation result. Lastly, we propose a geometrical-characterization approach to studying cancer cell morphology. Our approach provides stable results in time, and it is robust to the different weight initialization or training data sampling. We introduce a new annotated dataset for 2D cell segmentation and tracking, and an open-source implementation to replicate the experiments or adapt them to new image processing problems.

Latent semantics discovered by unsupervised methods are relatively less disentangled than supervised methods since they do not use pre-trained attribute classifiers. We propose Scale Ranking Estimator (SRE), which is trained using self-supervision. SRE enhances the disentanglement in directions obtained by existing unsupervised disentanglement techniques. These directions are updated to preserve the ordering of variation within each direction in latent space. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the discovered directions demonstrates that our proposed method significantly improves disentanglement in various datasets. We also show that the learned SRE can be used to perform Attribute-based image retrieval task without further training.

- **Summary**: In digital pathology, many image analysis tasks are challenged by the need for large and time-consuming manual data annotations to cope with various sources of variability in the image domain. Unsupervised domain adaptation based on image-to-image translation is gaining importance in this field by addressing variabilities without the manual overhead. Here, we tackle the variation of different histological stains by unsupervised stain-to-stain translation to enable a stain-independent applicability of a deep learning segmentation model. We use CycleGANs for stain-to-stain translation in kidney histopathology, and propose two novel approaches to improve translational effectivity. First, we integrate a prior segmentation network into the CycleGAN for a self-supervised, application-oriented optimization of translation through semantic guidance, and second, we incorporate extra channels to the translation output to implicitly separate artificial meta-information otherwise encoded for tackling underdetermined reconstructions. The latter showed partially superior performances to the unmodified CycleGAN, but the former performed best in all stains providing instance-level Dice scores ranging between 78% and 92% for most kidney structures, such as glomeruli, tubules, and veins. However, CycleGANs showed only limited performance in the translation of other structures, e.g. arteries. Our study also found somewhat lower performance for all structures in all stains when compared to segmentation in the original stain. Our study suggests that with current unsupervised technologies, it seems unlikely to produce generally applicable simulated stains.

- **Summary**: Time series data of urban land cover is of great utility in analyzing urban growth patterns, changes in distribution of impervious surface and vegetation and resulting impacts on urban micro climate. While Landsat data is ideal for such analysis due to the long time series of free imagery, traditional per-pixel hard classification fails to yield full potential of the Landsat data. This paper proposes a sub-pixel classification method that leverages the temporal overlap of Landsat-5 TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS-IV sensors. We train a convolutional neural network to predict fractional land cover maps from 30m Landsat-5 TM data. The reference land cover fractions are estimated from a hard-classified 5.8m LISS-IV image for Bengaluru from 2011. Further, we demonstrate the generalizability and superior performance of the proposed model using data for Mumbai from 2009 and comparing it to the results obtained using a Random Forest classifier. For both Bengaluru (2011) and Mumbai (2009) data, Mean Absolute Percentage Error of our CNN model is in the range of 7.2 to 11.3 for both built-up and vegetation fraction prediction at the 30m cell level. Unlike most recent studies where validation is conducted using data for a limited spatial extent, our model has been trained and validated using data for the complete spatial extent of two mega cities for two different time periods. Hence it can reliably generate 30m built-up and vegetation fraction maps from Landsat-5 TM time series data to analyze long term urban growth patterns.

- **Summary**: When many labels are possible, choosing a single one can lead to low precision. A common alternative, referred to as top-$K$ classification, is to choose some number $K$ (commonly around 5) and to return the $K$ labels with the highest scores. Unfortunately, for unambiguous cases, $K>1$ is too many and, for very ambiguous cases, $K \leq 5$ (for example) can be too small. An alternative sensible strategy is to use an adaptive approach in which the number of labels returned varies as a function of the computed ambiguity, but must average to some particular $K$ over all the samples. We denote this alternative average-$K$ classification. This paper formally characterizes the ambiguity profile when average-$K$ classification can achieve a lower error rate than a fixed top-$K$ classification. Moreover, it provides natural estimation procedures for both the fixed-size and the adaptive classifier and proves their consistency. Finally, it reports experiments on real-world image data sets revealing the benefit of average-$K$ classification over top-$K$ in practice. Overall, when the ambiguity is known precisely, average-$K$ is never worse than top-$K$, and, in our experiments, when it is estimated, this also holds.

- **Summary**: We present a multi-camera LiDAR inertial dataset of 4.5 km walking distance as an expansion of the Newer College Dataset. The global shutter multi-camera device is hardware synchronized with both the IMU and LiDAR, which is more accurate than the original dataset with software synchronization. This dataset also provides six Degrees of Freedom (DoF) ground truth poses at LiDAR frequency (10 Hz). Three data collections are described and an example use case of multi-camera visual-inertial odometry is demonstrated. This expansion dataset contains small and narrow passages, large scale open spaces, as well as vegetated areas, to test localization and mapping systems. Furthermore, some sequences present challenging situations such as abrupt lighting change, textureless surfaces, and aggressive motion. The dataset is available at: https://ori-drs.github. io/newer-college-dataset/

- **Summary**: 3D-aware image generative modeling aims to generate 3D-consistent images with explicitly controllable camera poses. Recent works have shown promising results by training neural radiance field (NeRF) generators on unstructured 2D images, but still can not generate highly-realistic images with fine details. A critical reason is that the high memory and computation cost of volumetric representation learning greatly restricts the number of point samples for radiance integration during training. Deficient sampling not only limits the expressive power of the generator to handle fine details but also impedes effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo sampling. We propose a novel approach that regulates point sampling and radiance field learning on 2D manifolds, embodied as a set of learned implicit surfaces in the 3D volume. For each viewing ray, we calculate ray-surface intersections and accumulate their radiance generated by the network. By training and rendering such radiance manifolds, our generator can produce high quality images with realistic fine details and strong visual 3D consistency.

- **Summary**: Most models tasked to ground referential utterances in 2D and 3D scenes learn to select the referred object from a pool of object proposals provided by a pre-trained detector. This is limiting because an utterance may refer to visual entities at various levels of granularity, such as the chair, the leg of the chair, or the tip of the front leg of the chair, which may be missed by the detector. We propose a language grounding model that attends on the referential utterance and on the object proposal pool computed from a pre-trained detector to decode referenced objects with a detection head, without selecting them from the pool. In this way, it is helped by powerful pre-trained object detectors without being restricted by their misses. We call our model Bottom Up Top Down DEtection TRansformers (BUTD-DETR) because it uses both language guidance (top down) and objectness guidance (bottom-up) to ground referential utterances in images and point clouds. Moreover, BUTD-DETR casts object detection as referential grounding and uses object labels as language prompts to be grounded in the visual scene, augmenting supervision for the referential grounding task in this way. The proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art across popular 3D language grounding benchmarks with significant performance gains over previous 3D approaches (12.6% on SR3D, 11.6% on NR3D and 6.3% on ScanRefer). When applied in 2D images, it performs on par with the previous state of the art. We ablate the design choices of our model and quantify their contribution to performance.

- **Summary**: Common object detection models consist of classification and regression branches, due to different task drivers, these two branches have different sensibility to the features from the same scale level and the same spatial location. The point-based prediction method, which is based on the assumption that the high classification confidence point has the high regression quality, leads to the misalignment problem. Our analysis shows, the problem is further composed of scale misalignment and spatial misalignment specifically. We aim to resolve the phenomenon at minimal cost: a minor adjustment of the head network and a new label assignment method replacing the rigid one. Our experiments show that, compared to the baseline FCOS, a one-stage and anchor-free object detection model, our model consistently get around 3 AP improvement with different backbones, demonstrating both simplicity and efficiency of our method.

- **Summary**: Estimating depth information from endoscopic images is a prerequisite for a wide set of AI-assisted technologies, such as accurate localization and measurement of tumors, or identification of non-inspected areas. As the domain specificity of colonoscopies -- deformable low-texture environments with fluids, poor lighting conditions and abrupt sensor motions -- pose challenges to multi-view 3D reconstructions, single-view depth learning stands out as a promising line of research. Depth learning can be extended in a Bayesian setting, which enables continual learning, improves decision making and can be used to compute confidence intervals or quantify uncertainty for in-body measurements. In this paper, we explore for the first time Bayesian deep networks for single-view depth estimation in colonoscopies. Our specific contribution is two-fold: 1) an exhaustive analysis of scalable Bayesian networks for depth learning in different datasets, highlighting challenges and conclusions regarding synthetic-to-real domain changes and supervised vs. self-supervised methods; and 2) a novel teacher-student approach to deep depth learning that takes into account the teacher uncertainty.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal representation learning is critical for video self-supervised representation. Recent approaches mainly use contrastive learning and pretext tasks. However, these approaches learn representation by discriminating sampled instances via feature similarity in the latent space while ignoring the intermediate state of the learned representations, which limits the overall performance. In this work, taking into account the degree of similarity of sampled instances as the intermediate state, we propose a novel pretext task - spatio-temporal overlap rate (STOR) prediction. It stems from the observation that humans are capable of discriminating the overlap rates of videos in space and time. This task encourages the model to discriminate the STOR of two generated samples to learn the representations. Moreover, we employ a joint optimization combining pretext tasks with contrastive learning to further enhance the spatio-temporal representation learning. We also study the mutual influence of each component in the proposed scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed STOR task can favor both contrastive learning and pretext tasks. The joint optimization scheme can significantly improve the spatio-temporal representation in video understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/Katou2/CSTP.

- **Summary**: The generation of well-designed artwork is often quite time-consuming and assumes a high degree of proficiency on part of the human painter. In order to facilitate the human painting process, substantial research efforts have been made on teaching machines how to "paint like a human", and then using the trained agent as a painting assistant tool for human users. However, current research in this direction is often reliant on a progressive grid-based division strategy wherein the agent divides the overall image into successively finer grids, and then proceeds to paint each of them in parallel. This inevitably leads to artificial painting sequences which are not easily intelligible to human users. To address this, we propose a novel painting approach which learns to generate output canvases while exhibiting a more human-like painting style. The proposed painting pipeline Intelli-Paint consists of 1) a progressive layering strategy which allows the agent to first paint a natural background scene representation before adding in each of the foreground objects in a progressive fashion. 2) We also introduce a novel sequential brushstroke guidance strategy which helps the painting agent to shift its attention between different image regions in a semantic-aware manner. 3) Finally, we propose a brushstroke regularization strategy which allows for ~60-80% reduction in the total number of required brushstrokes without any perceivable differences in the quality of the generated canvases. Through both quantitative and qualitative results, we show that the resulting agents not only show enhanced efficiency in output canvas generation but also exhibit a more natural-looking painting style which would better assist human users express their ideas through digital artwork.

- **Summary**: As manipulating images by copy-move, splicing and/or inpainting may lead to misinterpretation of the visual content, detecting these sorts of manipulations is crucial for media forensics. Given the variety of possible attacks on the content, devising a generic method is nontrivial. Current deep learning based methods are promising when training and test data are well aligned, but perform poorly on independent tests. Moreover, due to the absence of authentic test images, their image-level detection specificity is in doubt. The key question is how to design and train a deep neural network capable of learning generalizable features sensitive to manipulations in novel data, whilst specific to prevent false alarms on the authentic. We propose multi-view feature learning to jointly exploit tampering boundary artifacts and the noise view of the input image. As both clues are meant to be semantic-agnostic, the learned features are thus generalizable. For effectively learning from authentic images, we train with multi-scale (pixel / edge / image) supervision. We term the new network MVSS-Net and its enhanced version MVSS-Net++. Experiments are conducted in both within-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios, showing that MVSS-Net++ performs the best, and exhibits better robustness against JPEG compression, Gaussian blur and screenshot based image re-capturing.

- **Summary**: Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) aims at assigning a class label to each pixel, uniquely segmenting and identifying all object instances consistently across all frames. Classic solutions usually decompose the VPS task into several sub-tasks and utilize multiple surrogates (e.g. boxes and masks, centres and offsets) to represent objects. However, this divide-and-conquer strategy requires complex post-processing in both spatial and temporal domains and is vulnerable to failures from surrogate tasks. In this paper, inspired by object-centric learning which learns compact and robust object representations, we present Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for this task. We encode all panoptic entities in a video, including both foreground instances and background semantics, with a unified representation called panoptic slots. The coherent spatio-temporal object's information is retrieved and encoded into the panoptic slots by the proposed Video Panoptic Retriever, enabling it to localize, segment, differentiate, and associate objects in a unified manner. Finally, the output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class, mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video. We conduct extensive ablation studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, Cityscapes-VPS (\textit{val} and test sets) and VIPER (\textit{val} set), achieving new state-of-the-art performance of 63.7, 63.3 and 56.2 VPQ, respectively.

- **Summary**: Recurrent models have gained popularity in deep learning (DL) based video super-resolution (VSR), due to their increased computational efficiency, temporal receptive field and temporal consistency compared to sliding-window based models. However, when inferring on long video sequences presenting low motion (i.e. in which some parts of the scene barely move), recurrent models diverge through recurrent processing, generating high frequency artifacts. To the best of our knowledge, no study about VSR pointed out this instability problem, which can be critical for some real-world applications. Video surveillance is a typical example where such artifacts would occur, as both the camera and the scene stay static for a long time.   In this work, we expose instabilities of existing recurrent VSR networks on long sequences with low motion. We demonstrate it on a new long sequence dataset Quasi-Static Video Set, that we have created. Finally, we introduce a new framework of recurrent VSR networks that is both stable and competitive, based on Lipschitz stability theory. We propose a new recurrent VSR network, coined Middle Recurrent Video Super-Resolution (MRVSR), based on this framework. We empirically show its competitive performance on long sequences with low motion.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To develop and validate a computer tool for automatic and simultaneous segmentation of body composition depicted on computed tomography (CT) scans for the following tissues: visceral adipose (VAT), subcutaneous adipose (SAT), intermuscular adipose (IMAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and bone.   Approach: A cohort of 100 CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) was used - 50 whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)-CTs, 25 chest, and 25 abdominal. Five different body compositions were manually annotated (VAT, SAT, IMAT, SM, and bone). A training-while-annotating strategy was used for efficiency. The UNet model was trained using the already annotated cases. Then, this model was used to enable semi-automatic annotation for the remaining cases. The 10-fold cross-validation method was used to develop and validate the performance of several convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including UNet, Recurrent Residual UNet (R2Unet), and UNet++. A 3-D patch sampling operation was used when training the CNN models. The separately trained CNN models were tested to see if they could achieve a better performance than segmenting them jointly. Paired-samples t-test was used to test for statistical significance.   Results: Among the three CNN models, UNet demonstrated the best overall performance in jointly segmenting the five body compositions with a Dice coefficient of 0.840+/-0.091, 0.908+/-0.067, 0.603+/-0.084, 0.889+/-0.027, and 0.884+/-0.031, and a Jaccard index of 0.734+/-0.119, 0.837+/-0.096, 0.437+/-0.082, 0.800+/-0.042, 0.793+/-0.049, respectively for VAT, SAT, IMAT, SM, and bone.   Conclusion: There were no significant differences among the CNN models in segmenting body composition, but jointly segmenting body compositions achieved a better performance than segmenting them separately.

- **Summary**: Federated Learning is the most promising way to train robust Deep Learning models for the segmentation of Covid-19-related findings in chest CTs. By learning in a decentralized fashion, heterogeneous data can be leveraged from a variety of sources and acquisition protocols whilst ensuring patient privacy. It is, however, crucial to continuously monitor the performance of the model. Yet when it comes to the segmentation of diffuse lung lesions, a quick visual inspection is not enough to assess the quality, and thorough monitoring of all network outputs by expert radiologists is not feasible. In this work, we present an array of lightweight metrics that can be calculated locally in each hospital and then aggregated for central monitoring of a federated system. Our linear model detects over 70% of low-quality segmentations on an out-of-distribution dataset and thus reliably signals a decline in model performance.

- **Summary**: Machines that can represent and describe environmental soundscapes have practical potential, e.g., for audio tagging and captioning systems. Prevailing learning paradigms have been relying on parallel audio-text data, which is, however, scarcely available on the web. We propose VIP-ANT that induces \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{T}ext alignment without using any parallel audio-text data. Our key idea is to share the image modality between bi-modal image-text representations and bi-modal image-audio representations; the image modality functions as a pivot and connects audio and text in a tri-modal embedding space implicitly.   In a difficult zero-shot setting with no paired audio-text data, our model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the ESC50 and US8K audio classification tasks, and even surpasses the supervised state of the art for Clotho caption retrieval (with audio queries) by 2.2\% R@1. We further investigate cases of minimal audio-text supervision, finding that, e.g., just a few hundred supervised audio-text pairs increase the zero-shot audio classification accuracy by 8\% on US8K. However, to match human parity on some zero-shot tasks, our empirical scaling experiments suggest that we would need about $2^{21} \approx 2M$ supervised audio-caption pairs. Our work opens up new avenues for learning audio-text connections with little to no parallel audio-text data.

- **Summary**: Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task facilitating scene understanding and automatic driving. Most existing methods resort to classification-based Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to play as the initial pseudo labels, which tend to focus on the discriminative image regions and lack customized characteristics for the segmentation task. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel activation modulation and recalibration (AMR) scheme, which leverages a spotlight branch and a compensation branch to obtain weighted CAMs that can provide recalibration supervision and task-specific concepts. Specifically, an attention modulation module (AMM) is employed to rearrange the distribution of feature importance from the channel-spatial sequential perspective, which helps to explicitly model channel-wise interdependencies and spatial encodings to adaptively modulate segmentation-oriented activation responses. Furthermore, we introduce a cross pseudo supervision for dual branches, which can be regarded as a semantic similar regularization to mutually refine two branches. Extensive experiments show that AMR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, surpassing not only current methods trained with the image-level of supervision but also some methods relying on stronger supervision, such as saliency label. Experiments also reveal that our scheme is plug-and-play and can be incorporated with other approaches to boost their performance.

- **Summary**: Single particle imaging (SPI) at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) is particularly well suited to determine the 3D structure of particles in their native environment. For a successful reconstruction, diffraction patterns originating from a single hit must be isolated from a large number of acquired patterns. We propose to formulate this task as an image classification problem and solve it using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Two CNN configurations are developed: one that maximises the F1-score and one that emphasises high recall. We also combine the CNNs with expectation maximization (EM) selection as well as size filtering. We observed that our CNN selections have lower contrast in power spectral density functions relative to the EM selection, used in our previous work. However, the reconstruction of our CNN-based selections gives similar results. Introducing CNNs into SPI experiments allows streamlining the reconstruction pipeline, enables researchers to classify patterns on the fly, and, as a consequence, enables them to tightly control the duration of their experiments. We think that bringing non-standard artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions in a well-described SPI analysis workflow may be beneficial for the future development of the SPI experiments.

- **Summary**: Background and objectives. Domain shift is a generalisation problem of machine learning models that occurs when the data distribution of the training set is different to the data distribution encountered by the model when it is deployed. This is common in the context of biomedical image segmentation due to the variance of experimental conditions, equipment, and capturing settings. In this work, we address this challenge by studying both neural style transfer algorithms and unpaired image-to-image translation methods in the context of the segmentation of tumour spheroids.   Methods. We have illustrated the domain shift problem in the context of spheroid segmentation with 4 deep learning segmentation models that achieved an IoU over 97% when tested with images following the training distribution, but whose performance decreased up to an 84\% when applied to images captured under different conditions. In order to deal with this problem, we have explored 3 style transfer algorithms (NST, deep image analogy, and STROTSS), and 6 unpaired image-to-image translations algorithms (CycleGAN, DualGAN, ForkGAN, GANILLA, CUT, and FastCUT). These algorithms have been integrated into a high-level API that facilitates their application to other contexts where the domain-shift problem occurs.   Results. We have considerably improved the performance of the 4 segmentation models when applied to images captured under different conditions by using both style transfer and image-to-image translation algorithms. In particular, there are 2 style transfer algorithms (NST and deep image analogy) and 1 unpaired image-to-image translations algorithm (CycleGAN) that improve the IoU of the models in a range from 0.24 to 76.07. Therefore, reaching a similar performance to the one obtained with the models are applied to images following the training distribution.

- **Summary**: We introduce the first comprehensive 3D dataset for the task of unsupervised anomaly detection and localization. It is inspired by real-world visual inspection scenarios in which a model has to detect various types of defects on manufactured products, even if it is trained only on anomaly-free data. There are defects that manifest themselves as anomalies in the geometric structure of an object. These cause significant deviations in a 3D representation of the data. We employed a high-resolution industrial 3D sensor to acquire depth scans of 10 different object categories. For all object categories, we present a training and validation set, each of which solely consists of scans of anomaly-free samples. The corresponding test sets contain samples showing various defects such as scratches, dents, holes, contaminations, or deformations. Precise ground-truth annotations are provided for every anomalous test sample. An initial benchmark of 3D anomaly detection methods on our dataset indicates a considerable room for improvement.

- **Summary**: The human brain contextually exploits heterogeneous sensory information to efficiently perform cognitive tasks including vision and hearing. For example, during the cocktail party situation, the human auditory cortex contextually integrates audio-visual (AV) cues in order to better perceive speech. Recent studies have shown that AV speech enhancement (SE) models can significantly improve speech quality and intelligibility in very low signal to noise ratio (SNR) environments as compared to audio-only SE models. However, despite significant research in the area of AV SE, development of real-time processing models with low latency remains a formidable technical challenge. In this paper, we present a novel framework for low latency speaker-independent AV SE that can generalise on a range of visual and acoustic noises. In particular, a generative adversarial networks (GAN) is proposed to address the practical issue of visual imperfections in AV SE. In addition, we propose a deep neural network based real-time AV SE model that takes into account the cleaned visual speech output from GAN to deliver more robust SE. The proposed framework is evaluated on synthetic and real noisy AV corpora using objective speech quality and intelligibility metrics and subjective listing tests. Comparative simulation results show that our real time AV SE framework outperforms state-of-the-art SE approaches, including recent DNN based SE models.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel framework for solving inverse problems using NeRF-style generative models. We are interested in the problem of 3-D scene reconstruction given a single 2-D image and known camera parameters. We show that naively optimizing the latent space leads to artifacts and poor novel view rendering. We attribute this problem to volume obstructions that are clear in the 3-D geometry and become visible in the renderings of novel views. We propose a novel radiance field regularization method to obtain better 3-D surfaces and improved novel views given single view observations. Our method naturally extends to general inverse problems including inpainting where one observes only partially a single view. We experimentally evaluate our method, achieving visual improvements and performance boosts over the baselines in a wide range of tasks. Our method achieves $30-40\%$ MSE reduction and $15-25\%$ reduction in LPIPS loss compared to the previous state of the art.

- **Summary**: We present a visual localization system that learns to estimate camera poses in the real world with the help of synthetic data. Despite significant progress in recent years, most learning-based approaches to visual localization target at a single domain and require a dense database of geo-tagged images to function well. To mitigate the data scarcity issue and improve the scalability of the neural localization models, we introduce TOPO-DataGen, a versatile synthetic data generation tool that traverses smoothly between the real and virtual world, hinged on the geographic camera viewpoint. New large-scale sim-to-real benchmark datasets are proposed to showcase and evaluate the utility of the said synthetic data. Our experiments reveal that synthetic data generically enhances the neural network performance on real data. Furthermore, we introduce CrossLoc, a cross-modal visual representation learning approach to pose estimation that makes full use of the scene coordinate ground truth via self-supervision. Without any extra data, CrossLoc significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves substantially higher real-data sample efficiency. Our code and datasets are all available at https://crossloc.github.io/.

- **Summary**: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) using image-text pairs has achieved impressive results on image classification in both zero-shot and transfer learning settings. However, we show that directly applying such models to recognize image regions for object detection leads to poor performance due to a domain shift: CLIP was trained to match an image as a whole to a text description, without capturing the fine-grained alignment between image regions and text spans. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new method called RegionCLIP that significantly extends CLIP to learn region-level visual representations, thus enabling fine-grained alignment between image regions and textual concepts. Our method leverages a CLIP model to match image regions with template captions and then pretrains our model to align these region-text pairs in the feature space. When transferring our pretrained model to the open-vocabulary object detection tasks, our method significantly outperforms the state of the art by 3.8 AP50 and 2.2 AP for novel categories on COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively. Moreoever, the learned region representations support zero-shot inference for object detection, showing promising results on both COCO and LVIS datasets.

- **Summary**: Interactive object understanding, or what we can do to objects and how is a long-standing goal of computer vision. In this paper, we tackle this problem through observation of human hands in in-the-wild egocentric videos. We demonstrate that observation of what human hands interact with and how can provide both the relevant data and the necessary supervision. Attending to hands, readily localizes and stabilizes active objects for learning and reveals places where interactions with objects occur. Analyzing the hands shows what we can do to objects and how. We apply these basic principles on the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, and successfully learn state-sensitive features, and object affordances (regions of interaction and afforded grasps), purely by observing hands in egocentric videos.

- **Summary**: Object detection in high-resolution satellite imagery is emerging as a scalable alternative to on-the-ground survey data collection in many environmental and socioeconomic monitoring applications. However, performing object detection over large geographies can still be prohibitively expensive due to the high cost of purchasing imagery and compute. Inspired by traditional survey data collection strategies, we propose an approach to estimate object count statistics over large geographies through sampling. Given a cost budget, our method selects a small number of representative areas by sampling from a learnable proposal distribution. Using importance sampling, we are able to accurately estimate object counts after processing only a small fraction of the images compared to an exhaustive approach. We show empirically that the proposed framework achieves strong performance on estimating the number of buildings in the United States and Africa, cars in Kenya, brick kilns in Bangladesh, and swimming pools in the U.S., while requiring as few as 0.01% of satellite images compared to an exhaustive approach.

- **Summary**: Current methods for learning realistic and animatable 3D clothed avatars need either posed 3D scans or 2D images with carefully controlled user poses. In contrast, our goal is to learn an avatar from only 2D images of people in unconstrained poses. Given a set of images, our method estimates a detailed 3D surface from each image and then combines these into an animatable avatar. Implicit functions are well suited to the first task, as they can capture details like hair and clothes. Current methods, however, are not robust to varied human poses and often produce 3D surfaces with broken or disembodied limbs, missing details, or non-human shapes. The problem is that these methods use global feature encoders that are sensitive to global pose. To address this, we propose ICON ("Implicit Clothed humans Obtained from Normals"), which, instead, uses local features. ICON has two main modules, both of which exploit the SMPL(-X) body model. First, ICON infers detailed clothed-human normals (front/back) conditioned on the SMPL(-X) normals. Second, a visibility-aware implicit surface regressor produces an iso-surface of a human occupancy field. Importantly, at inference time, a feedback loop alternates between refining the SMPL(-X) mesh using the inferred clothed normals and then refining the normals. Given multiple reconstructed frames of a subject in varied poses, we use SCANimate to produce an animatable avatar from them. Evaluation on the AGORA and CAPE datasets shows that ICON outperforms the state of the art in reconstruction, even with heavily limited training data. Additionally, it is much more robust to out-of-distribution samples, e.g., in-the-wild poses/images and out-of-frame cropping. ICON takes a step towards robust 3D clothed human reconstruction from in-the-wild images. This enables creating avatars directly from video with personalized and natural pose-dependent cloth deformation.

- **Summary**: Decoupling spatiotemporal representation refers to decomposing the spatial and temporal features into dimension-independent factors. Although previous RGB-D-based motion recognition methods have achieved promising performance through the tightly coupled multi-modal spatiotemporal representation, they still suffer from (i) optimization difficulty under small data setting due to the tightly spatiotemporal-entangled modeling;(ii) information redundancy as it usually contains lots of marginal information that is weakly relevant to classification; and (iii) low interaction between multi-modal spatiotemporal information caused by insufficient late fusion. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose to decouple and recouple spatiotemporal representation for RGB-D-based motion recognition. Specifically, we disentangle the task of learning spatiotemporal representation into 3 sub-tasks: (1) Learning high-quality and dimension independent features through a decoupled spatial and temporal modeling network. (2) Recoupling the decoupled representation to establish stronger space-time dependency. (3) Introducing a Cross-modal Adaptive Posterior Fusion (CAPF) mechanism to capture cross-modal spatiotemporal information from RGB-D data. Seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust spatialtemporal representation and achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four public motion datasets.

- **Summary**: The advent of large-scale training has produced a cornucopia of powerful visual recognition models. However, generative models, such as GANs, have traditionally been trained from scratch in an unsupervised manner. Can the collective "knowledge" from a large bank of pretrained vision models be leveraged to improve GAN training? If so, with so many models to choose from, which one(s) should be selected, and in what manner are they most effective? We find that pretrained computer vision models can significantly improve performance when used in an ensemble of discriminators. Notably, the particular subset of selected models greatly affects performance. We propose an effective selection mechanism, by probing the linear separability between real and fake samples in pretrained model embeddings, choosing the most accurate model, and progressively adding it to the discriminator ensemble. Interestingly, our method can improve GAN training in both limited data and large-scale settings. Given only 10k training samples, our FID on LSUN Cat matches the StyleGAN2 trained on 1.6M images. On the full dataset, our method improves FID by 1.5x to 2x on cat, church, and horse categories of LSUN.

- **Summary**: Existing state-of-the-art methods for Video Object Segmentation (VOS) learn low-level pixel-to-pixel correspondences between frames to propagate object masks across video. This requires a large amount of densely annotated video data, which is costly to annotate, and largely redundant since frames within a video are highly correlated. In light of this, we propose HODOR: a novel method that tackles VOS by effectively leveraging annotated static images for understanding object appearance and scene context. We encode object instances and scene information from an image frame into robust high-level descriptors which can then be used to re-segment those objects in different frames. As a result, HODOR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks compared to existing methods trained without video annotations. Without any architectural modification, HODOR can also learn from video context around single annotated video frames by utilizing cyclic consistency, whereas other methods rely on dense, temporally consistent annotations.

- **Summary**: We present Masked Feature Prediction (MaskFeat) for self-supervised pre-training of video models. Our approach first randomly masks out a portion of the input sequence and then predicts the feature of the masked regions. We study five different types of features and find Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG), a hand-crafted feature descriptor, works particularly well in terms of both performance and efficiency. We observe that the local contrast normalization in HOG is essential for good results, which is in line with earlier work using HOG for visual recognition. Our approach can learn abundant visual knowledge and drive large-scale Transformer-based models. Without using extra model weights or supervision, MaskFeat pre-trained on unlabeled videos achieves unprecedented results of 86.7% with MViT-L on Kinetics-400, 88.3% on Kinetics-600, 80.4% on Kinetics-700, 39.8 mAP on AVA, and 75.0% on SSv2. MaskFeat further generalizes to image input, which can be interpreted as a video with a single frame and obtains competitive results on ImageNet.

- **Summary**: Face manipulation methods can be misused to affect an individual's privacy or to spread disinformation. To this end, we introduce a novel data-driven approach that produces image-specific perturbations which are embedded in the original images. The key idea is that these protected images prevent face manipulation by causing the manipulation model to produce a predefined manipulation target (uniformly colored output image in our case) instead of the actual manipulation. In addition, we propose to leverage differentiable compression approximation, hence making generated perturbations robust to common image compression. In order to prevent against multiple manipulation methods simultaneously, we further propose a novel attention-based fusion of manipulation-specific perturbations. Compared to traditional adversarial attacks that optimize noise patterns for each image individually, our generalized model only needs a single forward pass, thus running orders of magnitude faster and allowing for easy integration in image processing stacks, even on resource-constrained devices like smartphones.

- **Summary**: The lifelong learning paradigm in machine learning is an attractive alternative to the more prominent isolated learning scheme not only due to its resemblance to biological learning but also its potential to reduce energy waste by obviating excessive model re-training. A key challenge to this paradigm is the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. With the increasing popularity and success of pre-trained models in machine learning, we pose the question: What role does pre-training play in lifelong learning, specifically with respect to catastrophic forgetting? We investigate existing methods in the context of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a variety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study using a novel data set of 15 diverse NLP tasks. Across all settings, we observe that generic pre-training implicitly alleviates the effects of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially compared to randomly initialized models. We then further investigate why pre-training alleviates forgetting in this setting. We study this phenomenon by analyzing the loss landscape, finding that pre-trained weights appear to ease forgetting by leading to wider minima. Based on this insight, we propose jointly optimizing for current task loss and loss basin sharpness to explicitly encourage wider basins during sequential fine-tuning. We show that this optimization approach outperforms several state-of-the-art task-sequential continual learning algorithms across multiple settings, occasionally even without retaining a memory that scales in size with the number of tasks.

- **Summary**: This work presents a feasibility study of remote attention level estimation based on eye blink frequency. We first propose an eye blink detection system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), very competitive with respect to related works. Using this detector, we experimentally evaluate the relationship between the eye blink rate and the attention level of students captured during online sessions. The experimental framework is carried out using a public multimodal database for eye blink detection and attention level estimation called mEBAL, which comprises data from 38 students and multiples acquisition sensors, in particular, i) an electroencephalogram (EEG) band which provides the time signals coming from the student's cognitive information, and ii) RGB and NIR cameras to capture the students face gestures. The results achieved suggest an inverse correlation between the eye blink frequency and the attention level. This relation is used in our proposed method called ALEBk for estimating the attention level as the inverse of the eye blink frequency. Our results open a new research line to introduce this technology for attention level estimation on future e-learning platforms, among other applications of this kind of behavioral biometrics based on face analysis.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a task of audio-visual scene classification (SC) where input videos are classified into one of five real-life crowded scenes: 'Riot', 'Noise-Street', 'Firework-Event', 'Music-Event', and 'Sport-Atmosphere'. To this end, we firstly collect an audio-visual dataset (videos) of these five crowded contexts from Youtube (in-the-wild scenes). Then, a wide range of deep learning frameworks are proposed to deploy either audio or visual input data independently. Finally, results obtained from high-performed deep learning frameworks are fused to achieve the best accuracy score. Our experimental results indicate that audio and visual input factors independently contribute to the SC task's performance. Significantly, an ensemble of deep learning frameworks exploring either audio or visual input data can achieve the best accuracy of 95.7%.

  Knee Osteoarthritis Assessment from Plain Radiographs"
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerate joint disorder that affects a large population of elderly people worldwide. Accurate radiographic assessment of knee OA severity plays a critical role in chronic patient management. Current clinically-adopted knee OA grading systems are observer subjective and suffer from inter-rater disagreements. In this work, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis approach to provide more accurate and consistent assessments of both composite and fine-grained OA grades simultaneously. A novel semi-supervised learning method is presented to exploit the underlying coherence in the composite and fine-grained OA grades by learning from unlabeled data. By representing the grade coherence using the log-probability of a pre-trained Gaussian Mixture Model, we formulate an incoherence loss to incorporate unlabeled data in training. The proposed method also describes a keypoint-based pooling network, where deep image features are pooled from the disease-targeted keypoints (extracted along the knee joint) to provide more aligned and pathologically informative feature representations, for accurate OA grade assessments. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on the public Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) data, a multi-center ten-year observational study on 4,796 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method leads to significant improvements over previous strong whole image-based deep classification network baselines (like ResNet-50).

- **Summary**: Street-level imagery holds a significant potential to scale-up in-situ data collection. This is enabled by combining the use of cheap high quality cameras with recent advances in deep learning compute solutions to derive relevant thematic information. We present a framework to collect and extract crop type and phenological information from street level imagery using computer vision. During the 2018 growing season, high definition pictures were captured with side-looking action cameras in the Flevoland province of the Netherlands. Each month from March to October, a fixed 200-km route was surveyed collecting one picture per second resulting in a total of 400,000 geo-tagged pictures. At 220 specific parcel locations detailed on the spot crop phenology observations were recorded for 17 crop types. Furthermore, the time span included specific pre-emergence parcel stages, such as differently cultivated bare soil for spring and summer crops as well as post-harvest cultivation practices, e.g. green manuring and catch crops. Classification was done using TensorFlow with a well-known image recognition model, based on transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (MobileNet). A hypertuning methodology was developed to obtain the best performing model among 160 models. This best model was applied on an independent inference set discriminating crop type with a Macro F1 score of 88.1% and main phenological stage at 86.9% at the parcel level. Potential and caveats of the approach along with practical considerations for implementation and improvement are discussed. The proposed framework speeds up high quality in-situ data collection and suggests avenues for massive data collection via automated classification using computer vision.

- **Summary**: Convolutional networks are considered shift invariant, but it was demonstrated that their response may vary according to the exact location of the objects. In this paper we will demonstrate that most commonly investigated datasets have a bias, where objects are over-represented at the center of the image during training. This bias and the boundary condition of these networks can have a significant effect on the performance of these architectures and their accuracy drops significantly as an object approaches the boundary. We will also demonstrate how this effect can be mitigated with data augmentation techniques.

- **Summary**: Few-shot classification tasks aim to classify images in query sets based on only a few labeled examples in support sets. Most studies usually assume that each image in a task has a single and unique class association. Under these assumptions, these algorithms may not be able to identify the proper class assignment when there is no exact matching between support and query classes. For example, given a few images of lions, bikes, and apples to classify a tiger. However, in a more general setting, we could consider the higher-level concept, the large carnivores, to match the tiger to the lion for semantic classification. Existing studies rarely considered this situation due to the incompatibility of label-based supervision with complex conception relationships. In this work, we advance the few-shot learning towards this more challenging scenario, the semantic-based few-shot learning, and propose a method to address the paradigm by capturing the inner semantic relationships using interactive psychometric learning. The experiment results on the CIFAR-100 dataset show the superiority of our method for the semantic-based few-shot learning compared to the baseline.

  Most Efficient Model of the Waymo Open Dataset Challenges 2021
  (http://cvpr2021.wad.vision/)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: There have been two streams in the 3D detection from point clouds: single-stage methods and two-stage methods. While the former is more computationally efficient, the latter usually provides better detection accuracy. By carefully examining the two-stage approaches, we have found that if appropriately designed, the first stage can produce accurate box regression. In this scenario, the second stage mainly rescores the boxes such that the boxes with better localization get selected. From this observation, we have devised a single-stage anchor-free network that can fulfill these requirements. This network, named AFDetV2, extends the previous work by incorporating a self-calibrated convolution block in the backbone, a keypoint auxiliary supervision, and an IoU prediction branch in the multi-task head. As a result, the detection accuracy is drastically boosted in the single-stage. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset. We have observed that our AFDetV2 achieves the state-of-the-art results on these two datasets, superior to all the prior arts, including both the single-stage and the two-stage 3D detectors. AFDetV2 won the 1st place in the Real-Time 3D Detection of the Waymo Open Dataset Challenge 2021. In addition, a variant of our model AFDetV2-Base was entitled the "Most Efficient Model" by the Challenge Sponsor, showing a superior computational efficiency. To demonstrate the generality of this single-stage method, we have also applied it to the first stage of the two-stage networks. Without exception, the results show that with the strengthened backbone and the rescoring approach, the second stage refinement is no longer needed.

- **Summary**: Sparse representations of images are useful in many computer vision applications. Sparse coding with an $l_1$ penalty and a learned linear dictionary requires regularization of the dictionary to prevent a collapse in the $l_1$ norms of the codes. Typically, this regularization entails bounding the Euclidean norms of the dictionary's elements. In this work, we propose a novel sparse coding protocol which prevents a collapse in the codes without the need to regularize the decoder. Our method regularizes the codes directly so that each latent code component has variance greater than a fixed threshold over a set of sparse representations for a given set of inputs. Furthermore, we explore ways to effectively train sparse coding systems with multi-layer decoders since they can model more complex relationships than linear dictionaries. In our experiments with MNIST and natural image patches, we show that decoders learned with our approach have interpretable features both in the linear and multi-layer case. Moreover, we show that sparse autoencoders with multi-layer decoders trained using our variance regularization method produce higher quality reconstructions with sparser representations when compared to autoencoders with linear dictionaries. Additionally, sparse representations obtained with our variance regularization approach are useful in the downstream tasks of denoising and classification in the low-data regime.

- **Summary**: We present a deep-learning based computing framework for fast-and-accurate CT (DL-FACT) testing of COVID-19. Our CT-based DL framework was developed to improve the testing speed and accuracy of COVID-19 (plus its variants) via a DL-based approach for CT image enhancement and classification. The image enhancement network is adapted from DDnet, short for DenseNet and Deconvolution based network. To demonstrate its speed and accuracy, we evaluated DL-FACT across several sources of COVID-19 CT images. Our results show that DL-FACT can significantly shorten the turnaround time from days to minutes and improve the COVID-19 testing accuracy up to 91%. DL-FACT could be used as a software tool for medical professionals in diagnosing and monitoring COVID-19.

- **Summary**: Existing neural networks for computer vision tasks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding imperceptible perturbations to the input images can fool these methods to make a false prediction on an image that was correctly predicted without the perturbation. Various defense methods have proposed image-to-image mapping methods, either including these perturbations in the training process or removing them in a preprocessing denoising step. In doing so, existing methods often ignore that the natural RGB images in today's datasets are not captured but, in fact, recovered from RAW color filter array captures that are subject to various degradations in the capture. In this work, we exploit this RAW data distribution as an empirical prior for adversarial defense. Specifically, we proposed a model-agnostic adversarial defensive method, which maps the input RGB images to Bayer RAW space and back to output RGB using a learned camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to eliminate potential adversarial patterns. The proposed method acts as an off-the-shelf preprocessing module and, unlike model-specific adversarial training methods, does not require adversarial images to train. As a result, the method generalizes to unseen tasks without additional retraining. Experiments on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet, COCO) for different vision tasks (e.g., classification, semantic segmentation, object detection) validate that the method significantly outperforms existing methods across task domains.

- **Summary**: In the past, computer vision systems for digitized documents could rely on systematically captured, high-quality scans. Today, transactions involving digital documents are more likely to start as mobile phone photo uploads taken by non-professionals. As such, computer vision for document automation must now account for documents captured in natural scene contexts. An additional challenge is that task objectives for document processing can be highly use-case specific, which makes publicly-available datasets limited in their utility, while manual data labeling is also costly and poorly translates between use cases.   To address these issues we created Sim2Real Docs - a framework for synthesizing datasets and performing domain randomization of documents in natural scenes. Sim2Real Docs enables programmatic 3D rendering of documents using Blender, an open source tool for 3D modeling and ray-traced rendering. By using rendering that simulates physical interactions of light, geometry, camera, and background, we synthesize datasets of documents in a natural scene context. Each render is paired with use-case specific ground truth data specifying latent characteristics of interest, producing unlimited fit-for-task training data. The role of machine learning models is then to solve the inverse problem posed by the rendering pipeline. Such models can be further iterated upon with real-world data by either fine tuning or making adjustments to domain randomization parameters.

- **Summary**: Our goal is to populate digital environments, in which digital humans have diverse body shapes, move perpetually, and have plausible body-scene contact. The core challenge is to generate realistic, controllable, and infinitely long motions for diverse 3D bodies. To this end, we propose generative motion primitives via body surface markers, or GAMMA in short. In our solution, we decompose the long-term motion into a time sequence of motion primitives. We exploit body surface markers and conditional variational autoencoder to model each motion primitive, and generate long-term motion by implementing the generative model recursively. To control the motion to reach a goal, we apply a policy network to explore the generative model's latent space and use a tree-based search to preserve the motion quality during testing. Experiments show that our method can produce more realistic and controllable motion than state-of-the-art data-driven methods. With conventional path-finding algorithms, the generated human bodies can realistically move long distances for a long period of time in the scene.

- **Summary**: This paper describes our participant system for the multi-modal fact verification (Factify) challenge at AAAI 2022. Despite the recent advance in text based verification techniques and large pre-trained multimodal models cross vision and language, very limited work has been done in applying multimodal techniques to automate fact checking process, particularly considering the increasing prevalence of claims and fake news about images and videos on social media. In our work, the challenge is treated as multimodal entailment task and framed as multi-class classification. Two baseline approaches are proposed and explored including an ensemble model (combining two uni-modal models) and a multi-modal attention network (modeling the interaction between image and text pair from claim and evidence document). We conduct several experiments investigating and benchmarking different SoTA pre-trained transformers and vision models in this work. Our best model is ranked first in leaderboard which obtains a weighted average F-measure of 0.77 on both validation and test set. Exploratory analysis of dataset is also carried out on the Factify data set and uncovers salient patterns and issues (e.g., word overlapping, visual entailment correlation, source bias) that motivates our hypothesis. Finally, we highlight challenges of the task and multimodal dataset for future research.

- **Summary**: Sparse representation of real-life images is a very effective approach in imaging applications, such as denoising. In recent years, with the growth of computing power, data-driven strategies exploiting the redundancy within patches extracted from one or several images to increase sparsity have become more prominent. This paper presents a novel image denoising algorithm exploiting such an image-dependent basis inspired by the quantum many-body theory. Based on patch analysis, the similarity measures in a local image neighborhood are formalized through a term akin to interaction in quantum mechanics that can efficiently preserve the local structures of real images. The versatile nature of this adaptive basis extends the scope of its application to image-independent or image-dependent noise scenarios without any adjustment. We carry out a rigorous comparison with contemporary methods to demonstrate the denoising capability of the proposed algorithm regardless of the image characteristics, noise statistics and intensity. We illustrate the properties of the hyperparameters and their respective effects on the denoising performance, together with automated rules of selecting their values close to the optimal one in experimental setups with ground truth not available. Finally, we show the ability of our approach to deal with practical images denoising problems such as medical ultrasound image despeckling applications.

- **Summary**: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has recently achieved competitive performance across a variety of computer vision tasks. One of the motivations behind ViTs is weaker inductive biases, when compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However this also makes ViTs more difficult to train. They require very large training datasets, heavy regularization, and strong data augmentations. The data augmentation strategies used to train ViTs have largely been inherited from CNN training, despite the significant differences between the two architectures. In this work, we empirical evaluated how different data augmentation strategies performed on CNN (e.g., ResNet) versus ViT architectures for image classification. We introduced a style transfer data augmentation, termed StyleAug, which worked best for training ViTs, while RandAugment and Augmix typically worked best for training CNNs. We also found that, in addition to a classification loss, using a consistency loss between multiple augmentations of the same image was especially helpful when training ViTs.

- **Summary**: The increasing availability of satellite and aerial imagery has sparked substantial interest in automatically updating street maps by processing aerial images. Until now, the community has largely focused on road extraction, where road networks are inferred from scratch from an aerial image. However, given that relatively high-quality maps exist in most parts of the world, in practice, inference approaches must be applied to update existing maps rather than infer new ones. With recent road extraction methods showing high accuracy, we argue that it is time to transition to the more practical map update task, where an existing map is updated by adding, removing, and shifting roads, without introducing errors in parts of the existing map that remain up-to-date. In this paper, we develop a new dataset called MUNO21 for the map update task, and show that it poses several new and interesting research challenges. We evaluate several state-of-the-art road extraction methods on MUNO21, and find that substantial further improvements in accuracy will be needed to realize automatic map update.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the combination of voxel-based methods and point-based methods, and propose a novel end-to-end two-stage 3D object detector named SGNet for point clouds scenes. The voxel-based methods voxelize the scene to regular grids, which can be processed with the current advanced feature learning frameworks based on convolutional layers for semantic feature learning. Whereas the point-based methods can better extract the geometric feature of the point due to the coordinate reservations. The combination of the two is an effective solution for 3D object detection from point clouds. However, most current methods use a voxel-based detection head with anchors for final classification and localization. Although the preset anchors cover the entire scene, it is not suitable for point clouds detection tasks with larger scenes and multiple categories due to the limitation of voxel size. In this paper, we propose a voxel-to-point module (VTPM) that captures semantic and geometric features. The VTPM is a Voxel-Point-Based Module that finally implements 3D object detection in point space, which is more conducive to the detection of small-size objects and avoids the presets of anchors in inference stage. In addition, a Confidence Adjustment Module (CAM) with the center-boundary-aware confidence attention is proposed to solve the misalignment between the predicted confidence and proposals in the regions of the interest (RoI) selection. The SGNet proposed in this paper has achieved state-of-the-art results for 3D object detection in the KITTI dataset, especially in the detection of small-size objects such as cyclists. Actually, as of September 19, 2021, for KITTI dataset, SGNet ranked 1st in 3D and BEV detection on cyclists with easy difficulty level, and 2nd in the 3D detection of moderate cyclists.

- **Summary**: Recent face reenactment works are limited by the coarse reference landmarks, leading to unsatisfactory identity preserving performance due to the distribution gap between the manipulated landmarks and those sampled from a real person. To address this issue, we propose a fine-grained identity-preserving landmark-guided face reenactment approach. The proposed method has two novelties. First, a landmark synthesis network which is designed to generate fine-grained landmark faces with more details. The network refines the manipulated landmarks and generates a smooth and gradually changing face landmark sequence with good identity preserving ability. Second, several novel loss functions including synthesized face identity preserving loss, foreground/background mask loss as well as boundary loss are designed, which aims at synthesizing clear and sharp high-quality faces. Experiments are conducted on our self-collected BeautySelfie and the public VoxCeleb1 datasets. The presented qualitative and quantitative results show that our method can reenact fine-grained higher quality faces with good ID-preserved appearance details, fewer artifacts and clearer boundaries than state-of-the-art works. Code will be released for reproduction.

- **Summary**: Video creation has been an attractive yet challenging task for artists to explore. With the advancement of deep learning, recent works try to utilize deep convolutional neural networks to synthesize a video with the aid of a guiding video, and have achieved promising results. However, the acquisition of guiding videos, or other forms of guiding temporal information is costly expensive and difficult in reality. Therefore, in this work we introduce a new video synthesis task by employing two rough bad-drwan sketches only as input to create a realistic portrait video. A two-stage Sketch-to-Video model is proposed, which consists of two key novelties: 1) a feature retrieve and projection (FRP) module, which parititions the input sketch into different parts and utilizes these parts for synthesizing a realistic start or end frame and meanwhile generating rich semantic features, is designed to alleviate the sketch out-of-domain problem due to arbitrarily drawn free-form sketch styles by different users. 2) A motion projection followed by feature blending module, which projects a video (used only in training phase) into a motion space modeled by normal distribution and blends the motion variables with semantic features extracted above, is proposed to alleviate the guiding temporal information missing problem in the test phase. Experiments conducted on a combination of CelebAMask-HQ and VoxCeleb2 dataset well validate that, our method can acheive both good quantitative and qualitative results in synthesizing high-quality videos from two rough bad-drawn sketches.

- **Summary**: During the past decade, implementing reconstruction algorithms on hardware has been at the center of much attention in the field of real-time reconstruction in Compressed Sensing (CS). Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is the most widely used reconstruction algorithm on hardware implementation because OMP obtains good quality reconstruction results under a proper time cost. OMP includes Dot Product (DP) and Least Square Problem (LSP). These two parts have numerous division calculations and considerable vector-based multiplications, which limit the implementation of real-time reconstruction on hardware. In the theory of CS, besides the reconstruction algorithm, the choice of sensing matrix affects the quality of reconstruction. It also influences the reconstruction efficiency by affecting the hardware architecture. Thus, designing a real-time hardware architecture of OMP needs to take three factors into consideration. The choice of sensing matrix, the implementation of DP and LSP. In this paper, a sensing matrix, which is sparsity and contains zero vectors mainly, is adopted to optimize the OMP reconstruction to break the bottleneck of reconstruction efficiency. Based on the features of the chosen matrix, the DP and LSP are implemented by simple shift, add and comparing procedures. This work is implemented on the Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA device. To reconstruct a digital signal with 1024 length under 0.25 sampling rate, the proposal method costs 0.818us while the state-of-the-art costs 238$us. Thus, this work speedups the state-of-the-art method 290 times. This work costs 0.026s to reconstruct an 8K gray image, which achieves 30FPS real-time reconstruction.

- **Summary**: The simultaneous recognition of multiple objects in one image remains a challenging task, spanning multiple events in the recognition field such as various object scales, inconsistent appearances, and confused inter-class relationships. Recent research efforts mainly resort to the statistic label co-occurrences and linguistic word embedding to enhance the unclear semantics. Different from these researches, in this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Dual Relation learning framework, constructing complementary relationships by exploring two aspects of correlation, i.e., structural relation graph and semantic relation graph. The structural relation graph aims to capture long-range correlations from object context, by developing a cross-scale transformer-based architecture. The semantic graph dynamically models the semantic meanings of image objects with explicit semantic-aware constraints. In addition, we also incorporate the learnt structural relationship into the semantic graph, constructing a joint relation graph for robust representations. With the collaborative learning of these two effective relation graphs, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art on two popular multi-label recognition benchmarks, i.e., MS-COCO and VOC 2007 dataset.

- **Summary**: The rapid development in visual crowd analysis shows a trend to count people by positioning or even detecting, rather than simply summing a density map. It also enlightens us back to the essence of the field, detection to count, which can give more abundant crowd information and has more practical applications. However, some recent work on crowd localization and detection has two limitations: 1) The typical detection methods can not handle the dense crowds and a large variation in scale; 2) The density map heuristic methods suffer from performance deficiency in position and box prediction, especially in high density or large-size crowds. In this paper, we devise a tailored baseline for dense crowds location, detection, and counting from a new perspective, named as LDC-Net for convenience, which has the following features: 1) A strong but minimalist paradigm to detect objects by only predicting a location map and a size map, which endows an ability to detect in a scene with any capacity ($0 \sim 10,000+$ persons); 2) Excellent cross-scale ability in facing a large variation, such as the head ranging in $0 \sim 100,000+$ pixels; 3) Achieve superior performance in location and box prediction tasks, as well as a competitive counting performance compared with the density-based methods. Finally, the source code and pre-trained models will be released.

- **Summary**: Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a popular one-shot paradigm for NAS due to its high efficiency. It introduces trainable architecture parameters to represent the importance of candidate operations and proposes first/second-order approximation to estimate their gradients, making it possible to solve NAS by gradient descent algorithm. However, our in-depth empirical results show that the approximation will often distort the loss landscape, leading to the biased objective to optimize and in turn inaccurate gradient estimation for architecture parameters. This work turns to zero-order optimization and proposes a novel NAS scheme, called ZARTS, to search without enforcing the above approximation. Specifically, three representative zero-order optimization methods are introduced: RS, MGS, and GLD, among which MGS performs best by balancing the accuracy and speed. Moreover, we explore the connections between RS/MGS and gradient descent algorithm and show that our ZARTS can be seen as a robust gradient-free counterpart to DARTS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and search spaces show the remarkable performance of our method. In particular, results on 12 benchmarks verify the outstanding robustness of ZARTS, where the performance of DARTS collapses due to its known instability issue. Also, we search on the search space of DARTS to compare with peer methods, and our discovered architecture achieves 97.54% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 75.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which are state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: The lack of large-scale real raw image denoising dataset gives rise to challenges on synthesizing realistic raw image noise for training denoising models. However, the real raw image noise is contributed by many noise sources and varies greatly among different sensors. Existing methods are unable to model all noise sources accurately, and building a noise model for each sensor is also laborious. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective to synthesize noise by directly sampling from the sensor's real noise. It inherently generates accurate raw image noise for different camera sensors. Two efficient and generic techniques: pattern-aligned patch sampling and high-bit reconstruction help accurate synthesis of spatial-correlated noise and high-bit noise respectively. We conduct systematic experiments on SIDD and ELD datasets. The results show that (1) our method outperforms existing methods and demonstrates wide generalization on different sensors and lighting conditions. (2) Recent conclusions derived from DNN-based noise modeling methods are actually based on inaccurate noise parameters. The DNN-based methods still cannot outperform physics-based statistical methods.

- **Summary**: Generative diffusion processes are an emerging and effective tool for image and speech generation. In the existing methods, the underlying noise distribution of the diffusion process is Gaussian noise. However, fitting distributions with more degrees of freedom could improve the performance of such generative models. In this work, we investigate other types of noise distribution for the diffusion process. Specifically, we introduce the Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model (DDGM) and show that noise from Gamma distribution provides improved results for image and speech generation. Our approach preserves the ability to efficiently sample state in the training diffusion process while using Gamma noise.

- **Summary**: Many methods have been proposed over the years to tackle the task of facial 3D geometry and texture recovery from a single image. Such methods often fail to provide high-fidelity texture without relying on 3D facial scans during training. In contrast, the complementary task of 3D facial generation has not received as much attention. As opposed to the 2D texture domain, where GANs have proven to produce highly realistic facial images, the more challenging 3D geometry domain has not yet caught up to the same levels of realism and diversity.   In this paper, we propose a novel unified pipeline for both tasks, generation of both geometry and texture, and recovery of high-fidelity texture. Our texture model is learned, in an unsupervised fashion, from natural images as opposed to scanned texture maps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such unified framework independent of scanned textures.   Our novel training pipeline incorporates a pre-trained 2D facial generator coupled with a deep feature manipulation methodology. By applying precise 3DMM fitting, we can seamlessly integrate our modeled textures into synthetically generated background images forming a realistic composition of our textured model with background, hair, teeth, and body. This enables us to apply transfer learning from the domain of 2D image generation, thus, benefiting greatly from the impressive results obtained in this domain.   We provide a comprehensive study on several recent methods comparing our model in generation and reconstruction tasks. As the extensive qualitative, as well as quantitative analysis, demonstrate, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both tasks.

- **Summary**: In recent years, with the increasing demand for public safety and the rapid development of intelligent surveillance networks, person re-identification (Re-ID) has become one of the hot research topics in the computer vision field. The main research goal of person Re-ID is to retrieve persons with the same identity from different cameras. However, traditional person Re-ID methods require manual marking of person targets, which consumes a lot of labor cost. With the widespread application of deep neural networks, many deep learning-based person Re-ID methods have emerged. Therefore, this paper is to facilitate researchers to understand the latest research results and the future trends in the field. Firstly, we summarize the studies of several recently published person Re-ID surveys and complement the latest research methods to systematically classify deep learning-based person Re-ID methods. Secondly, we propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy that classifies current deep learning-based person Re-ID methods into four categories according to metric and representation learning, including methods for deep metric learning, local feature learning, generative adversarial learning and sequence feature learning. Furthermore, we subdivide the above four categories according to their methodologies and motivations, discussing the advantages and limitations of part subcategories. Finally, we discuss some challenges and possible research directions for person Re-ID.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised visual representation learning has gained much attention from the computer vision community because of the recent achievement of contrastive learning. Most of the existing contrastive learning frameworks adopt the instance discrimination as the pretext task, which treating every single instance as a different class. However, such method will inevitably cause class collision problems, which hurts the quality of the learned representation. Motivated by this observation, we introduced a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework (WCL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, our proposed framework is based on two projection heads, one of which will perform the regular instance discrimination task. The other head will use a graph-based method to explore similar samples and generate a weak label, then perform a supervised contrastive learning task based on the weak label to pull the similar images closer. We further introduced a K-Nearest Neighbor based multi-crop strategy to expand the number of positive samples. Extensive experimental results demonstrate WCL improves the quality of self-supervised representations across different datasets. Notably, we get a new state-of-the-art result for semi-supervised learning. With only 1\% and 10\% labeled examples, WCL achieves 65\% and 72\% ImageNet Top-1 Accuracy using ResNet50, which is even higher than SimCLRv2 with ResNet101.

- **Summary**: Fully-supervised CNN-based approaches for learning local image descriptors have shown remarkable results in a wide range of geometric tasks. However, most of them require per-pixel ground-truth keypoint correspondence data which is difficult to acquire at scale. To address this challenge, recent weakly- and self-supervised methods can learn feature descriptors from relative camera poses or using only synthetic rigid transformations such as homographies. In this work, we focus on understanding the limitations of existing self-supervised approaches and propose a set of improvements that combined lead to powerful feature descriptors. We show that increasing the search space from in-pair to in-batch for hard negative mining brings consistent improvement. To enhance the discriminativeness of feature descriptors, we propose a coarse-to-fine method for mining local hard negatives from a wider search space by using global visual image descriptors. We demonstrate that a combination of synthetic homography transformation, color augmentation, and photorealistic image stylization produces useful representations that are viewpoint and illumination invariant. The feature descriptors learned by the proposed approach perform competitively and surpass their fully- and weakly-supervised counterparts on various geometric benchmarks such as image-based localization, sparse feature matching, and image retrieval.



### 6D-ViT: Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation via Transformer-based Instance Representation Learning

- **Summary**: This paper presents 6D-ViT, a transformer-based instance representation learning network, which is suitable for highly accurate category-level object pose estimation on RGB-D images. Specifically, a novel two-stream encoder-decoder framework is dedicated to exploring complex and powerful instance representations from RGB images, point clouds and categorical shape priors. For this purpose, the whole framework consists of two main branches, named Pixelformer and Pointformer. The Pixelformer contains a pyramid transformer encoder with an all-MLP decoder to extract pixelwise appearance representations from RGB images, while the Pointformer relies on a cascaded transformer encoder and an all-MLP decoder to acquire the pointwise geometric characteristics from point clouds. Then, dense instance representations (i.e., correspondence matrix, deformation field) are obtained from a multi-source aggregation network with shape priors, appearance and geometric information as input. Finally, the instance 6D pose is computed by leveraging the correspondence among dense representations, shape priors, and the instance point clouds. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed 3D instance representation learning framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, and significantly outperforms all existing methods.

- **Summary**: We present a conditional estimation (CEST) framework to learn 3D facial parameters from 2D single-view images by self-supervised training from videos. CEST is based on the process of analysis by synthesis, where the 3D facial parameters (shape, reflectance, viewpoint, and illumination) are estimated from the face image, and then recombined to reconstruct the 2D face image. In order to learn semantically meaningful 3D facial parameters without explicit access to their labels, CEST couples the estimation of different 3D facial parameters by taking their statistical dependency into account. Specifically, the estimation of any 3D facial parameter is not only conditioned on the given image, but also on the facial parameters that have already been derived. Moreover, the reflectance symmetry and consistency among the video frames are adopted to improve the disentanglement of facial parameters. Together with a novel strategy for incorporating the reflectance symmetry and consistency, CEST can be efficiently trained with in-the-wild video clips. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CEST.

- **Summary**: The usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the context of structural health inspection is recently gaining tremendous popularity. Camera mounted UAVs enable the fast acquisition of a large number of images often used for mapping, 3D model reconstruction, and as an assisting tool for inspectors. Due to the number of images captured during large scale UAV surveys, a manual image-based inspection analysis of entire assets cannot be efficiently performed by qualified engineers. Additionally, comparing defects to past inspections requires the retrieval of relevant images which is often impractical without extensive metadata or computer-vision-based algorithms.   In this paper, we propose an end-to-end method for automated structural inspection damage analysis. Using automated object detection and segmentation we accurately localize defects, bridge utilities and elements. Next, given the high overlap in UAV imagery, points of interest are extracted, and defects are located and matched throughout the image database, considerably reducing data redundancy while maintaining a detailed record of the defects.   Our technique not only enables fast and robust damage analysis of UAV imagery, as we show herein, but is also effective for analyzing manually acquired images.

- **Summary**: With the goal of directly generalizing trained model to unseen target domains, domain generalization (DG), a newly proposed learning paradigm, has attracted considerable attention. Previous DG models usually require a sufficient quantity of annotated samples from observed source domains during training. In this paper, we relax this requirement about full annotation and investigate semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) where only one source domain is fully annotated along with the other domains totally unlabeled in the training process. With the challenges of tackling the domain gap between observed source domains and predicting unseen target domains, we propose a novel deep framework via joint domain-aware labels and dual-classifier to produce high-quality pseudo-labels. Concretely, to predict accurate pseudo-labels under domain shift, a domain-aware pseudo-labeling module is developed. Also, considering inconsistent goals between generalization and pseudo-labeling: former prevents overfitting on all source domains while latter might overfit the unlabeled source domains for high accuracy, we employ a dual-classifier to independently perform pseudo-labeling and domain generalization in the training process. When accurate pseudo-labels are generated for unlabeled source domains, the domain mixup operation is applied to augment new domains between labeled and unlabeled domains, which is beneficial for boosting the generalization capability of the model. Extensive results on publicly available DG benchmark datasets show the efficacy of our proposed SSDG method.

- **Summary**: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used in a variety of applications, and can be seen as an unstructured version of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). As in CNNs, the computational cost of GCNs for large input graphs (such as large point clouds or meshes) can be high and inhibit the use of these networks, especially in environments with low computational resources. To ease these costs, quantization can be applied to GCNs. However, aggressive quantization of the feature maps can lead to a significant degradation in performance. On a different note, Haar wavelet transforms are known to be one of the most effective and efficient approaches to compress signals. Therefore, instead of applying aggressive quantization to feature maps, we propose to utilize Haar wavelet compression and light quantization to reduce the computations and the bandwidth involved with the network. We demonstrate that this approach surpasses aggressive feature quantization by a significant margin, for a variety of problems ranging from node classification to point cloud classification and part and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: 3D gaze estimation is about predicting the line of sight of a person in 3D space. Person-independent models for the same lack precision due to anatomical differences of subjects, whereas person-specific calibrated techniques add strict constraints on scalability. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel technique, Facial Landmark Heatmap Activated Multimodal Gaze Estimation (FLAME), as a way of combining eye anatomical information using eye landmark heatmaps to obtain precise gaze estimation without any person-specific calibration. Our evaluation demonstrates a competitive performance of about 10% improvement on benchmark datasets ColumbiaGaze and EYEDIAP. We also conduct an ablation study to validate our method.

  of raster manga by deep reinforcement learning
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Manga is a fashionable Japanese-style comic form that is composed of black-and-white strokes and is generally displayed as raster images on digital devices. Typical mangas have simple textures, wide lines, and few color gradients, which are vectorizable natures to enjoy the merits of vector graphics, e.g., adaptive resolutions and small file sizes. In this paper, we propose MARVEL (MAnga's Raster to VEctor Learning), a primitive-wise approach for vectorizing raster mangas by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Unlike previous learning-based methods which predict vector parameters for an entire image, MARVEL introduces a new perspective that regards an entire manga as a collection of basic primitives\textemdash stroke lines, and designs a DRL model to decompose the target image into a primitive sequence for achieving accurate vectorization. To improve vectorization accuracies and decrease file sizes, we further propose a stroke accuracy reward to predict accurate stroke lines, and a pruning mechanism to avoid generating erroneous and repeated strokes. Extensive subjective and objective experiments show that our MARVEL can generate impressive results and reaches the state-of-the-art level.

- **Summary**: Recent face generation methods have tried to synthesize faces based on the given contour condition, like a low-resolution image or sketch. However, the problem of identity ambiguity remains unsolved, which usually occurs when the contour is too vague to provide reliable identity information (e.g., when its resolution is extremely low). Thus feasible solutions of image restoration could be infinite. In this work, we propose a novel framework that takes the contour and an extra image specifying the identity as the inputs, where the contour can be of various modalities, including the low-resolution image, sketch, and semantic label map. Concretely, we propose a novel dual-encoder architecture, in which an identity encoder extracts the identity-related feature, accompanied by a main encoder to obtain the rough contour information and further fuse all the information together. The encoder output is iteratively fed into a pre-trained StyleGAN generator until getting a satisfying result. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves identity-guided face generation conditioned on multi-modal contour images. Moreover, our method can produce photo-realistic results with 1024$\times$1024 resolution.

- **Summary**: Transformers yield state-of-the-art results across many tasks. However, their heuristically designed architecture impose huge computational costs during inference. This work aims on challenging the common design philosophy of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with uniform dimension across all the stacked blocks in a model stage, where we redistribute the parameters both across transformer blocks and between different structures within the block via the first systematic attempt on global structural pruning. Dealing with diverse ViT structural components, we derive a novel Hessian-based structural pruning criteria comparable across all layers and structures, with latency-aware regularization for direct latency reduction. Performing iterative pruning on the DeiT-Base model leads to a new architecture family called NViT (Novel ViT), with a novel parameter redistribution that utilizes parameters more efficiently. On ImageNet-1K, NViT-Base achieves a 2.6x FLOPs reduction, 5.1x parameter reduction, and 1.9x run-time speedup over the DeiT-Base model in a near lossless manner. Smaller NViT variants achieve more than 1% accuracy gain at the same throughput of the DeiT Small/Tiny variants, as well as a lossless 3.3x parameter reduction over the SWIN-Small model. These results outperform prior art by a large margin. Further analysis is provided on the parameter redistribution insight of NViT, where we show the high prunability of ViT models, distinct sensitivity within ViT block, and unique parameter distribution trend across stacked ViT blocks. Our insights provide viability for a simple yet effective parameter redistribution rule towards more efficient ViTs for off-the-shelf performance boost.

- **Summary**: Inspection of tissues using a light microscope is the primary method of diagnosing many diseases, notably cancer. Highly multiplexed tissue imaging builds on this foundation, enabling the collection of up to 60 channels of molecular information plus cell and tissue morphology using antibody staining. This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with the design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10^9 or more pixels per channel, containing millions of cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing ROIs in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope2screen metaphor, we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.

- **Summary**: In digital pathology, both detection and classification of cells are important for automatic diagnostic and prognostic tasks. Classifying cells into subtypes, such as tumor cells, lymphocytes or stromal cells is particularly challenging. Existing methods focus on morphological appearance of individual cells, whereas in practice pathologists often infer cell classes through their spatial context. In this paper, we propose a novel method for both detection and classification that explicitly incorporates spatial contextual information. We use the spatial statistical function to describe local density in both a multi-class and a multi-scale manner. Through representation learning and deep clustering techniques, we learn advanced cell representation with both appearance and spatial context. On various benchmarks, our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-arts, especially on the classification task. We also create a new dataset for multi-class cell detection and classification in breast cancer and we make both our code and data publicly available.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data is a powerful tool in training data hungry deep learning algorithms. However, to date, camera-based physiological sensing has not taken full advantage of these techniques. In this work, we leverage a high-fidelity synthetics pipeline for generating videos of faces with faithful blood flow and breathing patterns. We present systematic experiments showing how physiologically-grounded synthetic data can be used in training camera-based multi-parameter cardiopulmonary sensing. We provide empirical evidence that heart and breathing rate measurement accuracy increases with the number of synthetic avatars in the training set. Furthermore, training with avatars with darker skin types leads to better overall performance than training with avatars with lighter skin types. Finally, we discuss the opportunities that synthetics present in the domain of camera-based physiological sensing and limitations that need to be overcome.

- **Summary**: Recent RGBD-based models for saliency detection have attracted research attention. The depth clues such as boundary clues, surface normal, shape attribute, etc., contribute to the identification of salient objects with complicated scenarios. However, most RGBD networks require multi-modalities from the input side and feed them separately through a two-stream design, which inevitably results in extra costs on depth sensors and computation. To tackle these inconveniences, we present in this paper a novel fusion design named modality-guided subnetwork (MGSnet). It has the following superior designs: 1) Our model works for both RGB and RGBD data, and dynamically estimating depth if not available. Taking the inner workings of depth-prediction networks into account, we propose to estimate the pseudo-geometry maps from RGB input - essentially mimicking the multi-modality input. 2) Our MGSnet for RGB SOD results in real-time inference but achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other RGB models. 3) The flexible and lightweight design of MGS facilitates the integration into RGBD two-streaming models. The introduced fusion design enables a cross-modality interaction to enable further progress but with a minimal cost.

- **Summary**: The recent advancement in deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has brought insight into the automation of X-ray security screening for aviation security and beyond. Here, we explore the viability of two recent end-to-end object detection CNN architectures, Cascade R-CNN and FreeAnchor, for prohibited item detection by balancing processing time and the impact of image data compression from an operational viewpoint. Overall, we achieve maximal detection performance using a FreeAnchor architecture with a ResNet50 backbone, obtaining mean Average Precision (mAP) of 87.7 and 85.8 for using the OPIXray and SIXray benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over prior work on both. With fewer parameters and less training time, FreeAnchor achieves the highest detection inference speed of ~13 fps (3.9 ms per image). Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of lossy image compression upon detector performance. The CNN models display substantial resilience to the lossy compression, resulting in only a 1.1% decrease in mAP at the JPEG compression level of 50. Additionally, a thorough evaluation of data augmentation techniques is provided, including adaptions of MixUp and CutMix strategy as well as other standard transformations, further improving the detection accuracy.

- **Summary**: Many emerging applications of intelligent robots need to explore and understand new environments, where it is desirable to detect objects of novel classes on the fly with minimum online efforts. This is an object detection on demand (ODOD) task. It is challenging, because it is impossible to annotate a large number of data on the fly, and the embedded systems are usually unable to perform back-propagation which is essential for training. Most existing few-shot detection methods are confronted here as they need extra training. We propose a novel morphable detector (MD), that simply "morphs" some of its changeable parameters online estimated from the few samples, so as to detect novel classes without any extra training. The MD has two sets of parameters, one for the feature embedding and the other for class representation (called "prototypes"). Each class is associated with a hidden prototype to be learned by integrating the visual and semantic embeddings. The learning of the MD is based on the alternate learning of the feature embedding and the prototypes in an EM-like approach which allows the recovery of an unknown prototype from a few samples of a novel class. Once an MD is learned, it is able to use a few samples of a novel class to directly compute its prototype to fulfill the online morphing process. We have shown the superiority of the MD in Pascal, COCO and FSOD datasets. The code is available https://github.com/Zhaoxiangyun/Morphable-Detector.

- **Summary**: This work demonstrates a multi-lens microscopic imaging system that overlaps multiple independent fields of view on a single sensor for high-efficiency automated specimen analysis. Automatic detection, classification and counting of various morphological features of interest is now a crucial component of both biomedical research and disease diagnosis. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dramatically improved the accuracy of counting cells and sub-cellular features from acquired digital image data, the overall throughput is still typically hindered by the limited space-bandwidth product (SBP) of conventional microscopes. Here, we show both in simulation and experiment that overlapped imaging and co-designed analysis software can achieve accurate detection of diagnostically-relevant features for several applications, including counting of white blood cells and the malaria parasite, leading to multi-fold increase in detection and processing throughput with minimal reduction in accuracy.

- **Summary**: Social distancing, an essential public health measure to limit the spread of contagious diseases, has gained significant attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, the problem of visual social distancing compliance assessment in busy public areas, with wide field-of-view cameras, is considered. A dataset of crowd scenes with people annotations under a bird's eye view (BEV) and ground truth for metric distances is introduced, and several measures for the evaluation of social distance detection systems are proposed. A multi-branch network, BEV-Net, is proposed to localize individuals in world coordinates and identify high-risk regions where social distancing is violated. BEV-Net combines detection of head and feet locations, camera pose estimation, a differentiable homography module to map image into BEV coordinates, and geometric reasoning to produce a BEV map of the people locations in the scene. Experiments on complex crowded scenes demonstrate the power of the approach and show superior performance over baselines derived from methods in the literature. Applications of interest for public health decision makers are finally discussed. Datasets, code and pretrained models are publicly available at GitHub.

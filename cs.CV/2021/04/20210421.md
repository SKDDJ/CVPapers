- **Summary**: Central to the application of many multi-view geometry algorithms is the extraction of matching points between multiple viewpoints, enabling classical tasks such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Many approaches that characterize these points have been proposed based on hand-tuned appearance models or data-driven learning methods. We propose Soft Expectation and Deep Maximization (SEDM), an iterative unsupervised learning process that directly optimizes the repeatability of the features by posing the problem in a similar way to expectation maximization (EM). We found convergence to be reliable and the new model to be more lighting invariant and better at localize the underlying 3D points in a scene, improving SfM quality when compared to other state of the art deep learning detectors.

- **Summary**: This work focuses on the analysis that whether 3D face models can be learned from only the speech inputs of speakers. Previous works for cross-modal face synthesis study image generation from voices. However, image synthesis includes variations such as hairstyles, backgrounds, and facial textures, that are arguably irrelevant to voice or without direct studies to show correlations. We instead investigate the ability to reconstruct 3D faces to concentrate on only geometry, which is more physiologically grounded. We propose both the supervised learning and unsupervised learning frameworks. Especially we demonstrate how unsupervised learning is possible in the absence of a direct voice-to-3D-face dataset under limited availability of 3D face scans when the model is equipped with knowledge distillation. To evaluate the performance, we also propose several metrics to measure the geometric fitness of two 3D faces based on points, lines, and regions. We find that 3D face shapes can be reconstructed from voices. Experimental results suggest that 3D faces can be reconstructed from voices, and our method can improve the performance over the baseline. The best performance gains (15% - 20%) on ear-to-ear distance ratio metric (ER) coincides with the intuition that one can roughly envision whether a speaker's face is overall wider or thinner only from a person's voice.

- **Summary**: Optimized for pixel fidelity metrics, images compressed by existing image codec are facing systematic challenges when used for visual analysis tasks, especially under low-bitrate coding. This paper proposes a visual analysis-motivated rate-distortion model for Versatile Video Coding (VVC) intra compression. The proposed model has two major contributions, a novel rate allocation strategy and a new distortion measurement model. We first propose the region of interest for machine (ROIM) to evaluate the degree of importance for each coding tree unit (CTU) in visual analysis. Then, a novel CTU-level bit allocation model is proposed based on ROIM and the local texture characteristics of each CTU. After an in-depth analysis of multiple distortion models, a visual analysis friendly distortion criteria is subsequently proposed by extracting deep feature of each coding unit (CU). To alleviate the problem of lacking spatial context information when calculating the distortion of each CU, we finally propose a multi-scale feature distortion (MSFD) metric using different neighboring pixels by weighting the extracted deep features in each scale. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme could achieve up to 28.17\% bitrate saving under the same analysis performance among several typical visual analysis tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Deep CNNs have achieved significant successes in image processing and its applications, including single image super-resolution (SR). However, conventional methods still resort to some predetermined integer scaling factors, e.g., x2 or x4. Thus, they are difficult to be applied when arbitrary target resolutions are required. Recent approaches extend the scope to real-valued upsampling factors, even with varying aspect ratios to handle the limitation. In this paper, we propose the SRWarp framework to further generalize the SR tasks toward an arbitrary image transformation. We interpret the traditional image warping task, specifically when the input is enlarged, as a spatially-varying SR problem. We also propose several novel formulations, including the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending, to reconstruct visually favorable results in the transformation process. Compared with previous methods, we do not constrain the SR model on a regular grid but allow numerous possible deformations for flexible and diverse image editing. Extensive experiments and ablation studies justify the necessity and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed SRWarp method under various transformations.

- **Summary**: Instance level detection and segmentation of thoracic diseases or abnormalities are crucial for automatic diagnosis in chest X-ray images. Leveraging on constant structure and disease relations extracted from domain knowledge, we propose a structure-aware relation network (SAR-Net) extending Mask R-CNN. The SAR-Net consists of three relation modules: 1. the anatomical structure relation module encoding spatial relations between diseases and anatomical parts. 2. the contextual relation module aggregating clues based on query-key pair of disease RoI and lung fields. 3. the disease relation module propagating co-occurrence and causal relations into disease proposals. Towards making a practical system, we also provide ChestX-Det, a chest X-Ray dataset with instance-level annotations (boxes and masks). ChestX-Det is a subset of the public dataset NIH ChestX-ray14. It contains ~3500 images of 13 common disease categories labeled by three board-certified radiologists. We evaluate our SAR-Net on it and another dataset DR-Private. Experimental results show that it can enhance the strong baseline of Mask R-CNN with significant improvements. The ChestX-Det is released at https://github.com/Deepwise-AILab/ChestX-Det-Dataset.

- **Summary**: Based on its great successes in inference and denosing tasks, Dictionary Learning (DL) and its related sparse optimization formulations have garnered a lot of research interest. While most solutions have focused on single layer dictionaries, the recently improved Deep DL methods have also fallen short on a number of issues. We hence propose a novel Deep DL approach where each DL layer can be formulated and solved as a combination of one linear layer and a Recurrent Neural Network, where the RNN is flexibly regraded as a layer-associated learned metric. Our proposed work unveils new insights between the Neural Networks and Deep DL, and provides a novel, efficient and competitive approach to jointly learn the deep transforms and metrics. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method can not only outperform existing Deep DL, but also state-of-the-art generic Convolutional Neural Networks.



### BADet: Boundary-Aware 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds

- **Summary**: Currently, existing state-of-the-art 3D object detectors are in two-stage paradigm. These methods typically comprise two steps: 1) Utilize a region proposal network to propose a handful of high-quality proposals in a bottom-up fashion. 2) Resize and pool the semantic features from the proposed regions to summarize RoI-wise representations for further refinement. Note that these RoI-wise representations in step 2) are considered individually as uncorrelated entries when fed to following detection headers. Nevertheless, we observe these proposals generated by step 1) offset from ground truth somehow, emerging in local neighborhood densely with an underlying probability. Challenges arise in the case where a proposal largely forsakes its boundary information due to coordinate offset while existing networks lack corresponding information compensation mechanism. In this paper, we propose $BADet$ for 3D object detection from point clouds. Specifically, instead of refining each proposal independently as previous works do, we represent each proposal as a node for graph construction within a given cut-off threshold, associating proposals in the form of local neighborhood graph, with boundary correlations of an object being explicitly exploited. Besides, we devise a lightweight Region Feature Aggregation Module to fully exploit voxel-wise, pixel-wise, and point-wise features with expanding receptive fields for more informative RoI-wise representations. We validate BADet both on widely used KITTI Dataset and highly challenging nuScenes Dataset. As of Apr. 17th, 2021, our BADet achieves on par performance on KITTI 3D detection leaderboard and ranks $1^{st}$ on $Moderate$ difficulty of $Car$ category on KITTI BEV detection leaderboard.

- **Summary**: Image composition targets at inserting a foreground object into a background image. Most previous image composition methods focus on adjusting the foreground to make it compatible with background while ignoring the shadow effect of foreground on the background. In this work, we focus on generating plausible shadow for the foreground object in the composite image. First, we contribute a real-world shadow generation dataset DESOBA by generating synthetic composite images based on paired real images and deshadowed images. Then, we propose a novel shadow generation network SGRNet, which consists of a shadow mask prediction stage and a shadow filling stage. In the shadow mask prediction stage, foreground and background information are thoroughly interacted to generate foreground shadow mask. In the shadow filling stage, shadow parameters are predicted to fill the shadow area. Extensive experiments on our DESOBA dataset and real composite images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/bcmi/Object-Shadow-Generation-Dataset-DESOBA.

- **Summary**: This work introduces a novel solution to measure economic activity through remote sensing for a wide range of spatial areas. We hypothesized that disturbances in human behavior caused by major life-changing events leave signatures in satellite imagery that allows devising relevant image-based indicators to estimate their impacts and support decision-makers. We present a case study for the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, which imposed severe mobility restrictions and caused worldwide disruptions, using flying airplane detection around the 30 busiest airports in Europe to quantify and analyze the lockdown's effects and post-lockdown recovery. Our solution won the Rapid Action Coronavirus Earth observation (RACE) upscaling challenge, sponsored by the European Space Agency and the European Commission, and now integrates the RACE dashboard. This platform combines satellite data and artificial intelligence to promote a progressive and safe reopening of essential activities.

- **Summary**: A standard model for image reconstruction involves the minimization of a data-fidelity term along with a regularizer, where the optimization is performed using proximal algorithms such as ISTA and ADMM. In plug-and-play (PnP) regularization, the proximal operator (associated with the regularizer) in ISTA and ADMM is replaced by a powerful image denoiser. Although PnP regularization works surprisingly well in practice, its theoretical convergence -- whether convergence of the PnP iterates is guaranteed and if they minimize some objective function -- is not completely understood even for simple linear denoisers such as nonlocal means. In particular, while there are works where either iterate or objective convergence is established separately, a simultaneous guarantee on iterate and objective convergence is not available for any denoiser to our knowledge. In this paper, we establish both forms of convergence for a special class of linear denoisers. Notably, unlike existing works where the focus is on symmetric denoisers, our analysis covers non-symmetric denoisers such as nonlocal means and almost any convex data-fidelity. The novelty in this regard is that we make use of the convergence theory of averaged operators and we work with a special inner product (and norm) derived from the linear denoiser; the latter requires us to appropriately define the gradient and proximal operators associated with the data-fidelity term. We validate our convergence results using image reconstruction experiments.

- **Summary**: The recent emerged weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods can learn to localize an object in the image only using image-level labels. Previous works endeavor to perceive the interval objects from the small and sparse discriminative attention map, yet ignoring the co-occurrence confounder (e.g., bird and sky), which makes the model inspection (e.g., CAM) hard to distinguish between the object and context. In this paper, we make an early attempt to tackle this challenge via causal intervention (CI). Our proposed method, dubbed CI-CAM, explores the causalities among images, contexts, and categories to eliminate the biased co-occurrence in the class activation maps thus improving the accuracy of object localization. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CI-CAM in learning the clear object boundaries from confounding contexts. Particularly, in CUB-200-2011 which severely suffers from the co-occurrence confounder, CI-CAM significantly outperforms the traditional CAM-based baseline (58.39% vs 52.4% in top-1 localization accuracy). While in more general scenarios such as ImageNet, CI-CAM can also perform on par with the state of the arts.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning aims to recognize unseen objects using their semantic representations. Most existing works use visual attributes labeled by humans, not suitable for large-scale applications. In this paper, we revisit the use of documents as semantic representations. We argue that documents like Wikipedia pages contain rich visual information, which however can easily be buried by the vast amount of non-visual sentences. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automatic mechanism for visual sentence extraction that leverages the document section headers and the clustering structure of visual sentences. The extracted visual sentences, after a novel weighting scheme to distinguish similar classes, essentially form semantic representations like visual attributes but need much less human effort. On the ImageNet dataset with over 10,000 unseen classes, our representations lead to a 64% relative improvement against the commonly used ones.



### Improvement of Normal Estimation for PointClouds via Simplifying Surface Fitting

- **Summary**: With the burst development of neural networks in recent years, the task of normal estimation has once again become a concern. By introducing the neural networks to classic methods based on problem-specific knowledge, the adaptability of the normal estimation algorithm to noise and scale has been greatly improved. However, the compatibility between neural networks and the traditional methods has not been considered. Similar to the principle of Occam's razor, that is, the simpler is better. We observe that a more simplified process of surface fitting can significantly improve the accuracy of the normal estimation. In this paper, two simple-yet-effective strategies are proposed to address the compatibility between the neural networks and surface fitting process to improve normal estimation. Firstly, a dynamic top-k selection strategy is introduced to better focus on the most critical points of a given patch, and the points selected by our learning method tend to fit a surface by way of a simple tangent plane, which can dramatically improve the normal estimation results of patches with sharp corners or complex patterns. Then, we propose a point update strategy before local surface fitting, which smooths the sharp boundary of the patch to simplify the surface fitting process, significantly reducing the fitting distortion and improving the accuracy of the predicted point normal. The experiments analyze the effectiveness of our proposed strategies and demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA results with the advantage of higher estimation accuracy over most existed approaches.



### Towards Corruption-Agnostic Robust Domain Adaptation

- **Comment**: The first literature to investigate the topic of corruption-agnostic
  robust domain adaptation, a new practical and challenging domain adaptation
  setting
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Big progress has been achieved in domain adaptation in decades. Existing works are always based on an ideal assumption that testing target domain are i.i.d. with training target domains. However, due to unpredictable corruptions (e.g., noise and blur) in real data like web images, domain adaptation methods are increasingly required to be corruption robust on target domains. In this paper, we investigate a new task, Corruption-agnostic Robust Domain Adaptation (CRDA): to be accurate on original data and robust against unavailable-for-training corruptions on target domains. This task is non-trivial due to large domain discrepancy and unsupervised target domains. We observe that simple combinations of popular methods of domain adaptation and corruption robustness have sub-optimal CRDA results. We propose a new approach based on two technical insights into CRDA: 1) an easy-to-plug module called Domain Discrepancy Generator (DDG) that generates samples that enlarge domain discrepancy to mimic unpredictable corruptions; 2) a simple but effective teacher-student scheme with contrastive loss to enhance the constraints on target domains. Experiments verify that DDG keeps or even improves performance on original data and achieves better corruption robustness that baselines.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples/attacks, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. A number of defense methods have been proposed to train robust DNNs resistant to adversarial attacks, among which adversarial training has so far demonstrated the most promising results. However, recent studies have shown that there exists an inherent tradeoff between accuracy and robustness in adversarially-trained DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel technique Dual Head Adversarial Training (DH-AT) to further improve the robustness of existing adversarial training methods. Different from existing improved variants of adversarial training, DH-AT modifies both the architecture of the network and the training strategy to seek more robustness. Specifically, DH-AT first attaches a second network head (or branch) to one intermediate layer of the network, then uses a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) to aggregate the outputs of the two heads. The training strategy is also adapted to reflect the relative importance of the two heads. We empirically show, on multiple benchmark datasets, that DH-AT can bring notable robustness improvements to existing adversarial training methods. Compared with TRADES, one state-of-the-art adversarial training method, our DH-AT can improve the robustness by 3.4% against PGD40 and 2.3% against AutoAttack, and also improve the clean accuracy by 1.8%.

First, we design the reliability-based attention module to analyze the reliability of multiple annotated frames. Second, we develop the intersection-aware propagation module to propagate segmentation results to neighboring frames. Third, we introduce the GIS mechanism for a user to select unsatisfactory frames quickly with less effort. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate segmentation results at a faster speed than conventional algorithms.

- **Summary**: Vehicle re-identification helps in distinguishing between images of the same and other vehicles. It is a challenging process because of significant intra-instance differences between identical vehicles from different views and subtle inter-instance differences between similar vehicles. To solve this issue, researchers have extracted view-aware or part-specific features via spatial attention mechanisms, which usually result in noisy attention maps or otherwise require expensive additional annotation for metadata, such as key points, to improve the quality. Meanwhile, based on the researchers' insights, various handcrafted multi-attention architectures for specific viewpoints or vehicle parts have been proposed. However, this approach does not guarantee that the number and nature of attention branches will be optimal for real-world re-identification tasks. To address these problems, we proposed a new vehicle re-identification network based on a multiple soft attention mechanism for capturing various discriminative regions from different viewpoints more efficiently. Furthermore, this model can significantly reduce the noise in spatial attention maps by devising a new method for creating an attention map for insignificant regions and then excluding it from generating the final result. We also combined a channel-wise attention mechanism with a spatial attention mechanism for the efficient selection of important semantic attributes for vehicle re-identification. Our experiments showed that our proposed model achieved a state-of-the-art performance among the attention-based methods without metadata and was comparable to the approaches using metadata for the VehicleID and VERI-Wild datasets.

- **Summary**: Image-text matching is an important multi-modal task with massive applications. It tries to match the image and the text with similar semantic information. Existing approaches do not explicitly transform the different modalities into a common space. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism which is widely used in image-text matching models does not have supervision. We propose a novel attention scheme which projects the image and text embedding into a common space and optimises the attention weights directly towards the evaluation metrics. The proposed attention scheme can be considered as a kind of supervised attention and requiring no additional annotations. It is trained via a novel Discrete-continuous action space policy gradient algorithm, which is more effective in modelling complex action space than previous continuous action space policy gradient. We evaluate the proposed methods on two widely-used benchmark datasets: Flickr30k and MS-COCO, outperforming the previous approaches by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Blockage of culverts by transported debris materials is reported as main contributor in originating urban flash floods. Conventional modelling approaches had no success in addressing the problem largely because of unavailability of peak floods hydraulic data and highly non-linear behaviour of debris at culvert. This article explores a new dimension to investigate the issue by proposing the use of Intelligent Video Analytic (IVA) algorithms for extracting blockage related information. Potential of using existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms (i.e., DarkNet53, DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB3, NASNet) is investigated over a custom collected blockage dataset (i.e., Images of Culvert Openings and Blockage (ICOB)) to predict the blockage in a given image. Models were evaluated based on their performance on test dataset (i.e., accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score, Jaccard-Index), Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPs) and response times to process a single test instance. From the results, NASNet was reported most efficient in classifying the blockage with the accuracy of 85\%; however, EfficientNetB3 was recommended for the hardware implementation because of its improved response time with accuracy comparable to NASNet (i.e., 83\%). False Negative (FN) instances, False Positive (FP) instances and CNN layers activation suggested that background noise and oversimplified labelling criteria were two contributing factors in degraded performance of existing CNN algorithms.

- **Summary**: We investigate Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which outputs a segmentation map corresponding to the natural language description. Addressing RIS efficiently requires considering the interactions happening across visual and linguistic modalities and the interactions within each modality. Existing methods are limited because they either compute different forms of interactions sequentially (leading to error propagation) or ignore intramodal interactions. We address this limitation by performing all three interactions simultaneously through a Synchronous Multi-Modal Fusion Module (SFM). Moreover, to produce refined segmentation masks, we propose a novel Hierarchical Cross-Modal Aggregation Module (HCAM), where linguistic features facilitate the exchange of contextual information across the visual hierarchy. We present thorough ablation studies and validate our approach's performance on four benchmark datasets, showing considerable performance gains over the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

- **Summary**: Although deep convolution neural networks (DCNN) have achieved excellent performance in human pose estimation, these networks often have a large number of parameters and computations, leading to the slow inference speed. For this issue, an effective solution is knowledge distillation, which transfers knowledge from a large pre-trained network (teacher) to a small network (student). However, there are some defects in the existing approaches: (I) Only a single teacher is adopted, neglecting the potential that a student can learn from multiple teachers. (II) The human segmentation mask can be regarded as additional prior information to restrict the location of keypoints, which is never utilized. (III) A student with a small number of parameters cannot fully imitate heatmaps provided by datasets and teachers. (IV) There exists noise in heatmaps generated by teachers, which causes model degradation. To overcome these defects, we propose an orderly dual-teacher knowledge distillation (ODKD) framework, which consists of two teachers with different capabilities. Specifically, the weaker one (primary teacher, PT) is used to teach keypoints information, the stronger one (senior teacher, ST) is utilized to transfer segmentation and keypoints information by adding the human segmentation mask. Taking dual-teacher together, an orderly learning strategy is proposed to promote knowledge absorbability. Moreover, we employ a binarization operation which further improves the learning ability of the student and reduces noise in heatmaps. Experimental results on COCO and OCHuman keypoints datasets show that our proposed ODKD can improve the performance of different lightweight models by a large margin, and HRNet-W16 equipped with ODKD achieves state-of-the-art performance for lightweight human pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Being effective and efficient is essential to an object detector for practical use. To meet these two concerns, we comprehensively evaluate a collection of existing refinements to improve the performance of PP-YOLO while almost keep the infer time unchanged. This paper will analyze a collection of refinements and empirically evaluate their impact on the final model performance through incremental ablation study. Things we tried that didn't work will also be discussed. By combining multiple effective refinements, we boost PP-YOLO's performance from 45.9% mAP to 49.5% mAP on COCO2017 test-dev. Since a significant margin of performance has been made, we present PP-YOLOv2. In terms of speed, PP-YOLOv2 runs in 68.9FPS at 640x640 input size. Paddle inference engine with TensorRT, FP16-precision, and batch size = 1 further improves PP-YOLOv2's infer speed, which achieves 106.5 FPS. Such a performance surpasses existing object detectors with roughly the same amount of parameters (i.e., YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv5l). Besides, PP-YOLOv2 with ResNet101 achieves 50.3% mAP on COCO2017 test-dev. Source code is at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection.

- **Summary**: Fatigue detection is valued for people to keep mental health and prevent safety accidents. However, detecting facial fatigue, especially mild fatigue in the real world via machine vision is still a challenging issue due to lack of non-lab dataset and well-defined algorithms. In order to improve the detection capability on facial fatigue that can be used widely in daily life, this paper provided an audiovisual dataset named DLFD (daily-life fatigue dataset) which reflected people's facial fatigue state in the wild. A framework using 3D-ResNet along with non-local attention mechanism was training for extraction of local and long-range features in spatial and temporal dimensions. Then, a compacted loss function combining mean squared error and cross-entropy was designed to predict both continuous and categorical fatigue degrees. Our proposed framework has reached an average accuracy of 90.8% on validation set and 72.5% on test set for binary classification, standing a good position compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The analysis of feature map visualization revealed that our framework captured facial dynamics and attempted to build a connection with fatigue state. Our experimental results in multiple metrics proved that our framework captured some typical, micro and dynamic facial features along spatiotemporal dimensions, contributing to the mild fatigue detection in the wild.

- **Summary**: Object localisation, in the context of regular images, often depicts objects like people or cars. In these images, there is typically a relatively small number of objects per class, which usually is manageable to annotate. However, outside the setting of regular images, we are often confronted with a different situation. In computational pathology, digitised tissue sections are extremely large images, whose dimensions quickly exceed 250'000x250'000 pixels, where relevant objects, such as tumour cells or lymphocytes can quickly number in the millions. Annotating them all is practically impossible and annotating sparsely a few, out of many more, is the only possibility. Unfortunately, learning from sparse annotations, or sparse-shot learning, clashes with standard supervised learning because what is not annotated is treated as a negative. However, assigning negative labels to what are true positives leads to confusion in the gradients and biased learning. To this end, we present exclusive cross-entropy, which slows down the biased learning by examining the second-order loss derivatives in order to drop the loss terms corresponding to likely biased terms. Experiments on nine datasets and two different localisation tasks, detection with YOLLO and segmentation with Unet, show that we obtain considerable improvements compared to cross-entropy or focal loss, while often reaching the best possible performance for the model with only 10-40% of annotations.

- **Summary**: One of the main challenges for arbitrary-shaped text detection is to design a good text instance representation that allows networks to learn diverse text geometry variances. Most of existing methods model text instances in image spatial domain via masks or contour point sequences in the Cartesian or the polar coordinate system. However, the mask representation might lead to expensive post-processing, while the point sequence one may have limited capability to model texts with highly-curved shapes. To tackle these problems, we model text instances in the Fourier domain and propose one novel Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) method to represent arbitrary shaped text contours as compact signatures. We further construct FCENet with a backbone, feature pyramid networks (FPN) and a simple post-processing with the Inverse Fourier Transformation (IFT) and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Different from previous methods, FCENet first predicts compact Fourier signatures of text instances, and then reconstructs text contours via IFT and NMS during test. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FCE is accurate and robust to fit contours of scene texts even with highly-curved shapes, and also validate the effectiveness and the good generalization of FCENet for arbitrary-shaped text detection. Furthermore, experimental results show that our FCENet is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on CTW1500 and Total-Text, especially on challenging highly-curved text subset.

- **Summary**: Non-rigid registration is a necessary but challenging task in medical imaging studies. Recently, unsupervised registration models have shown good performance, but they often require a large-scale training dataset and long training times. Therefore, in real world application where only dozens to hundreds of image pairs are available, existing models cannot be practically used. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised registration model which is integrated with a gradient-based meta learning framework. In particular, we train a meta learner which finds an initialization point of parameters by utilizing a variety of existing registration datasets. To quickly adapt to various tasks, the meta learner was updated to get close to the center of parameters which are fine-tuned for each registration task. Thereby, our model can adapt to unseen domain tasks via a short fine-tuning process and perform accurate registration. To verify the superiority of our model, we train the model for various 2D medical image registration tasks such as retinal choroid Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), CT organs, and brain MRI scans and test on registration of retinal OCTA Superficial Capillary Plexus (SCP). In our experiments, the proposed model obtained significantly improved performance in terms of accuracy and training time compared to other registration models.

- **Summary**: One-class anomaly detection is challenging. A representation that clearly distinguishes anomalies from normal data is ideal, but arriving at this representation is difficult since only normal data is available at training time. We examine the performance of representations, transferred from auxiliary tasks, for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that the choice of representation is more important than the anomaly detector used with these representations, although knowledge distillation can work better than using the representations directly. In addition, separability between anomalies and normal data is important but not the sole factor for a good representation, as anomaly detection performance is also correlated with more adversarially brittle features in the representation space. Finally, we show our configuration can detect 96.4% of anomalies in a genuine X-ray security dataset, outperforming previous results.

- **Summary**: Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are input perturbations that can fool a neural network on large sets of data. They are a class of attacks that represents a significant threat as they facilitate realistic, practical, and low-cost attacks on neural networks. In this work, we derive upper bounds for the effectiveness of UAPs based on norms of data-dependent Jacobians. We empirically verify that Jacobian regularization greatly increases model robustness to UAPs by up to four times whilst maintaining clean performance. Our theoretical analysis also allows us to formulate a metric for the strength of shared adversarial perturbations between pairs of inputs. We apply this metric to benchmark datasets and show that it is highly correlated with the actual observed robustness. This suggests that realistic and practical universal attacks can be reliably mitigated without sacrificing clean accuracy, which shows promise for the robustness of machine learning systems.

- **Summary**: Deploying deep learning services for time-sensitive and resource-constrained settings such as IoT using edge computing systems is a challenging task that requires dynamic adjustment of inference time. Multi-exit architectures allow deep neural networks to terminate their execution early in order to adhere to tight deadlines at the cost of accuracy. To mitigate this cost, in this paper we introduce a novel method called Multi-Exit Curriculum Learning that utilizes curriculum learning, a training strategy for neural networks that imitates human learning by sorting the training samples based on their difficulty and gradually introducing them to the network. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and various configurations of multi-exit architectures show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of early exits compared to the standard training approach.

- **Summary**: Camouflaged object segmentation (COS) aims to identify objects that are "perfectly" assimilate into their surroundings, which has a wide range of valuable applications. The key challenge of COS is that there exist high intrinsic similarities between the candidate objects and noise background. In this paper, we strive to embrace challenges towards effective and efficient COS. To this end, we develop a bio-inspired framework, termed Positioning and Focus Network (PFNet), which mimics the process of predation in nature. Specifically, our PFNet contains two key modules, i.e., the positioning module (PM) and the focus module (FM). The PM is designed to mimic the detection process in predation for positioning the potential target objects from a global perspective and the FM is then used to perform the identification process in predation for progressively refining the coarse prediction via focusing on the ambiguous regions. Notably, in the FM, we develop a novel distraction mining strategy for distraction discovery and removal, to benefit the performance of estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PFNet runs in real-time (72 FPS) and significantly outperforms 18 cutting-edge models on three challenging datasets under four standard metrics.

- **Summary**: In medical image analysis, the cost of acquiring high-quality data and their annotation by experts is a barrier in many medical applications. Most of the techniques used are based on supervised learning framework and need a large amount of annotated data to achieve satisfactory performance. As an alternative, in this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to learn the spatial anatomical representations from the frames of magnetic resonance (MR) video clips for the diagnosis of knee medical conditions. The pretext model learns meaningful spatial context-invariant representations. The downstream task in our paper is a class imbalanced multi-label classification. Different experiments show that the features learnt by the pretext model provide competitive performance in the downstream task. Moreover, the efficiency and reliability of the proposed pretext model in learning representations of minority classes without applying any strategy towards imbalance in the dataset can be seen from the results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work of its kind in showing the effectiveness and reliability of self-supervised learning algorithms in class imbalanced multi-label classification tasks on MR videos.   The code for evaluation of the proposed work is available at https://github.com/sadimanna/skid.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely explored in single image super-resolution (SISR) and contribute remarkable progress. However, most of the existing CNNs-based SISR methods do not adequately explore contextual information in the feature extraction stage and pay little attention to the final high-resolution (HR) image reconstruction step, hence hindering the desired SR performance. To address the above two issues, in this paper, we propose a two-stage attentive network (TSAN) for accurate SISR in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we design a novel multi-context attentive block (MCAB) to make the network focus on more informative contextual features. Moreover, we present an essential refined attention block (RAB) which could explore useful cues in HR space for reconstructing fine-detailed HR image. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed TSAN in terms of quantitative metrics and visual effects.

- **Summary**: Driving requires interacting with road agents and predicting their future behaviour in order to navigate safely. We present FIERY: a probabilistic future prediction model in bird's-eye view from monocular cameras. Our model predicts future instance segmentation and motion of dynamic agents that can be transformed into non-parametric future trajectories. Our approach combines the perception, sensor fusion and prediction components of a traditional autonomous driving stack by estimating bird's-eye-view prediction directly from surround RGB monocular camera inputs. FIERY learns to model the inherent stochastic nature of the future solely from camera driving data in an end-to-end manner, without relying on HD maps, and predicts multimodal future trajectories. We show that our model outperforms previous prediction baselines on the NuScenes and Lyft datasets. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/wayveai/fiery.

- **Summary**: Video action recognition (VAR) is a primary task of video understanding, and untrimmed videos are more common in real-life scenes. Untrimmed videos have redundant and diverse clips containing contextual information, so sampling dense clips is essential. Recently, some works attempt to train a generic model to select the N most representative clips. However, it is difficult to model the complex relations from intra-class clips and inter-class videos within a single model and fixed selected number, and the entanglement of multiple relations is also hard to explain. Thus, instead of "only look once", we argue "divide and conquer" strategy will be more suitable in untrimmed VAR. Inspired by the speed reading mechanism, we propose a simple yet effective clip-level solution based on skim-scan techniques. Specifically, the proposed Skim-Scan framework first skims the entire video and drops those uninformative and misleading clips. For the remaining clips, it scans clips with diverse features gradually to drop redundant clips but cover essential content. The above strategies can adaptively select the necessary clips according to the difficulty of the different videos. To trade off the computational complexity and performance, we observe the similar statistical expression between lightweight and heavy networks, thus it supports us to explore the combination of them. Comprehensive experiments are performed on ActivityNet and mini-FCVID datasets, and results demonstrate that our solution surpasses the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Deep models trained on long-tailed datasets exhibit unsatisfactory performance on tail classes. Existing methods usually modify the classification loss to increase the learning focus on tail classes, which unexpectedly sacrifice the performance on head classes. In fact, this scheme leads to a contradiction between the two goals of long-tailed learning, i.e., learning generalizable representations and facilitating learning for tail classes. In this work, we explore knowledge distillation in long-tailed scenarios and propose a novel distillation framework, named Balanced Knowledge Distillation (BKD), to disentangle the contradiction between the two goals and achieve both simultaneously. Specifically, given a vanilla teacher model, we train the student model by minimizing the combination of an instance-balanced classification loss and a class-balanced distillation loss. The former benefits from the sample diversity and learns generalizable representation, while the latter considers the class priors and facilitates learning mainly for tail classes. The student model trained with BKD obtains significant performance gain even compared with its teacher model. We conduct extensive experiments on several long-tailed benchmark datasets and demonstrate that the proposed BKD is an effective knowledge distillation framework in long-tailed scenarios, as well as a new state-of-the-art method for long-tailed learning.

- **Summary**: Drone imagery is increasingly used in automated inspection for infrastructure surface defects, especially in hazardous or unreachable environments. In machine vision, the key to crack detection rests with robust and accurate algorithms for image processing. To this end, this paper proposes a deep learning approach using hierarchical convolutional neural networks with feature preservation (HCNNFP) and an intercontrast iterative thresholding algorithm for image binarization. First, a set of branch networks is proposed, wherein the output of previous convolutional blocks is half-sizedly concatenated to the current ones to reduce the obscuration in the down-sampling stage taking into account the overall information loss. Next, to extract the feature map generated from the enhanced HCNN, a binary contrast-based autotuned thresholding (CBAT) approach is developed at the post-processing step, where patterns of interest are clustered within the probability map of the identified features. The proposed technique is then applied to identify surface cracks on the surface of roads, bridges or pavements. An extensive comparison with existing techniques is conducted on various datasets and subject to a number of evaluation criteria including the average F-measure (AF\b{eta}) introduced here for dynamic quantification of the performance. Experiments on crack images, including those captured by unmanned aerial vehicles inspecting a monorail bridge. The proposed technique outperforms the existing methods on various tested datasets especially for GAPs dataset with an increase of about 1.4% in terms of AF\b{eta} while the mean percentage error drops by 2.2%. Such performance demonstrates the merits of the proposed HCNNFP architecture for surface defect inspection.

- **Summary**: Real-time 3D reconstruction enables fast dense mapping of the environment which benefits numerous applications, such as navigation or live evaluation of an emergency. In contrast to most real-time capable approaches, our approach does not need an explicit depth sensor. Instead, we only rely on a video stream from a camera and its intrinsic calibration. By exploiting the self-motion of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying with oblique view around buildings, we estimate both camera trajectory and depth for selected images with enough novel content. To create a 3D model of the scene, we rely on a three-stage processing chain. First, we estimate the rough camera trajectory using a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Once a suitable constellation is found, we estimate depth for local bundles of images using a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) approach and then fuse this depth into a global surfel-based model. For our evaluation, we use 55 video sequences with diverse settings, consisting of both synthetic and real scenes. We evaluate not only the generated reconstruction but also the intermediate products and achieve competitive results both qualitatively and quantitatively. At the same time, our method can keep up with a 30 fps video for a resolution of 768x448 pixels.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the novel approach towards table structure recognition by leveraging the guided anchors. The concept differs from current state-of-the-art approaches for table structure recognition that naively apply object detection methods. In contrast to prior techniques, first, we estimate the viable anchors for table structure recognition. Subsequently, these anchors are exploited to locate the rows and columns in tabular images. Furthermore, the paper introduces a simple and effective method that improves the results by using tabular layouts in realistic scenarios. The proposed method is exhaustively evaluated on the two publicly available datasets of table structure recognition i.e ICDAR-2013 and TabStructDB. We accomplished state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR-2013 dataset with an average F-Measure of 95.05$\%$ (94.6$\%$ for rows and 96.32$\%$ for columns) and surpassed the baseline results on the TabStructDB dataset with an average F-Measure of 94.17$\%$ (94.08$\%$ for rows and 95.06$\%$ for columns).

- **Summary**: Invertible networks have various benefits for image denoising since they are lightweight, information-lossless, and memory-saving during back-propagation. However, applying invertible models to remove noise is challenging because the input is noisy, and the reversed output is clean, following two different distributions. We propose an invertible denoising network, InvDN, to address this challenge. InvDN transforms the noisy input into a low-resolution clean image and a latent representation containing noise. To discard noise and restore the clean image, InvDN replaces the noisy latent representation with another one sampled from a prior distribution during reversion. The denoising performance of InvDN is better than all the existing competitive models, achieving a new state-of-the-art result for the SIDD dataset while enjoying less run time. Moreover, the size of InvDN is far smaller, only having 4.2% of the number of parameters compared to the most recently proposed DANet. Further, via manipulating the noisy latent representation, InvDN is also able to generate noise more similar to the original one.

- **Summary**: Two DL models were developed using radiograph-level annotations (yes or no disease) and fine-grained lesion-level annotations (lesion bounding boxes), respectively named CheXNet and CheXDet. The models' internal classification performance and lesion localization performance were compared on a testing set (n=2,922), external classification performance was compared on NIH-Google (n=4,376) and PadChest (n=24,536) datasets, and external lesion localization performance was compared on NIH-ChestX-ray14 dataset (n=880). The models were also compared to radiologists on a subset of the internal testing set (n=496). Given sufficient training data, both models performed comparably to radiologists. CheXDet achieved significant improvement for external classification, such as in classifying fracture on NIH-Google (CheXDet area under the ROC curve [AUC]: 0.67, CheXNet AUC: 0.51; p<.001) and PadChest (CheXDet AUC: 0.78, CheXNet AUC: 0.55; p<.001). CheXDet achieved higher lesion detection performance than CheXNet for most abnormalities on all datasets, such as in detecting pneumothorax on the internal set (CheXDet jacknife alternative free-response ROC-figure of merit [JAFROC-FOM]: 0.87, CheXNet JAFROC-FOM: 0.13; p<.001) and NIH-ChestX-ray14 (CheXDet JAFROC-FOM: 0.55, CheXNet JAFROC-FOM: 0.04; p<.001). To summarize, fine-grained annotations overcame shortcut learning and enabled DL models to identify correct lesion patterns, improving the models' generalizability.

- **Summary**: Humans have a remarkable ability to make decisions by accurately reasoning about future events, including the future behaviors and states of mind of other agents. Consider driving a car through a busy intersection: it is necessary to reason about the physics of the vehicle, the intentions of other drivers, and their beliefs about your own intentions. If you signal a turn, another driver might yield to you, or if you enter the passing lane, another driver might decelerate to give you room to merge in front. Competent drivers must plan how they can safely react to a variety of potential future behaviors of other agents before they make their next move. This requires contingency planning: explicitly planning a set of conditional actions that depend on the stochastic outcome of future events. In this work, we develop a general-purpose contingency planner that is learned end-to-end using high-dimensional scene observations and low-dimensional behavioral observations. We use a conditional autoregressive flow model to create a compact contingency planning space, and show how this model can tractably learn contingencies from behavioral observations. We developed a closed-loop control benchmark of realistic multi-agent scenarios in a driving simulator (CARLA), on which we compare our method to various noncontingent methods that reason about multi-agent future behavior, including several state-of-the-art deep learning-based planning approaches. We illustrate that these noncontingent planning methods fundamentally fail on this benchmark, and find that our deep contingency planning method achieves significantly superior performance.

- **Summary**: Being able to segment unseen classes not observed during training is an important technical challenge in deep learning, because of its potential to reduce the expensive annotation required for semantic segmentation. Prior zero-label semantic segmentation works approach this task by learning visual-semantic embeddings or generative models. However, they are prone to overfitting on the seen classes because there is no training signal for them. In this paper, we study the challenging generalized zero-label semantic segmentation task where the model has to segment both seen and unseen classes at test time. We assume that pixels of unseen classes could be present in the training images but without being annotated. Our idea is to capture the latent information on unseen classes by supervising the model with self-produced pseudo-labels for unlabeled pixels. We propose a consistency regularizer to filter out noisy pseudo-labels by taking the intersections of the pseudo-labels generated from different augmentations of the same image. Our framework generates pseudo-labels and then retrain the model with human-annotated and pseudo-labelled data. This procedure is repeated for several iterations. As a result, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art on PascalVOC12 and COCO-stuff datasets in the challenging generalized zero-label semantic segmentation setting, surpassing other existing methods addressing this task with more complex strategies.

- **Summary**: This paper presents deep unfolding neural networks to handle inverse problems in photothermal radiometry enabling super resolution (SR) imaging. Photothermal imaging is a well-known technique in active thermography for nondestructive inspection of defects in materials such as metals or composites. A grand challenge of active thermography is to overcome the spatial resolution limitation imposed by heat diffusion in order to accurately resolve each defect. The photothermal SR approach enables to extract high-frequency spatial components based on the deconvolution with the thermal point spread function. However, stable deconvolution can only be achieved by using the sparse structure of defect patterns, which often requires tedious, hand-crafted tuning of hyperparameters and results in computationally intensive algorithms. On this account, Photothermal-SR-Net is proposed in this paper, which performs deconvolution by deep unfolding considering the underlying physics. This enables to super resolve 2D thermal images for nondestructive testing with a substantially improved convergence rate. Since defects appear sparsely in materials, Photothermal-SR-Net applies trained block-sparsity thresholding to the acquired thermal images in each convolutional layer. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and discussed using various deep unfolding and thresholding approaches applied to 2D thermal images. Subsequently, studies are conducted on how to increase the reconstruction quality and the computational performance of Photothermal-SR-Net is evaluated. Thereby, it was found that the computing time for creating high-resolution images could be significantly reduced without decreasing the reconstruction quality by using pixel binning as a preprocessing step.

- **Summary**: In recent years, virtual makeup applications have become more and more popular. However, it is still challenging to propose a robust makeup transfer method in the real-world environment. Current makeup transfer methods mostly work well on good-conditioned clean makeup images, but transferring makeup that exhibits shadow and occlusion is not satisfying. To alleviate it, we propose a novel makeup transfer method, called 3D-Aware Shadow and Occlusion Robust GAN (SOGAN). Given the source and the reference faces, we first fit a 3D face model and then disentangle the faces into shape and texture. In the texture branch, we map the texture to the UV space and design a UV texture generator to transfer the makeup. Since human faces are symmetrical in the UV space, we can conveniently remove the undesired shadow and occlusion from the reference image by carefully designing a Flip Attention Module (FAM). After obtaining cleaner makeup features from the reference image, a Makeup Transfer Module (MTM) is introduced to perform accurate makeup transfer. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our SOGAN not only achieves superior results in shadow and occlusion situations but also performs well in large pose and expression variations.

- **Summary**: Incremental learning aims to enable machine learning models to continuously acquire new knowledge given new classes, while maintaining the knowledge already learned for old classes. Saving a subset of training samples of previously seen classes in the memory and replaying them during new training phases is proven to be an efficient and effective way to fulfil this aim. It is evident that the larger number of exemplars the model inherits the better performance it can achieve. However, finding a trade-off between the model performance and the number of samples to save for each class is still an open problem for replay-based incremental learning and is increasingly desirable for real-life applications. In this paper, we approach this open problem by tapping into a two-step compression approach. The first step is a lossy compression, we propose to encode input images and save their discrete latent representations in the form of codes that are learned using a hierarchical Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). In the second step, we further compress codes losslessly by learning a hierarchical latent variable model with bits-back asymmetric numeral systems (BB-ANS). To compensate for the information lost in the first step compression, we introduce an Information Back (IB) mechanism that utilizes real exemplars for a contrastive learning loss to regularize the training of a classifier. By maintaining all seen exemplars' representations in the format of `codes', Discrete Representation Replay (DRR) outperforms the state-of-art method on CIFAR-100 by a margin of 4% accuracy with a much less memory cost required for saving samples. Incorporated with IB and saving a small set of old raw exemplars as well, the accuracy of DRR can be further improved by 2% accuracy.

- **Summary**: Resting state functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) are commonly used for classification of patients as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or being cognitive normal (CN). Most methods use time-series correlation of voxels signals during the observation period as a basis for the classification. In this paper we show that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification based on spatial correlation of time-averaged signals yield a classification accuracy of up to 82% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 80%)for a data set with 429 subjects (246 cognitive normal and 183 Alzheimer patients). For the spatial correlation of time-averaged signal values we use voxel subdomains around center points of the 90 regions AAL atlas. We form the subdomains as sets of voxels along a Hilbert curve of a bounding box in which the brain is embedded with the AAL regions center points serving as subdomain seeds. The matrix resulting from the spatial correlation of the 90 arrays formed by the subdomain segments of the Hilbert curve yields a symmetric 90x90 matrix that is used for the classification based on two different CNN networks, a 4-layer CNN network with 3x3 filters and with 4, 8, 16, and 32 output channels respectively, and a 2-layer CNN network with 3x3 filters and with 4 and 8 output channels respectively. The results of the two networks are reported and compared.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel 3D human pose estimation approach using a single stream of asynchronous events as input. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches solve this task with RGB cameras, however struggling when subjects are moving fast. On the other hand, event-based 3D pose estimation benefits from the advantages of event-cameras, especially their efficiency and robustness to appearance changes. Yet, finding human poses in asynchronous events is in general more challenging than standard RGB pose estimation, since little or no events are triggered in static scenes. Here we propose the first learning-based method for 3D human pose from a single stream of events. Our method consists of two steps. First, we process the event-camera stream to predict three orthogonal heatmaps per joint; each heatmap is the projection of of the joint onto one orthogonal plane. Next, we fuse the sets of heatmaps to estimate 3D localisation of the body joints. As a further contribution, we make available a new, challenging dataset for event-based human pose estimation by simulating events from the RGB Human3.6m dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves solid accuracy, narrowing the performance gap between standard RGB and event-based vision.

- **Summary**: Differentiable simulations of optical systems can be combined with deep learning-based reconstruction networks to enable high performance computational imaging via end-to-end (E2E) optimization of both the optical encoder and the deep decoder. This has enabled imaging applications such as 3D localization microscopy, depth estimation, and lensless photography via the optimization of local optical encoders. More challenging computational imaging applications, such as 3D snapshot microscopy which compresses 3D volumes into single 2D images, require a highly non-local optical encoder. We show that existing deep network decoders have a locality bias which prevents the optimization of such highly non-local optical encoders. We address this with a decoder based on a shallow neural network architecture using global kernel Fourier convolutional neural networks (FourierNets). We show that FourierNets surpass existing deep network based decoders at reconstructing photographs captured by the highly non-local DiffuserCam optical encoder. Further, we show that FourierNets enable E2E optimization of highly non-local optical encoders for 3D snapshot microscopy. By combining FourierNets with a large-scale multi-GPU differentiable optical simulation, we are able to optimize non-local optical encoders 170$\times$ to 7372$\times$ larger than prior state of the art, and demonstrate the potential for ROI-type specific optical encoding with a programmable microscope.

- **Summary**: Recurrent connectivity in the visual cortex is believed to aid object recognition for challenging conditions such as occlusion. Here we investigate if and how artificial neural networks also benefit from recurrence. We compare architectures composed of bottom-up, lateral and top-down connections and evaluate their performance using two novel stereoscopic occluded object datasets. We find that classification accuracy is significantly higher for recurrent models when compared to feedforward models of matched parametric complexity. Additionally we show that for challenging stimuli, the recurrent feedback is able to correctly revise the initial feedforward guess.

- **Summary**: Mesh reconstruction from a 3D point cloud is an important topic in the fields of computer graphic, computer vision, and multimedia analysis. In this paper, we propose a voxel structure-based mesh reconstruction framework. It provides the intrinsic metric to improve the accuracy of local region detection. Based on the detected local regions, an initial reconstructed mesh can be obtained. With the mesh optimization in our framework, the initial reconstructed mesh is optimized into an isotropic one with the important geometric features such as external and internal edges. The experimental results indicate that our framework shows great advantages over peer ones in terms of mesh quality, geometric feature keeping, and processing speed.

Our method, named MetricOpt, operates in a black-box setting where the computational details of the target metric are unknown. We achieve this by learning a differentiable value function, which maps compact task-specific model parameters to metric observations. The learned value function is easily pluggable into existing optimizers like SGD and Adam, and is effective for rapidly finetuning a pre-trained model. This leads to consistent improvements since the value function provides effective metric supervision during finetuning, and helps to correct the potential bias of loss-only supervision. MetricOpt achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of metrics for (image) classification, image retrieval and object detection. Solid benefits are found over competing methods, which often involve complex loss design or adaptation. MetricOpt also generalizes well to new tasks and model architectures.

- **Summary**: Space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) aims to increase the spatial and temporal resolutions of low-resolution and low-frame-rate videos. Recently, deformable convolution based methods have achieved promising STVSR performance, but they could only infer the intermediate frame pre-defined in the training stage. Besides, these methods undervalued the short-term motion cues among adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Modulation Network (TMNet) to interpolate arbitrary intermediate frame(s) with accurate high-resolution reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Modulation Block (TMB) to modulate deformable convolution kernels for controllable feature interpolation. To well exploit the temporal information, we propose a Locally-temporal Feature Comparison (LFC) module, along with the Bi-directional Deformable ConvLSTM, to extract short-term and long-term motion cues in videos. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TMNet outperforms previous STVSR methods. The code is available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/TMNet.

- **Summary**: It is common in anthropology and paleontology to address questions about extant and extinct species through the quantification of osteological features observable in micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) scans. In cases where remains were buried, the grey values present in these scans may be classified as belonging to air, dirt, or bone. While various intensity-based methods have been proposed to segment scans into these classes, it is often the case that intensity values for dirt and bone are nearly indistinguishable. In these instances, scientists resort to laborious manual segmentation, which does not scale well in practice when a large number of scans are to be analyzed. Here we present a new domain-enriched network for three-class image segmentation, which utilizes the domain knowledge of experts familiar with manually segmenting bone and dirt structures. More precisely, our novel structure consists of two components: 1) a representation network trained on special samples based on newly designed custom loss terms, which extracts discriminative bone and dirt features, 2) and a segmentation network that leverages these extracted discriminative features. These two parts are jointly trained in order to optimize the segmentation performance. A comparison of our network to that of the current state-of-the-art U-NETs demonstrates the benefits of our proposal, particularly when the number of labeled training images are limited, which is invariably the case for micro-CT segmentation.

- **Summary**: Object detection is one of the fundamental objectives in Applied Computer Vision. In some of the applications, object detection becomes very challenging such as in the case of satellite image processing. Satellite image processing has remained the focus of researchers in domains of Precision Agriculture, Climate Change, Disaster Management, etc. Therefore, object detection in satellite imagery is one of the most researched problems in this domain. This paper focuses on aircraft detection. in satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. In this paper, we used YOLO deep learning framework for aircraft detection. This method uses satellite images collected by different sources as learning for the model to perform detection. Object detection in satellite images is mostly complex because objects have many variations, types, poses, sizes, complex and dense background. YOLO has some limitations for small size objects (less than$\sim$32 pixels per object), therefore we upsample the prediction grid to reduce the coarseness of the model and to accurately detect the densely clustered objects. The improved model shows good accuracy and performance on different unknown images having small, rotating, and dense objects to meet the requirements in real-time.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a Fully Spiking Hybrid Neural Network (FSHNN) for energy-efficient and robust object detection in resource-constrained platforms. The network architecture is based on Convolutional SNN using leaky-integrate-fire neuron models. The model combines unsupervised Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning with back-propagation (STBP) learning methods and also uses Monte Carlo Dropout to get an estimate of the uncertainty error. FSHNN provides better accuracy compared to DNN based object detectors while being 150X energy-efficient. It also outperforms these object detectors, when subjected to noisy input data and less labeled training data with a lower uncertainty error.

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims at improving the perception or interpretability of an image captured in an environment with poor illumination. Recent advances in this area are dominated by deep learning-based solutions, where many learning strategies, network structures, loss functions, training data, etc. have been employed. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from algorithm taxonomy to open issues. To examine the generalization of existing methods, we propose a low-light image and video dataset, in which the images and videos are taken by different mobile phones' cameras under diverse illumination conditions. Besides, for the first time, we provide a unified online platform that covers many popular LLIE methods, of which the results can be produced through a user-friendly web interface. In addition to qualitative and quantitative evaluation of existing methods on publicly available and our proposed datasets, we also validate their performance in face detection in the dark.This survey together with the proposed dataset and online platform could serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of this research field. The proposed platform and dataset as well as the collected methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are publicly available and will be regularly updated.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging deep learning models are often large and complex, requiring specialized hardware to train and evaluate these models. To address such issues, we propose the PocketNet paradigm to reduce the size of deep learning models by throttling the growth of the number of channels in convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate that, for a range of segmentation and classification tasks, PocketNet architectures produce results comparable to that of conventional neural networks while reducing the number of parameters by multiple orders of magnitude, using up to 90% less GPU memory, and speeding up training times by up to 40%, thereby allowing such models to be trained and deployed in resource-constrained settings.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving systems need to handle complex scenarios such as lane following, avoiding collisions, taking turns, and responding to traffic signals. In recent years, approaches based on end-to-end behavioral cloning have demonstrated remarkable performance in point-to-point navigational scenarios, using a realistic simulator and standard benchmarks. Offline imitation learning is readily available, as it does not require expensive hand annotation or interaction with the target environment, but it is difficult to obtain a reliable system. In addition, existing methods have not specifically addressed the learning of reaction for traffic lights, which are a rare occurrence in the training datasets. Inspired by the previous work on multi-task learning and attention modeling, we propose a novel multi-task attention-aware network in the conditional imitation learning (CIL) framework. This does not only improve the success rate of standard benchmarks, but also the ability to react to traffic lights, which we show with standard benchmarks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work, we propose \textit{MVFuseNet}, a novel end-to-end method for joint object detection and motion forecasting from a temporal sequence of LiDAR data. Most existing methods operate in a single view by projecting data in either range view (RV) or bird's eye view (BEV). In contrast, we propose a method that effectively utilizes both RV and BEV for spatio-temporal feature learning as part of a temporal fusion network as well as for multi-scale feature learning in the backbone network. Further, we propose a novel sequential fusion approach that effectively utilizes multiple views in the temporal fusion network. We show the benefits of our multi-view approach for the tasks of detection and motion forecasting on two large-scale self-driving data sets, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we show that MVFusenet scales well to large operating ranges while maintaining real-time performance.

- **Summary**: This study focuses on automatic skin cancer detection using a Meta-learning approach for dermoscopic images. The aim of this study is to explore the benefits of the generalization of the knowledge extracted from non-medical data in the classification performance of medical data and the impact of the distribution shift problem within limited data by using a simple class and distribution balancer algorithm. In this study, a small sample of a combined dataset from 3 different sources was used to fine-tune a ResNet model pre-trained on non-medical data. The results show an increase in performance on detecting melanoma, malignant (skin cancer), and benign moles with the prior knowledge obtained from images of everyday objects from the ImageNet dataset by 20 points. These findings suggest that features from non-medical images can be used towards the classification of skin moles and that the distribution of the data affects the performance of the model.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection based on LiDAR point clouds is a crucial module in autonomous driving particularly for long range sensing. Most of the research is focused on achieving higher accuracy and these models are not optimized for deployment on embedded systems from the perspective of latency and power efficiency. For high speed driving scenarios, latency is a crucial parameter as it provides more time to react to dangerous situations. Typically a voxel or point-cloud based 3D convolution approach is utilized for this module. Firstly, they are inefficient on embedded platforms as they are not suitable for efficient parallelization. Secondly, they have a variable runtime due to level of sparsity of the scene which is against the determinism needed in a safety system. In this work, we aim to develop a very low latency algorithm with fixed runtime. We propose a novel semantic segmentation architecture as a single unified model for object center detection using key points, box predictions and orientation prediction using binned classification in a simpler Bird's Eye View (BEV) 2D representation. The proposed architecture can be trivially extended to include semantic segmentation classes like road without any additional computation. The proposed model has a latency of 4 ms on the embedded Nvidia Xavier platform. The model is 5X faster than other top accuracy models with a minimal accuracy degradation of 2% in Average Precision at IoU=0.5 on KITTI dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we tackle two important problems in low-rank learning, which are partial singular value decomposition and numerical rank estimation of huge matrices. By using the concepts of Krylov subspaces such as Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization (GK-bidiagonalization) as well as Ritz vectors, we propose two methods for solving these problems in a fast and accurate way. Our experiments show the advantages of the proposed methods compared to the traditional and randomized singular value decomposition methods. The proposed methods are appropriate for applications involving huge matrices where the accuracy of the desired singular values and also all of their corresponding singular vectors are essential. As a real application, we evaluate the performance of our methods on the problem of Riemannian similarity learning between two various image datasets of MNIST and USPS.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is a key component of CNN based image recognition tasks like object detection. However, it is relatively less explored for 3D object detection. Many standard 2D object detection data augmentation techniques do not extend to 3D box. Extension of these data augmentations for 3D object detection requires adaptation of the 3D geometry of the input scene and synthesis of new viewpoints. This requires accurate depth information of the scene which may not be always available. In this paper, we evaluate existing 2D data augmentations and propose two novel augmentations for monocular 3D detection without a requirement for novel view synthesis. We evaluate these augmentations on the RTM3D detection model firstly due to the shorter training times . We obtain a consistent improvement by 4% in the 3D AP (@IoU=0.7) for cars, ~1.8% scores 3D AP (@IoU=0.25) for pedestrians & cyclists, over the baseline on KITTI car detection dataset. We also demonstrate a rigorous evaluation of the mAP scores by re-weighting them to take into account the class imbalance in the KITTI validation dataset.

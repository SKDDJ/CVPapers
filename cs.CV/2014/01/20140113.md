- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an algorithm to automatically detect meaningful modes in a histogram. The proposed method is based on the behavior of local minima in a scale-space representation. We show that the detection of such meaningful modes is equivalent in a two classes clustering problem on the length of minima scale-space curves. The algorithm is easy to implement, fast, and does not require any parameters. We present several results on histogram and spectrum segmentation, grayscale image segmentation and color image reduction.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses a new learning algorithm for the recently introduced co-sparse analysis model. First, we give new insights into the co-sparse analysis model by establishing connections to filter-based MRF models, such as the Field of Experts (FoE) model of Roth and Black. For training, we introduce a technique called bi-level optimization to learn the analysis operators. Compared to existing analysis operator learning approaches, our training procedure has the advantage that it is unconstrained with respect to the analysis operator. We investigate the effect of different aspects of the co-sparse analysis model and show that the sparsity promoting function (also called penalty function) is the most important factor in the model. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our training approach, we apply our trained models to various classical image restoration problems. Numerical experiments show that our trained models clearly outperform existing analysis operator learning approaches and are on par with state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms. Our approach develops a framework that is intuitive to understand and easy to implement.

- **Summary**: We present a statistical model for $3$D human faces in varying expression, which decomposes the surface of the face using a wavelet transform, and learns many localized, decorrelated multilinear models on the resulting coefficients. Using this model we are able to reconstruct faces from noisy and occluded $3$D face scans, and facial motion sequences. Accurate reconstruction of face shape is important for applications such as tele-presence and gaming. The localized and multi-scale nature of our model allows for recovery of fine-scale detail while retaining robustness to severe noise and occlusion, and is computationally efficient and scalable. We validate these properties experimentally on challenging data in the form of static scans and motion sequences. We show that in comparison to a global multilinear model, our model better preserves fine detail and is computationally faster, while in comparison to a localized PCA model, our model better handles variation in expression, is faster, and allows us to fix identity parameters for a given subject.

- **Summary**: One of the main purposes of earth observation is to extract interested information and knowledge from remote sensing (RS) images with high efficiency and accuracy. However, with the development of RS technologies, RS system provide images with higher spatial and temporal resolution and more spectral channels than before, and it is inefficient and almost impossible to manually interpret these images. Thus, it is of great interests to explore automatic and intelligent algorithms to quickly process such massive RS data with high accuracy. This thesis targets to develop some efficient information extraction algorithms for RS images, by relying on the advanced technologies in machine learning. More precisely, we adopt the manifold learning algorithms as the mainline and unify the regularization theory, tensor-based method, sparse learning and transfer learning into the same framework. The main contributions of this thesis are as follows.

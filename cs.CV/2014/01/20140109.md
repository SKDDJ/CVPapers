- **Summary**: The L1-norm of the gradient-magnitude images (GMI), which is the well-known total variation (TV) model, is widely used as regularization in the few views CT reconstruction. As the L1-norm TV regularization is tending to uniformly penalize the image gradient and the low-contrast structures are sometimes over smoothed, we proposed a new algorithm based on the L0-norm of the GMI to deal with the few views problem. To rise to the challenges introduced by the L0-norm DGT, the algorithm uses a pseudo-inverse transform of DGT and adapts an iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm, whose convergence and effective efficiency have been theoretically proven. The simulation indicates that the algorithm proposed in this paper can obviously improve the reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Precise 3D measurements of rigid surfaces are desired in many fields of application like quality control or surgery. Often, views from all around the object have to be acquired for a full 3D description of the object surface. We present a sensor principle called "Flying Triangulation" which avoids an elaborate "stop-and-go" procedure. It combines a low-cost classical light-section sensor with an algorithmic pipeline. A hand-guided sensor captures a continuous movie of 3D views while being moved around the object. The views are automatically aligned and the acquired 3D model is displayed in real time. In contrast to most existing sensors no bandwidth is wasted for spatial or temporal encoding of the projected lines. Nor is an expensive color camera necessary for 3D acquisition. The achievable measurement uncertainty and lateral resolution of the generated 3D data is merely limited by physics. An alternating projection of vertical and horizontal lines guarantees the existence of corresponding points in successive 3D views. This enables a precise registration without surface interpolation. For registration, a variant of the iterative closest point algorithm - adapted to the specific nature of our 3D views - is introduced. Furthermore, data reduction and smoothing without losing lateral resolution as well as the acquisition and mapping of a color texture is presented. The precision and applicability of the sensor is demonstrated by simulation and measurement results.

- **Summary**: Due to the increasingly need for automatic traffic monitoring, vehicle license plate detection is of high interest to perform automatic toll collection, traffic law enforcement, parking lot access control, among others. In this paper, a sliding window approach based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features is used for Brazilian license plate detection. This approach consists in scanning the whole image in a multiscale fashion such that the license plate is located precisely. The main contribution of this work consists in a deep study of the best setup for HOG descriptors on the detection of Brazilian license plates, in which HOG have never been applied before. We also demonstrate the reliability of this method ensured by a recall higher than 98% (with a precision higher than 78%) in a publicly available data set.

- **Summary**: Road region recognition is a main feature that is gaining increasing attention from intellectuals because it helps autonomous vehicle to achieve a successful navigation without accident. However, different techniques based on camera sensor have been used by various researchers and outstanding results have been achieved. Despite their success, environmental noise like shadow leads to inaccurate recognition of road region which eventually leads to accident for autonomous vehicle. In this research, we conducted an investigation on shadow and its effects, optimized the road region recognition system of autonomous vehicle by introducing an algorithm capable of detecting and eliminating the effects of shadow. The experimental performance of our system was tested and compared using the following schemes: Total Positive Rate (TPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), Total Negative Rate (TNR), Error Rate (ERR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). The performance result of the system improved on road recognition in shadow scenario and this advancement has added tremendously to successful navigation approaches for autonomous vehicle.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the maneuver of mouse pointer and performs various mouse operations such as left click, right click, double click, drag etc using gestures recognition technique. Recognizing gestures is a complex task which involves many aspects such as motion modeling, motion analysis, pattern recognition and machine learning. Keeping all the essential factors in mind a system has been created which recognizes the movement of fingers and various patterns formed by them. Color caps have been used for fingers to distinguish it from the background color such as skin color. Thus recognizing the gestures various mouse events have been performed. The application has been created on MATLAB environment with operating system as windows 7.

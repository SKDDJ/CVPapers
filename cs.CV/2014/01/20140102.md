- **Summary**: Hybrid approach has a special status among Face Recognition Systems as they combine different recognition approaches in an either serial or parallel to overcome the shortcomings of individual methods. This paper explores the area of Hybrid Face Recognition using score based strategy as a combiner/fusion process. In proposed approach, the recognition system operates in two modes: training and classification. Training mode involves normalization of the face images (training set), extracting appropriate features using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The extracted features are then trained in parallel using Back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) to partition the feature space in to different face classes. In classification mode, the trained PCA BPNN and ICA BPNN are fed with new face image(s). The score based strategy which works as a combiner is applied to the results of both PCA BPNN and ICA BPNN to classify given new face image(s) according to face classes obtained during the training mode. The proposed approach has been tested on ORL and other face databases; the experimented results show that the proposed system has higher accuracy than face recognition systems using single feature extractor.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a hybrid NN/HMM model for online Arabic handwriting recognition. The proposed system is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs). The input signal is segmented to continuous strokes called segments based on the Beta-Elliptical strategy by inspecting the extremum points of the curvilinear velocity profile. A neural network trained with segment level contextual information is used to extract class character probabilities. The output of this network is decoded by HMMs to provide character level recognition. In evaluations on the ADAB database, we achieved 96.4% character recognition accuracy that is statistically significantly important in comparison with character recognition accuracies obtained from state-of-the-art online Arabic systems.8

- **Comment**: There were several errors in the experimental section which we are
  looking into
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Automatic authentication of paper money has been targeted. Indian bank notes are taken as reference to show how a system can be developed for discriminating fake notes from genuine ones. Image processing and pattern recognition techniques are used to design the overall approach. The ability of the embedded security aspects is thoroughly analysed for detecting fake currencies. Real forensic samples are involved in the experiment that shows a high precision machine can be developed for authentication of paper money. The system performance is reported in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. Comparison with human subjects namely forensic experts and bank staffs clearly shows its applicability for mass checking of currency notes in the real world. The analysis of security features to protect counterfeiting highlights some facts that should be taken care of in future designing of currency notes.

- **Summary**: Transmission imaging, as an important imaging technique widely used in astronomy, medical diagnosis, and biology science, has been shown in [49] quite different from reflection imaging used in our everyday life. Understanding the structures of images (the prior information) is important for designing, testing, and choosing image processing methods, and good image processing methods are helpful for further uses of the image data, e.g., increasing the accuracy of the object reconstruction methods in transmission imaging applications. In reflection imaging, the images are usually modeled as discontinuous functions and even piecewise constant functions. In transmission imaging, it was shown very recently in [49] that almost all images are continuous functions. However, the author in [49] considered only the case of parallel beam geometry and used some too strong assumptions in the proof, which exclude some common cases such as cylindrical objects. In this paper, we consider more general beam geometries and simplify the assumptions by using totally different techniques. In particular, we will prove that almost all images in transmission imaging with both parallel and divergent beam geometries (two most typical beam geometries) are continuous functions, under much weaker assumptions than those in [49], which admit almost all practical cases. Besides, taking into accounts our analysis, we compare two image processing methods for Poisson noise (which is the most significant noise in transmission imaging) removal. Numerical experiments will be provided to demonstrate our analysis.

  Nonparametrics
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this publication, we combine two Bayesian non-parametric models: the Gaussian Process (GP) and the Dirichlet Process (DP). Our innovation in the GP model is to introduce a variation on the GP prior which enables us to model structured time-series data, i.e. data containing groups where we wish to model inter- and intra-group variability. Our innovation in the DP model is an implementation of a new fast collapsed variational inference procedure which enables us to optimize our variationala pproximation significantly faster than standard VB approaches. In a biological time series application we show how our model better captures salient features of the data, leading to better consistency with existing biological classifications, while the associated inference algorithm provides a twofold speed-up over EM-based variational inference.

- **Summary**: In this paper the Modified Fractal Signature method is applied to real Synthetic Aperture Radar images provided to our research group by SET 163 Working Group on SAR radar techniques. This method uses the blanket technique to provide useful information for SAR image classification. It is based on the calculation of the volume of a blanket, corresponding to the image to be classified, and then on the calculation of the corresponding Fractal Area curve and Fractal Dimension curve of the image. The main idea concerning this proposed technique is the fact that different terrain types encountered in SAR images yield different values of Fractal Area curves and Fractal Dimension curves, upon which classification of different types of terrain is possible. As a result, a classification technique for five different terrain types, i.e. urban, suburban, rural, mountain and sea, is presented in this paper.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present the efficient content based image retrieval systems which employ the color, texture and shape information of images to facilitate the retrieval process. For efficient feature extraction, we extract the color, texture and shape feature of images automatically using edge detection which is widely used in signal processing and image compression. For facilitated the speedy retrieval we are implements the antipole-tree algorithm for indexing the images.

- **Summary**: We describe a completely automated large scale visual recommendation system for fashion. Our focus is to efficiently harness the availability of large quantities of online fashion images and their rich meta-data. Specifically, we propose four data driven models in the form of Complementary Nearest Neighbor Consensus, Gaussian Mixture Models, Texture Agnostic Retrieval and Markov Chain LDA for solving this problem. We analyze relative merits and pitfalls of these algorithms through extensive experimentation on a large-scale data set and baseline them against existing ideas from color science. We also illustrate key fashion insights learned through these experiments and show how they can be employed to design better recommendation systems. Finally, we also outline a large-scale annotated data set of fashion images (Fashion-136K) that can be exploited for future vision research.

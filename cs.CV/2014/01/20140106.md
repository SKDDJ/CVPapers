- **Summary**: Extraction and recognition of Bangla text from video frame images is challenging due to complex color background, low-resolution etc. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for extraction and recognition of Bangla text form such video frames with complex background. Here, a two-step approach has been proposed. First, the text line is segmented into words using information based on line contours. First order gradient value of the text blocks are used to find the word gap. Next, a local binarization technique is applied on each word and text line is reconstructed using those words. Secondly, this binarized text block is sent to OCR for recognition purpose.

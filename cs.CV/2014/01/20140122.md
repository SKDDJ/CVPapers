- **Summary**: We now know that mid-level features can greatly enhance the performance of image learning, but how to automatically learn the image features efficiently and in an unsupervised manner is still an open question. In this paper, we present a very efficient mid-level feature learning approach (MidFea), which only involves simple operations such as $k$-means clustering, convolution, pooling, vector quantization and random projection. We explain why this simple method generates the desired features, and argue that there is no need to spend much time in learning low-level feature extractors. Furthermore, to boost the performance, we propose to model the neuron selectivity (NS) principle by building an additional layer over the mid-level features before feeding the features into the classifier. We show that the NS-layer learns category-specific neurons with both bottom-up inference and top-down analysis, and thus supports fast inference for a query image. We run extensive experiments on several public databases to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performances for face recognition, gender classification, age estimation and object categorization. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach is more than an order of magnitude faster than some recently proposed sparse coding based methods.

- **Summary**: Most vehicle license plate recognition use neural network techniques to enhance its computing capability. The image of the vehicle license plate is captured and processed to produce a textual output for further processing. This paper reviews image processing and neural network techniques applied at different stages which are preprocessing, filtering, feature extraction, segmentation and recognition in such way to remove the noise of the image, to enhance the image quality and to expedite the computing process by converting the characters in the image into respective text. An exemplar experiment has been done in MATLAB to show the basic process of the image processing especially for license plate in Malaysia case study. An algorithm is adapted into the solution for parking management system. The solution then is implemented as proof of concept to the algorithm.

- **Summary**: Our visual system is astonishingly efficient at detecting moving objects. This process is mediated by the neurons which connect the primary visual cortex (V1) to the middle temporal (MT) area. Interestingly, since Kuffler's pioneering experiments on retinal ganglion cells, mathematical models have been vital for advancing our understanding of the receptive fields of visual neurons. However, existing models were not designed to describe the most salient attributes of the highly specialized neurons in the V1 to MT motion processing stream; and they have not been able to do so. Here, we introduce the Gabor-Einstein wavelet, a new family of functions for representing the receptive fields of V1 to MT neurons. We show that the way space and time are mixed in the visual cortex is analogous to the way they are mixed in the special theory of relativity (STR). Hence we constrained the Gabor-Einstein model by requiring: (i) relativistic-invariance of the wave carrier, and (ii) the minimum possible number of parameters. From these two constraints, the sinc function emerged as a natural descriptor of the wave carrier. The particular distribution of lowpass to bandpass temporal frequency filtering properties of V1 to MT neurons (Foster et al 1985; DeAngelis et al 1993b; Hawken et al 1996) is clearly explained by the Gabor-Einstein basis. Furthermore, it does so in a manner innately representative of the motion-processing stream's neuronal hierarchy. Our analysis and computer simulations show that the distribution of temporal frequency filtering properties along the motion processing stream is a direct effect of the way the brain jointly encodes space and time. We uncovered this fundamental link by demonstrating that analogous mathematical structures underlie STR and joint cortical spacetime encoding. This link will provide new physiological insights into how the brain represents visual information.

- **Summary**: In this paper we address the issues of using edge detection techniques on facial images to produce cancellable biometric templates and a novel method for template verification against tampering. With increasing use of biometrics, there is a real threat for the conventional systems using face databases, which store images of users in raw and unaltered form. If compromised not only it is irrevocable, but can be misused for cross-matching across different databases. So it is desirable to generate and store revocable templates for the same user in different applications to prevent cross-matching and to enhance security, while maintaining privacy and ethics. By comparing different edge detection methods it has been observed that the edge detection based on the Roberts Cross operator performs consistently well across multiple face datasets, in which the face images have been taken under a variety of conditions. We have proposed a novel scheme using hashing, for extra verification, in order to harden the security of the stored biometric templates.

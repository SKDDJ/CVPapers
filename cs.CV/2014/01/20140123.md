- **Summary**: In the paper a piecewise constant image approximations of sequential number of pixel clusters or segments are treated. A majorizing of optimal approximation sequence by hierarchical sequence of image approximations is studied. Transition from pixel clustering to image segmentation by reducing of segment numbers in clusters is provided. Algorithms are proved by elementary formulas.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method for image block loss restoration based on the notion of sparse representation. We use the sparsity pattern as side information to efficiently restore block losses by iteratively imposing the constraints of spatial and transform domains on the corrupted image. Two novel features, including a pre-interpolation and a criterion for stopping the iterations, are proposed to improve the performance. Also, to deal with practical applications, we develop a technique to transmit the side information along with the image. In this technique, we first compress the side information and then embed its LDPC coded version in the least significant bits of the image pixels. This technique ensures the error-free transmission of the side information, while causing only a small perturbation on the transmitted image. Mathematical analysis and extensive simulations are performed to validate the method and investigate the efficiency of the proposed techniques. The results verify that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts for image block loss restoration.

- **Summary**: Background modeling is a critical component for various vision-based applications. Most traditional methods tend to be inefficient when solving large-scale problems. In this paper, we introduce sparse representation into the task of large scale stable background modeling, and reduce the video size by exploring its 'discriminative' frames. A cyclic iteration process is then proposed to extract the background from the discriminative frame set. The two parts combine to form our Sparse Outlier Iterative Removal (SOIR) algorithm. The algorithm operates in tensor space to obey the natural data structure of videos. Experimental results show that a few discriminative frames determine the performance of the background extraction. Further, SOIR can achieve high accuracy and high speed simultaneously when dealing with real video sequences. Thus, SOIR has an advantage in solving large-scale tasks.

- **Summary**: The connectivity and structural integrity of the white matter of the brain is nowadays known to be implicated into a wide range of brain-related disorders. However, it was not before the advent of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) that researches have been able to examine the properties of white matter in vivo. Presently, among a range of various methods of dMRI, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is known to excel in its ability to provide reliable information about the local orientations of neural fasciculi (aka fibre tracts). Moreover, as opposed to the more traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), HARDI is capable of distinguishing the orientations of multiple fibres passing through a given spatial voxel. Unfortunately, the ability of HARDI to discriminate between neural fibres that cross each other at acute angles is always limited, which is the main reason behind the development of numerous post-processing tools, aiming at the improvement of the directional resolution of HARDI. Among such tools is spherical deconvolution (SD). Due to its ill-posed nature, however, SD standardly relies on a number of a priori assumptions which are to render its results unique and stable. In this paper, we propose a different approach to the problem of SD in HARDI, which accounts for the spatial continuity of neural fibres as well as the presence of isotropic diffusion. Subsequently, we demonstrate how the proposed solution can be used to successfully overcome the effect of partial voluming, while preserving the spatial coherency of cerebral diffusion at moderate-to-severe noise levels. In a series of both in silico and in vivo experiments, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of several available alternatives, with the comparative results clearly supporting the viability and usefulness of our approach.

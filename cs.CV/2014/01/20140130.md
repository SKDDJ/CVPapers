- **Summary**: Compact and discriminative visual codebooks are preferred in many visual recognition tasks. In the literature, a number of works have taken the approach of hierarchically merging visual words of an initial large-sized codebook, but implemented this approach with different merging criteria. In this work, we propose a single probabilistic framework to unify these merging criteria, by identifying two key factors: the function used to model class-conditional distribution and the method used to estimate the distribution parameters. More importantly, by adopting new distribution functions and/or parameter estimation methods, our framework can readily produce a spectrum of novel merging criteria. Three of them are specifically focused in this work. In the first criterion, we adopt the multinomial distribution with Bayesian method; In the second criterion, we integrate Gaussian distribution with maximum likelihood parameter estimation. In the third criterion, which shows the best merging performance, we propose a max-margin-based parameter estimation method and apply it with multinomial distribution. Extensive experimental study is conducted to systematically analyse the performance of the above three criteria and compare them with existing ones. As demonstrated, the best criterion obtained in our framework achieves the overall best merging performance among the comparable merging criteria developed in the literature.

- **Summary**: We present a video compressive sensing framework, termed kt-CSLDS, to accelerate the image acquisition process of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We are inspired by a state-of-the-art model for video compressive sensing that utilizes a linear dynamical system (LDS) to model the motion manifold. Given compressive measurements, the state sequence of an LDS can be first estimated using system identification techniques. We then reconstruct the observation matrix using a joint structured sparsity assumption. In particular, we minimize an objective function with a mixture of wavelet sparsity and joint sparsity within the observation matrix. We derive an efficient convex optimization algorithm through alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and provide a theoretical guarantee for global convergence. We demonstrate the performance of our approach for video compressive sensing, in terms of reconstruction accuracy. We also investigate the impact of various sampling strategies. We apply this framework to accelerate the acquisition process of dynamic MRI and show it achieves the best reconstruction accuracy with the least computational time compared with existing algorithms in the literature.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways to extract meaningful features. One common approach is to perform edge detection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact that these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object foreground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be combined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively select threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature selection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote sensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three characteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection and reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics analysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction accuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding an image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of classification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of thresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of remote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive thresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our solution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image. Additionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective algorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for preprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable tool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the classification procedure.

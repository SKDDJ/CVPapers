- **Summary**: Automatic face recognition is an area with immense practical potential which includes a wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications. Hence it is unsurprising that it continues to be one of the most active research areas of computer vision. Even after over three decades of intense research, the state-of-the-art in face recognition continues to improve, benefitting from advances in a range of different research fields such as image processing, pattern recognition, computer graphics, and physiology. Systems based on visible spectrum images, the most researched face recognition modality, have reached a significant level of maturity with some practical success. However, they continue to face challenges in the presence of illumination, pose and expression changes, as well as facial disguises, all of which can significantly decrease recognition accuracy. Amongst various approaches which have been proposed in an attempt to overcome these limitations, the use of infrared (IR) imaging has emerged as a particularly promising research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive and timely review of the literature on this subject. Our key contributions are: (i) a summary of the inherent properties of infrared imaging which makes this modality promising in the context of face recognition, (ii) a systematic review of the most influential approaches, with a focus on emerging common trends as well as key differences between alternative methodologies, (iii) a description of the main databases of infrared facial images available to the researcher, and lastly (iv) a discussion of the most promising avenues for future research.

- **Summary**: This work presents a general framework for solving the low rank and/or sparse matrix minimization problems, which may involve multiple non-smooth terms. The Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method is a fast solver, which smooths the objective function and minimizes it by alternately updating the variables and their weights. However, the traditional IRLS can only solve a sparse only or low rank only minimization problem with squared loss or an affine constraint. This work generalizes IRLS to solve joint/mixed low rank and sparse minimization problems, which are essential formulations for many tasks. As a concrete example, we solve the Schatten-$p$ norm and $\ell_{2,q}$-norm regularized Low-Rank Representation (LRR) problem by IRLS, and theoretically prove that the derived solution is a stationary point (globally optimal if $p,q\geq1$). Our convergence proof of IRLS is more general than previous one which depends on the special properties of the Schatten-$p$ norm and $\ell_{2,q}$-norm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that our IRLS is much more efficient.

- **Summary**: These days to gain classification system with high accuracy that can classify complicated pattern are so useful in medicine and industry. In this article a process for getting the best classifier for Lasik data is suggested. However at first it's been tried to find the best line and curve by this classifier in order to gain classifier fitting, and in the end by using the Markov method a classifier for topographies is gained.

- **Summary**: The paper is devoted to the problem of integer-valued estimating of information quantity in a pixel of digital image. The definition of an integer estimation of information quantity based on constructing of the certain binary hierarchy of pixel clusters is proposed. The methods for constructing hierarchies of clusters and generating of hierarchical sequences of image approximations that minimally differ from the image by a standard deviation are developed. Experimental results on integer-valued estimation of information quantity are compared with the results obtained by utilizing of the classical formulas.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of exact and inexact matching of weighted undirected graphs, in which a bijective correspondence is sought to minimize a quadratic weight disagreement. This computationally challenging problem is often relaxed as a convex quadratic program, in which the space of permutations is replaced by the space of doubly-stochastic matrices. However, the applicability of such a relaxation is poorly understood. We define a broad class of friendly graphs characterized by an easily verifiable spectral property. We prove that for friendly graphs, the convex relaxation is guaranteed to find the exact isomorphism or certify its inexistence. This result is further extended to approximately isomorphic graphs, for which we develop an explicit bound on the amount of weight disagreement under which the relaxation is guaranteed to find the globally optimal approximate isomorphism. We also show that in many cases, the graph matching problem can be further harmlessly relaxed to a convex quadratic program with only n separable linear equality constraints, which is substantially more efficient than the standard relaxation involving 2n equality and n^2 inequality constraints. Finally, we show that our results are still valid for unfriendly graphs if additional information in the form of seeds or attributes is allowed, with the latter satisfying an easy to verify spectral characteristic.

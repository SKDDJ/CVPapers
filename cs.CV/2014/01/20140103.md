- **Summary**: We provide two novel adaptive-rate compressive sensing (CS) strategies for sparse, time-varying signals using side information. Our first method utilizes extra cross-validation measurements, and the second one exploits extra low-resolution measurements. Unlike the majority of current CS techniques, we do not assume that we know an upper bound on the number of significant coefficients that comprise the images in the video sequence. Instead, we use the side information to predict the number of significant coefficients in the signal at the next time instant. For each image in the video sequence, our techniques specify a fixed number of spatially-multiplexed CS measurements to acquire, and adjust this quantity from image to image. Our strategies are developed in the specific context of background subtraction for surveillance video, and we experimentally validate the proposed methods on real video sequences.

- **Summary**: Unusual events are important as being possible indicators of undesired consequences. Moreover, unusualness in everyday life activities may also be amusing to watch as proven by the popularity of such videos shared in social media. Discovery of unusual events in videos is generally attacked as a problem of finding usual patterns, and then separating the ones that do not resemble to those. In this study, we address the problem from the other side, and try to answer what type of patterns are shared among unusual videos that make them resemble to each other regardless of the ongoing event. With this challenging problem at hand, we propose a novel descriptor to encode the rapid motions in videos utilizing densely extracted trajectories. The proposed descriptor, which is referred to as trajectory snipped histograms, is used to distinguish unusual videos from usual videos, and further exploited to discover snapshots in which unusualness happen. Experiments on domain specific people falling videos and unrestricted funny videos show the effectiveness of our method in capturing unusualness.

- **Summary**: We introduce ConceptVision, a method that aims for high accuracy in categorizing large number of scenes, while keeping the model relatively simpler and efficient for scalability. The proposed method combines the advantages of both low-level representations and high-level semantic categories, and eliminates the distinctions between different levels through the definition of concepts. The proposed framework encodes the perspectives brought through different concepts by considering them in concept groups. Different perspectives are ensembled for the final decision. Extensive experiments are carried out on benchmark datasets to test the effects of different concepts, and methods used to ensemble. Comparisons with state-of-the-art studies show that we can achieve better results with incorporation of concepts in different levels with different perspectives.

- **Summary**: Face verification remains a challenging problem in very complex conditions with large variations such as pose, illumination, expression, and occlusions. This problem is exacerbated when we rely unrealistically on a single training data source, which is often insufficient to cover the intrinsically complex face variations. This paper proposes a principled multi-task learning approach based on Discriminative Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, named GaussianFace, to enrich the diversity of training data. In comparison to existing methods, our model exploits additional data from multiple source-domains to improve the generalization performance of face verification in an unknown target-domain. Importantly, our model can adapt automatically to complex data distributions, and therefore can well capture complex face variations inherent in multiple sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in learning from diverse data sources and generalize to unseen domain. Specifically, the accuracy of our algorithm achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 98.52% on the well-known and challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark. For the first time, the human-level performance in face verification (97.53%) on LFW is surpassed.

- **Summary**: Natural image matting, which separates foreground from background, is a very important intermediate step in recent computer vision algorithms. However, it is severely underconstrained and difficult to solve. State-of-the-art approaches include matting by graph Laplacian, which significantly improves the underconstrained nature by reducing the solution space. However, matting by graph Laplacian is still very difficult to solve and gets much harder as the image size grows: current iterative methods slow down as $\mathcal{O}\left(n^2 \right)$ in the resolution $n$. This creates uncomfortable practical limits on the resolution of images that we can matte. Current literature mitigates the problem, but they all remain super-linear in complexity. We expose properties of the problem that remain heretofore unexploited, demonstrating that an optimization technique originally intended to solve PDEs can be adapted to take advantage of this knowledge to solve the matting problem, not heuristically, but exactly and with sub-linear complexity. This makes ours the most efficient matting solver currently known by a very wide margin and allows matting finally to be practical and scalable in the future as consumer photos exceed many dozens of megapixels, and also relieves matting from being a bottleneck for vision algorithms that depend on it.

- **Summary**: Texture segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into regions with different textures containing a similar group of pixels. Detecting the discontinuity of the filter's output and their statistical properties help in segmenting and classifying a given image with different texture regions. In this proposed paper, chili x-ray image texture segmentation is performed by using Gabor filter. The texture segmented result obtained from Gabor filter fed into three texture filters, namely Entropy, Standard Deviation and Range filter. After performing texture analysis, features can be extracted by using Statistical methods. In this paper Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices and First order statistics are used as feature extraction methods. Features extracted from statistical methods are given to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Using this methodology, it is found that texture segmentation is followed by the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix feature extraction method gives a higher accuracy rate of 84% when compared with First order feature extraction method.   Key Words: Texture segmentation, Texture filter, Gabor filter, Feature extraction methods, SVM classifier.

- **Summary**: This is the first report on Working Paper WP-RFM-14-01. The potential and capability of sparse representations is well-known. However, their (multivariate variable) vectorial form, which is completely fine in many fields and disciplines, results in removal and filtering of important "spatial" relations that are implicitly carried by two-dimensional [or multi-dimensional] objects, such as images. In this paper, a new approach, called spiralet sparse representation, is proposed in order to develop an augmented representation and therefore a modified sparse representation and theory, which is capable to preserve the data associated to the spatial relations.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the concept of sparse bilinear logistic regression for decision problems involving explanatory variables that are two-dimensional matrices. Such problems are common in computer vision, brain-computer interfaces, style/content factorization, and parallel factor analysis. The underlying optimization problem is bi-convex; we study its solution and develop an efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent. We provide a theoretical guarantee for global convergence and estimate the asymptotical convergence rate using the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. A range of experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate that sparse bilinear logistic regression outperforms current techniques in several important applications.

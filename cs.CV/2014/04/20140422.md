- **Summary**: We identify a novel instance of the background subtraction problem that focuses on extracting near-field foreground objects captured using handheld cameras. Given two user-generated videos of a scene, one with and the other without the foreground object(s), our goal is to efficiently generate an output video with only the foreground object(s) present in it. We cast this challenge as a spatio-temporal frame matching problem, and propose an efficient solution for it that exploits the temporal smoothness of the video sequences. We present theoretical analyses for the error bounds of our approach, and validate our findings using a detailed set of simulation experiments. Finally, we present the results of our approach tested on multiple real videos captured using handheld cameras, and compare them to several alternate foreground extraction approaches.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel image set representation and classification method by maximizing the margin of image sets. The margin of an image set is defined as the difference of the distance to its nearest image set from different classes and the distance to its nearest image set of the same class. By modeling the image sets by using both their image samples and their affine hull models, and maximizing the margins of the images sets, the image set representation parameter learning problem is formulated as an minimization problem, which is further optimized by an expectation -maximization (EM) strategy with accelerated proximal gradient (APG) optimization in an iterative algorithm. To classify a given test image set, we assign it to the class which could provide the largest margin. Experiments on two applications of video-sequence-based face recognition demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image set classification methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

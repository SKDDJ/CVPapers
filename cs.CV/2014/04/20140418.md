- **Summary**: Online feature selection with dynamic features has become an active research area in recent years. However, in some real-world applications such as image analysis and email spam filtering, features may arrive by groups. Existing online feature selection methods evaluate features individually, while existing group feature selection methods cannot handle online processing. Motivated by this, we formulate the online group feature selection problem, and propose a novel selection approach for this problem. Our proposed approach consists of two stages: online intra-group selection and online inter-group selection. In the intra-group selection, we use spectral analysis to select discriminative features in each group when it arrives. In the inter-group selection, we use Lasso to select a globally optimal subset of features. This 2-stage procedure continues until there are no more features to come or some predefined stopping conditions are met. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark and real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art online feature selection methods.

- **Summary**: Sparse Representation (or coding) based Classification (SRC) has gained great success in face recognition in recent years. However, SRC emphasizes the sparsity too much and overlooks the correlation information which has been demonstrated to be critical in real-world face recognition problems. Besides, some work considers the correlation but overlooks the discriminative ability of sparsity. Different from these existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a framework called Adaptive Sparse Representation based Classification (ASRC) in which sparsity and correlation are jointly considered. Specifically, when the samples are of low correlation, ASRC selects the most discriminative samples for representation, like SRC; when the training samples are highly correlated, ASRC selects most of the correlated and discriminative samples for representation, rather than choosing some related samples randomly. In general, the representation model is adaptive to the correlation structure, which benefits from both $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_2$-norm.   Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available data sets verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper we study an algorithm for solving a minimization problem composed of a differentiable (possibly non-convex) and a convex (possibly non-differentiable) function. The algorithm iPiano combines forward-backward splitting with an inertial force. It can be seen as a non-smooth split version of the Heavy-ball method from Polyak. A rigorous analysis of the algorithm for the proposed class of problems yields global convergence of the function values and the arguments. This makes the algorithm robust for usage on non-convex problems. The convergence result is obtained based on the \KL inequality. This is a very weak restriction, which was used to prove convergence for several other gradient methods. First, an abstract convergence theorem for a generic algorithm is proved, and, then iPiano is shown to satisfy the requirements of this theorem. Furthermore, a convergence rate is established for the general problem class. We demonstrate iPiano on computer vision problems: image denoising with learned priors and diffusion based image compression.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes improved methods for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the equivalent number of looks $L$. This parameter has a meaningful interpretation in the context of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. Due to the presence of coherent illumination in their processing, PolSAR systems generate images which present a granular noise called speckle. As a potential solution for reducing such interference, the parameter $L$ controls the signal-noise ratio. Thus, the proposal of efficient estimation methodologies for $L$ has been sought. To that end, we consider firstly that a PolSAR image is well described by the scaled complex Wishart distribution. In recent years, Anfinsen et al. derived and analyzed estimation methods based on the ML and on trace statistical moments for obtaining the parameter $L$ of the unscaled version of such probability law. This paper generalizes that approach. We present the second-order bias expression proposed by Cox and Snell for the ML estimator of this parameter. Moreover, the formula of the profile likelihood modified by Barndorff-Nielsen in terms of $L$ is discussed. Such derivations yield two new ML estimators for the parameter $L$, which are compared to the estimators proposed by Anfinsen et al. The performance of these estimators is assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments, adopting three statistical measures as comparison criterion: the mean square error, the bias, and the coefficient of variation. Equivalently to the simulation study, an application to actual PolSAR data concludes that the proposed estimators outperform all the others in homogeneous scenarios.

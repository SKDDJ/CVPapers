- **Summary**: Block-based motion estimation (ME) and compensation (MC) techniques are widely used in modern video processing algorithms and compression systems. The great variety of video applications and devices results in numerous compression specifications. Specifically, there is a diversity of frame-rates and bit-rates. In this paper, we study the effect of frame-rate and compression bit-rate on block-based ME and MC as commonly utilized in inter-frame coding and frame-rate up conversion (FRUC). This joint examination yields a comprehensive foundation for comparing MC procedures in coding and FRUC. First, the video signal is modeled as a noisy translational motion of an image. Then, we theoretically model the motion-compensated prediction of an available and absent frames as in coding and FRUC applications, respectively. The theoretic MC-prediction error is further analyzed and its autocorrelation function is calculated for coding and FRUC applications. We show a linear relation between the variance of the MC-prediction error and temporal-distance. While the affecting distance in MC-coding is between the predicted and reference frames, MC-FRUC is affected by the distance between the available frames used for the interpolation. Moreover, the dependency in temporal-distance implies an inverse effect of the frame-rate. FRUC performance analysis considers the prediction error variance, since it equals to the mean-squared-error of the interpolation. However, MC-coding analysis requires the entire autocorrelation function of the error; hence, analytic simplicity is beneficial. Therefore, we propose two constructions of a separable autocorrelation function for prediction error in MC-coding. We conclude by comparing our estimations with experimental results.

- **Summary**: Similarity comparisons of the form "Is object a more similar to b than to c?" are useful for computer vision and machine learning applications. Unfortunately, an embedding of $n$ points is specified by $n^3$ triplets, making collecting every triplet an expensive task. In noticing this difficulty, other researchers have investigated more intelligent triplet sampling techniques, but they do not study their effectiveness or their potential drawbacks. Although it is important to reduce the number of collected triplets, it is also important to understand how best to display a triplet collection task to a user. In this work we explore an alternative display for collecting triplets and analyze the monetary cost and speed of the display. We propose best practices for creating cost effective human intelligence tasks for collecting triplets. We show that rather than changing the sampling algorithm, simple changes to the crowdsourcing UI can lead to much higher quality embeddings. We also provide a dataset as well as the labels collected from crowd workers.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel action recognition framework. The method uses pictorial structures and shrinkage optimized directed information assessment (SODA) coupled with Markov Random Fields called SODA+MRF to model the directional temporal dependency and bidirectional spatial dependency. As a variant of mutual information, directional information captures the directional information flow and temporal structure of video sequences across frames. Meanwhile, within each frame, Markov random fields are utilized to model the spatial relations among different parts of a human body and the body parts of different people. The proposed SODA+MRF model is robust to view point transformations and detect complex interactions accurately. We compare the proposed method against several baseline methods to highlight the effectiveness of the SODA+MRF model. We demonstrate that our algorithm has superior action recognition performance on the UCF action recognition dataset, the Olympic sports dataset and the collective activity dataset over several state-of-the-art methods.

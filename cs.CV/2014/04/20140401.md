- **Summary**: This paper presents an intelligent traffic monitoring system using wireless vision sensor network that captures and processes the real-time video image to obtain the traffic flow rate and vehicle speeds along different urban roadways. This system will display the traffic states on the front roadways that can guide the drivers to select the right way and avoid potential traffic congestions. On the other hand, it will also monitor the vehicle speeds and store the vehicle details, for those breaking the roadway speed limits, in its database. The real-time traffic data is processed by the Personal Computer (PC) at the sub roadway station and the traffic flow rate data is transmitted to the main roadway station Arduino 3G via email, where the data is extracted and traffic flow rate displayed.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an active approach for part-based object detection, which optimizes the order of part filter evaluations and the time at which to stop and make a prediction. Statistics, describing the part responses, are learned from training data and are used to formalize the part scheduling problem as an offline optimization. Dynamic programming is applied to obtain a policy, which balances the number of part evaluations with the classification accuracy. During inference, the policy is used as a look-up table to choose the part order and the stopping time based on the observed filter responses. The method is faster than cascade detection with deformable part models (which does not optimize the part order) with negligible loss in accuracy when evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2010 datasets.

- **Summary**: Multi-region segmentation algorithms often have the onus of incorporating complex anatomical knowledge representing spatial or geometric relationships between objects, and general-purpose methods of addressing this knowledge in an optimization-based manner have thus been lacking. This paper presents Generalized Hierarchical Max-Flow (GHMF) segmentation, which captures simple anatomical part-whole relationships in the form of an unconstrained hierarchy. Regularization can then be applied to both parts and wholes independently, allowing for spatial grouping and clustering of labels in a globally optimal convex optimization framework. For the purposes of ready integration into a variety of segmentation tasks, the hierarchies can be presented in run-time, allowing for the segmentation problem to be readily specified and alternatives explored without undue programming effort or recompilation.

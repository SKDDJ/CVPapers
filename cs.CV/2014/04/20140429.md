- **Summary**: A novel coding strategy for block-based compressive sens-ing named spatially directional predictive coding (SDPC) is proposed, which efficiently utilizes the intrinsic spatial cor-relation of natural images. At the encoder, for each block of compressive sensing (CS) measurements, the optimal pre-diction is selected from a set of prediction candidates that are generated by four designed directional predictive modes. Then, the resulting residual is processed by scalar quantiza-tion (SQ). At the decoder, the same prediction is added onto the de-quantized residuals to produce the quantized CS measurements, which is exploited for CS reconstruction. Experimental results substantiate significant improvements achieved by SDPC-plus-SQ in rate distortion performance as compared with SQ alone and DPCM-plus-SQ.

- **Summary**: Compressive Sensing (CS) theory shows that a signal can be decoded from many fewer measurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory, when the signal is sparse in some domain. Most of conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet, contourlet and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the nonstationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery via structural group sparse representation (SGSR) modeling, which enforces image sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously under a unified framework in an adaptive group domain, thus greatly confining the CS solution space. In addition, an efficient iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm based technique is developed to solve the above optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel CS recovery strategy achieves significant performance improvements over the current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits nice convergence.

- **Summary**: Code minimization provides a speed-up of the processing time of fringe projection based stereo sensors and possibly makes them real-time applicable. This paper reports a methodology which enables such sensors to completely omit Gray code or other additional code. Only a sequence of sinusoidal images is necessary. The code reduction is achieved by involvement of the projection unit into the measurement, double triangulation, and a precise projector calibration or significant projector calibration improvement, respectively.

- **Summary**: As surrogate functions of $L_0$-norm, many nonconvex penalty functions have been proposed to enhance the sparse vector recovery. It is easy to extend these nonconvex penalty functions on singular values of a matrix to enhance low-rank matrix recovery. However, different from convex optimization, solving the nonconvex low-rank minimization problem is much more challenging than the nonconvex sparse minimization problem. We observe that all the existing nonconvex penalty functions are concave and monotonically increasing on $[0,\infty)$. Thus their gradients are decreasing functions. Based on this property, we propose an Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) algorithm to solve the nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. IRNN iteratively solves a Weighted Singular Value Thresholding (WSVT) problem. By setting the weight vector as the gradient of the concave penalty function, the WSVT problem has a closed form solution. In theory, we prove that IRNN decreases the objective function value monotonically, and any limit point is a stationary point. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that IRNN enhances the low-rank matrix recovery compared with state-of-the-art convex algorithms.

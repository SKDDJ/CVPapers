- **Summary**: In air traffic management (ATM) all necessary operations (tactical planing, sector configuration, required staffing, runway configuration, routing of approaching aircrafts) rely on accurate measurements and predictions of the current weather situation. An essential basis of information is delivered by weather radar images (WXR), which, unfortunately, exhibit a vast amount of disturbances. Thus, the improvement of these datasets is the key factor for more accurate predictions of weather phenomena and weather conditions. Image processing methods based on texture analysis and geometric operators allow to identify regions including artefacts as well as zones of missing information. Correction of these zones is implemented by exploiting multi-spectral satellite data (Meteosat Second Generation). Results prove that the proposed system for artefact detection and data correction significantly improves the quality of WXR data and, thus, enables more reliable weather now- and forecast leading to increased ATM safety.

- **Summary**: Activity recognition in sport is an attractive field for computer vision research. Game, player and team analysis are of great interest and research topics within this field emerge with the goal of automated analysis. The very specific underlying rules of sports can be used as prior knowledge for the recognition task and present a constrained environment for evaluation. This paper describes recognition of single player activities in sport with special emphasis on volleyball. Starting from a per-frame player-centered activity recognition, we incorporate geometry and contextual information via an activity context descriptor that collects information about all player's activities over a certain timespan relative to the investigated player. The benefit of this context information on single player activity recognition is evaluated on our new real-life dataset presenting a total amount of almost 36k annotated frames containing 7 activity classes within 6 videos of professional volleyball games. Our incorporation of the contextual information improves the average player-centered classification performance of 77.56% by up to 18.35% on specific classes, proving that spatio-temporal context is an important clue for activity recognition.

- **Summary**: A pseudo-Boolean function is a real-valued function $f(x)=f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ of $n$ binary variables; that is, a mapping from $\{0,1\}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$. For a pseudo-Boolean function $f(x)$ on $\{0,1\}^n$, we say that $g(x,y)$ is a quadratization of $f$ if $g(x,y)$ is a quadratic polynomial depending on $x$ and on $m$ auxiliary binary variables $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_m$ such that $f(x)= \min \{g(x,y) : y \in \{0,1\}^m \}$ for all $x \in \{0,1\}^n$. By means of quadratizations, minimization of $f$ is reduced to minimization (over its extended set of variables) of the quadratic function $g(x,y)$. This is of some practical interest because minimization of quadratic functions has been thoroughly studied for the last few decades, and much progress has been made in solving such problems exactly or heuristically. A related paper \cite{ABCG} initiated a systematic study of the minimum number of auxiliary $y$-variables required in a quadratization of an arbitrary function $f$ (a natural question, since the complexity of minimizing the quadratic function $g(x,y)$ depends, among other factors, on the number of binary variables). In this paper, we determine more precisely the number of auxiliary variables required by quadratizations of symmetric pseudo-Boolean functions $f(x)$, those functions whose value depends only on the Hamming weight of the input $x$ (the number of variables equal to $1$).

- **Summary**: We survey current term-wise techniques for quadratizing high-degree pseudo-Boolean functions and introduce a new one, which allows multiple splits of terms. We also introduce the first aggregative approach, which splits a collection of terms based on their common parts.

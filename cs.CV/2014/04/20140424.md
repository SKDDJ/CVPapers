- **Summary**: Current automatic vision systems face two major challenges: scalability and extreme variability of appearance. First, the computational time required to process an image typically scales linearly with the number of pixels in the image, therefore limiting the resolution of input images to thumbnail size. Second, variability in appearance and pose of the objects constitute a major hurdle for robust recognition and detection. In this work, we propose a model that makes baby steps towards addressing these challenges. We describe a learning based method that recognizes objects through a series of glimpses. This system performs an amount of computation that scales with the complexity of the input rather than its number of pixels. Moreover, the proposed method is potentially more robust to changes in appearance since its parameters are learned in a data driven manner. Preliminary experiments on a handwritten dataset of digits demonstrate the computational advantages of this approach.

- **Summary**: Correlation Filters (CFs) are a class of classifiers which are designed for accurate pattern localization. Traditionally CFs have been used with scalar features only, which limits their ability to be used with vector feature representations like Gabor filter banks, SIFT, HOG, etc. In this paper we present a new CF named Maximum Margin Vector Correlation Filter (MMVCF) which extends the traditional CF designs to vector features. MMVCF further combines the generalization capability of large margin based classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the localization properties of CFs for better robustness to outliers. We demonstrate the efficacy of MMVCF for object detection and landmark localization on a variety of databases and demonstrate that MMVCF consistently shows improved pattern localization capability in comparison to SVMs.

- **Summary**: This article introduces a full mathematical and numerical framework for treating functional shapes (or fshapes) following the landmarks of shape spaces and shape analysis. Functional shapes can be described as signal functions supported on varying geometrical supports. Analysing variability of fshapes' ensembles require the modelling and quantification of joint variations in geometry and signal, which have been treated separately in previous approaches. Instead, building on the ideas of shape spaces for purely geometrical objects, we propose the extended concept of fshape bundles and define Riemannian metrics for fshape metamorphoses to model geometrico-functional transformations within these bundles. We also generalize previous works on data attachment terms based on the notion of varifolds and demonstrate the utility of these distances. Based on these, we propose variational formulations of the atlas estimation problem on populations of fshapes and prove existence of solutions for the different models. The second part of the article examines the numerical implementation of the models by detailing discrete expressions for the metrics and gradients and proposing an optimization scheme for the atlas estimation problem. We present a few results of the methodology on a synthetic dataset as well as on a population of retinal membranes with thickness maps.

- **Summary**: We present algebraic projective geometry definitions of 3D rotations so as to bridge a small gap between the applications and the definitions of 3D rotations in homogeneous matrix form. A general homogeneous matrix formulation to 3D rotation geometric transformations is proposed which suits for the cases when the rotation axis is unnecessarily through the coordinate system origin given their rotation axes and rotation angles.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an unsupervised technique to detect the changed region of multitemporal images on a same reference plane with the help of rough clustering. The proposed technique is a soft-computing approach, based on the concept of rough set with rough clustering and Pawlak's accuracy. It is less noisy and avoids pre-deterministic knowledge about the distribution of the changed and unchanged regions. To show the effectiveness, the proposed technique is compared with some other approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper represents an text extraction method from Google maps, GIS maps/images. Due to an unsupervised approach there is no requirement of any prior knowledge or training set about the textual and non-textual parts. Fuzzy CMeans clustering technique is used for image segmentation and Prewitt method is used to detect the edges. Connected component analysis and gridding technique enhance the correctness of the results. The proposed method reaches 98.5% accuracy level on the basis of experimental data sets.

- **Summary**: Classifying large-scale image data into object categories is an important problem that has received increasing research attention. Given the huge amount of data, non-parametric approaches such as nearest neighbor classifiers have shown promising results, especially when they are underpinned by a learned distance or similarity measurement. Although metric learning has been well studied in the past decades, most existing algorithms are impractical to handle large-scale data sets. In this paper, we present an image similarity learning method that can scale well in both the number of images and the dimensionality of image descriptors. To this end, similarity comparison is restricted to each sample's local neighbors and a discriminative similarity measure is induced from large margin neighborhood embedding. We also exploit the ensemble of projections so that high-dimensional features can be processed in a set of lower-dimensional subspaces in parallel without much performance compromise. The similarity function is learned online using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm in which the triplet sampling strategy is customized for quick convergence of classification performance. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated on several data sets with scales varying from tens of thousands to one million images. Recognition accuracies competitive with the state-of-the-art performance are achieved with much higher efficiency and scalability.

- **Summary**: Human face as a physical human recognition can be used as a unique identity for computer to recognize human by transforming human face with face algorithm as simple text number which can be primary key for human. Human face as single identity for human will be done by making a huge and large world centre human face database, where the human face around the world will be recorded from time to time and from generation to generation. Architecture database will be divided become human face image database which will save human face images and human face output code which will save human face output code as a transformation human face image with face algorithm. As an improvement the slightly and simple human face output code database will make human face searching process become more fast. Transaction with human face as a transaction without card can make human no need their card for the transaction and office automation and banking system as an example for implementation architecture. As an addition suspect human face database can be extended for fighting crime and terrorism by doing surveillance and searching suspect human face around the world.

- **Summary**: The tracking algorithm performance depends on video content. This paper presents a new multi-object tracking approach which is able to cope with video content variations. First the object detection is improved using Kanade- Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracking. Second, for each mobile object, an appropriate tracker is selected among a KLT-based tracker and a discriminative appearance-based tracker. This selection is supported by an online tracking evaluation. The approach has been experimented on three public video datasets. The experimental results show a better performance of the proposed approach compared to recent state of the art trackers.

- **Summary**: Compression of documents, images, audios and videos have been traditionally practiced to increase the efficiency of data storage and transfer. However, in order to process or carry out any analytical computations, decompression has become an unavoidable pre-requisite. In this research work, we have attempted to compute the entropy, which is an important document analytic directly from the compressed documents. We use Conventional Entropy Quantifier (CEQ) and Spatial Entropy Quantifiers (SEQ) for entropy computations [1]. The entropies obtained are useful in applications like establishing equivalence, word spotting and document retrieval. Experiments have been performed with all the data sets of [1], at character, word and line levels taking compressed documents in run-length compressed domain. The algorithms developed are computational and space efficient, and results obtained match 100% with the results reported in [1].

- **Summary**: Conditional random fields (CRFs) are popular discriminative models for computer vision and have been successfully applied in the domain of image restoration, especially to image denoising. For image deblurring, however, discriminative approaches have been mostly lacking. We posit two reasons for this: First, the blur kernel is often only known at test time, requiring any discriminative approach to cope with considerable variability. Second, given this variability it is quite difficult to construct suitable features for discriminative prediction. To address these challenges we first show a connection between common half-quadratic inference for generative image priors and Gaussian CRFs. Based on this analysis, we then propose a cascade model for image restoration that consists of a Gaussian CRF at each stage. Each stage of our cascade is semi-parametric, i.e. it depends on the instance-specific parameters of the restoration problem, such as the blur kernel. We train our model by loss minimization with synthetically generated training data. Our experiments show that when applied to non-blind image deblurring, the proposed approach is efficient and yields state-of-the-art restoration quality on images corrupted with synthetic and real blur. Moreover, we demonstrate its suitability for image denoising, where we achieve competitive results for grayscale and color images.

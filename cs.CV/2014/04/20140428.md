- **Summary**: This paper proposes the Proximal Iteratively REweighted (PIRE) algorithm for solving a general problem, which involves a large body of nonconvex sparse and structured sparse related problems. Comparing with previous iterative solvers for nonconvex sparse problem, PIRE is much more general and efficient. The computational cost of PIRE in each iteration is usually as low as the state-of-the-art convex solvers. We further propose the PIRE algorithm with Parallel Splitting (PIRE-PS) and PIRE algorithm with Alternative Updating (PIRE-AU) to handle the multi-variable problems. In theory, we prove that our proposed methods converge and any limit solution is a stationary point. Extensive experiments on both synthesis and real data sets demonstrate that our methods achieve comparative learning performance, but are much more efficient, by comparing with previous nonconvex solvers.

- **Summary**: We propose an algorithm for recovering depth using less than two images. Instead of having both cameras send their entire image to the host computer, the left camera sends its image to the host while the right camera sends only a fraction $\epsilon$ of its image. The key aspect is that the cameras send the information without communicating at all. Hence, the required communication bandwidth is significantly reduced.   While standard image compression techniques can reduce the communication bandwidth, this requires additional computational resources on the part of the encoder (camera). We aim at designing a light weight encoder that only touches a fraction of the pixels. The burden of decoding is placed on the decoder (host).   We show that it is enough for the encoder to transmit a sparse set of pixels. Using only $1+\epsilon$ images, with $\epsilon$ as little as 2% of the image, the decoder can compute a depth map. The depth map's accuracy is comparable to traditional stereo matching algorithms that require both images as input. Using the depth map and the left image, the right image can be synthesized. No computations are required at the encoder, and the decoder's runtime is linear in the images' size.

- **Summary**: The ability to recognize the liquid surface and the liquid level in transparent containers is perhaps the most commonly used evaluation method when dealing with fluids. Such recognition is essential in determining the liquid volume, fill level, phase boundaries and phase separation in various fluid systems. The recognition of liquid surfaces is particularly important in solution chemistry, where it is essential to many laboratory techniques (e.g., extraction, distillation, titration). A general method for the recognition of interfaces between liquid and air or between phase-separating liquids could have a wide range of applications and contribute to the understanding of the visual properties of such interfaces. This work examines a computer vision method for the recognition of liquid surfaces and liquid levels in various transparent containers. The method can be applied to recognition of both liquid-air and liquid-liquid surfaces. No prior knowledge of the number of phases is required. The method receives the image of the liquid container and the boundaries of the container in the image and scans all possible curves that could correspond to the outlines of liquid surfaces in the image. The method then compares each curve to the image to rate its correspondence with the outline of the real liquid surface by examining various image properties in the area surrounding each point of the curve. The image properties that were found to give the best indication of the liquid surface are the relative intensity change, the edge density change and the gradient direction relative to the curve normal.

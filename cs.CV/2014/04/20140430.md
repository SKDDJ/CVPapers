- **Summary**: From many fewer acquired measurements than suggested by the Nyquist sampling theory, compressive sensing (CS) theory demonstrates that, a signal can be reconstructed with high probability when it exhibits sparsity in some domain. Most of the conventional CS recovery approaches, however, exploited a set of fixed bases (e.g. DCT, wavelet and gradient domain) for the entirety of a signal, which are irrespective of the non-stationarity of natural signals and cannot achieve high enough degree of sparsity, thus resulting in poor CS recovery performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework for image compressive sensing recovery using adaptively learned sparsifying basis via L0 minimization. The intrinsic sparsity of natural images is enforced substantially by sparsely representing overlapped image patches using the adaptively learned sparsifying basis in the form of L0 norm, greatly reducing blocking artifacts and confining the CS solution space. To make our proposed scheme tractable and robust, a split Bregman iteration based technique is developed to solve the non-convex L0 minimization problem efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of natural images for CS recovery have shown that our proposed algorithm achieves significant performance improvements over many current state-of-the-art schemes and exhibits good convergence property.

- **Summary**: The core component of most modern trackers is a discriminative classifier, tasked with distinguishing between the target and the surrounding environment. To cope with natural image changes, this classifier is typically trained with translated and scaled sample patches. Such sets of samples are riddled with redundancies -- any overlapping pixels are constrained to be the same. Based on this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands of translated patches. By showing that the resulting data matrix is circulant, we can diagonalize it with the Discrete Fourier Transform, reducing both storage and computation by several orders of magnitude. Interestingly, for linear regression our formulation is equivalent to a correlation filter, used by some of the fastest competitive trackers. For kernel regression, however, we derive a new Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF), that unlike other kernel algorithms has the exact same complexity as its linear counterpart. Building on it, we also propose a fast multi-channel extension of linear correlation filters, via a linear kernel, which we call Dual Correlation Filter (DCF). Both KCF and DCF outperform top-ranking trackers such as Struck or TLD on a 50 videos benchmark, despite running at hundreds of frames-per-second, and being implemented in a few lines of code (Algorithm 1). To encourage further developments, our tracking framework was made open-source.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) for robustly separating video frames into background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) components in real-time. The method is a novel application of a technique used for characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose Fourier components in time are known. DMD terms with Fourier frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given video frames, and the terms with Fourier frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. An approximate low-rank/sparse separation is achieved at the computational cost of just one singular value decomposition and one linear equation solve, thus producing results orders of magnitude faster than a leading separation method, namely robust principal component analysis (RPCA). The DMD method that is developed here is demonstrated to work robustly in real-time with personal laptop-class computing power and without any parameter tuning, which is a transformative improvement in performance that is ideal for video surveillance and recognition applications.



### Selecting a Small Set of Optimal Gestures from an Extensive Lexicon

- **Summary**: Finding the best set of gestures to use for a given computer recognition problem is an essential part of optimizing the recognition performance while being mindful to those who may articulate the gestures. An objective function, called the ellipsoidal distance ratio metric (EDRM), for determining the best gestures from a larger lexicon library is presented, along with a numerical method for incorporating subjective preferences. In particular, we demonstrate an efficient algorithm that chooses the best $n$ gestures from a lexicon of $m$ gestures where typically $n \ll m$ using a weighting of both subjective and objective measures.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an efficient edge detection method based on Gabor filter and rough clustering. The input image is smoothed by Gabor function, and the concept of rough clustering is used to focus on edge detection with soft computational approach. Hysteresis thresholding is used to get the actual output, i.e. edges of the input image. To show the effectiveness, the proposed technique is compared with some other edge detection methods.

- **Summary**: Commercial head-mounted eye trackers provide useful features to customers in industry and research but are expensive and rely on closed source hardware and software. This limits the application areas and use of mobile eye tracking to expert users and inhibits user-driven development, customisation, and extension. In this paper we present Pupil -- an accessible, affordable, and extensible open source platform for mobile eye tracking and gaze-based interaction. Pupil comprises 1) a light-weight headset with high-resolution cameras, 2) an open source software framework for mobile eye tracking, as well as 3) a graphical user interface (GUI) to playback and visualize video and gaze data. Pupil features high-resolution scene and eye cameras for monocular and binocular gaze estimation. The software and GUI are platform-independent and include state-of-the-art algorithms for real-time pupil detection and tracking, calibration, and accurate gaze estimation. Results of a performance evaluation show that Pupil can provide an average gaze estimation accuracy of 0.6 degree of visual angle (0.08 degree precision) with a latency of the processing pipeline of only 0.045 seconds.

- **Summary**: We consider grouping as a general characterization for problems such as clustering, community detection in networks, and multiple parametric model estimation. We are interested in merging solutions from different grouping algorithms, distilling all their good qualities into a consensus solution. In this paper, we propose a bi-clustering framework and perspective for reaching consensus in such grouping problems. In particular, this is the first time that the task of finding/fitting multiple parametric models to a dataset is formally posed as a consensus problem. We highlight the equivalence of these tasks and establish the connection with the computational Gestalt program, that seeks to provide a psychologically-inspired detection theory for visual events. We also present a simple but powerful bi-clustering algorithm, specially tuned to the nature of the problem we address, though general enough to handle many different instances inscribed within our characterization. The presentation is accompanied with diverse and extensive experimental results in clustering, community detection, and multiple parametric model estimation in image processing applications.

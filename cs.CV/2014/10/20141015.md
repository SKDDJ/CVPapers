- **Summary**: In object recognition, Fisher vector (FV) representation is one of the state-of-art image representations ways at the expense of dense, high dimensional features and increased computation time. A simplification of FV is attractive, so we propose Sparse Fisher vector (SFV). By incorporating locality strategy, we can accelerate the Fisher coding step in image categorization which is implemented from a collective of local descriptors. Combining with pooling step, we explore the relationship between coding step and pooling step to give a theoretical explanation about SFV. Experiments on benchmark datasets have shown that SFV leads to a speedup of several-fold of magnitude compares with FV, while maintaining the categorization performance. In addition, we demonstrate how SFV preserves the consistence in representation of similar local features.

- **Summary**: Structure information is ubiquitous in natural scene images and it plays an important role in scene representation. In this paper, third order structure statistics (TOSS) and fourth order structure statistics (FOSS) are exploited to encode higher order structure information. Afterwards, based on the radial and normal slice of TOSS and FOSS, we propose the high order structure feature: third order structure feature (TOSF) and fourth order structure feature (FOSF). It is well known that scene images are well characterized by particular arrangements of their local structures, we divide the scene image into the non-overlapping sub-regions and compute the proposed higher order structural features among them. Then a scene classification is performed by using SVM classifier with these higher order structure features. The experimental results show that higher order structure statistics can deliver image structure information well and its spatial envelope has strong discriminative ability.

- **Summary**: The increasing number of cameras and a handful of human operators to monitor the video inputs from hundreds of cameras leave the system ill equipped to fulfil the task of detecting anomalies. Thus, there is a dire need to automatically detect regions that require immediate attention for a more effective and proactive surveillance. We propose a framework that utilises the temporal variations in the flow field of a crowd scene to automatically detect salient regions, while eliminating the need to have prior knowledge of the scene or training. We deem the flow fields to be a dynamic system and adopt the stability theory of dynamical systems, to determine the motion dynamics within a given area. In the context of this work, salient regions refer to areas with high motion dynamics, where points in a particular region are unstable. Experimental results on public, crowd scenes have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting salient regions which correspond to unstable flow, occlusions, bottlenecks, entries and exits.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a real-time approach for single-colored ball detection and tracking. The approach consists of two main phases. In a first offline calibration phase, the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the radial distortion are estimated, and a classification of colors is learned from a sample image of colored balls. The second phase consists of four main steps: (1) color segmentation of the input image into several regions based on the offline classification, (2) robust estimation of the circle parameters (3) refinement of the circle parameters, and (4) ball tracking. The experimental results showed that the approach presents a good compromise between suitability for real-time navigation and robustness to occlusions, background congestion and colors interference in the scene.

- **Summary**: Gesturing is one of the natural modes of human communication. Signs produced by gestures can have a basic meaning coupled with additional information that is layered over the basic meaning of the sign. Sign language is an important example of communicative gestures that are highly structured and well accepted across the world as a communication medium for deaf and dumb. In this paper, an online recognition scheme is proposed to interpret the standard numeric sign language comprising of 10 basic hand symbols. A web camera is used to capture the real time hand movements as input to the system. The basic meaning of the hand gesture is extracted from the input data frame by analysing the shape of the hand, considering its orientation, movement and location to be fixed. The input hand shape is processed to identify the palm structure, fingertips and their relative positions and the presence of the extended thumb. A 2-dimensional skeletal model is generated from the acquired shape information to represent and subsequently interpret the basic meaning of the hand gesture.

- **Summary**: The work presents an extension of the fuzzy approach to 2-D shape recognition [1] through refinement of initial or coarse classification decisions under a two pass approach. In this approach, an unknown pattern is classified by refining possible classification decisions obtained through coarse classification of the same. To build a fuzzy model of a pattern class horizontal and vertical fuzzy partitions on the sample images of the class are optimized using genetic algorithm. To make coarse classification decisions about an unknown pattern, the fuzzy representation of the pattern is compared with models of all pattern classes through a specially designed similarity measure. Coarse classification decisions are refined in the second pass to obtain the final classification decision of the unknown pattern. To do so, optimized horizontal and vertical fuzzy partitions are again created on certain regions of the image frame, specific to each group of similar type of pattern classes. It is observed through experiments that the technique improves the overall recognition rate from 86.2%, in the first pass, to 90.4% after the second pass, with 500 training samples of handwritten digits.

- **Summary**: Online tracking of human activity against a complex background is a challenging task for many applications. In this paper, we have developed a robust technique for localizing skin colour regions from unconstrained image frames. A simple and fast segmentation algorithm is used to train a multiplayer perceptron (MLP) for detection of skin colours. Stepper motors are synchronized with the MLP to track the movement of the skin colour regions.

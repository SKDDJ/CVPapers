- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of learning word image representations: given the cropped image of a word, we are interested in finding a descriptive, robust, and compact fixed-length representation. Machine learning techniques can then be supplied with these representations to produce models useful for word retrieval or recognition tasks. Although many works have focused on the machine learning aspect once a global representation has been produced, little work has been devoted to the construction of those base image representations: most works use standard coding and aggregation techniques directly on top of standard computer vision features such as SIFT or HOG.   We propose to learn local mid-level features suitable for building word image representations. These features are learnt by leveraging character bounding box annotations on a small set of training images. However, contrary to other approaches that use character bounding box information, our approach does not rely on detecting the individual characters explicitly at testing time. Our local mid-level features can then be aggregated to produce a global word image signature. When pairing these features with the recent word attributes framework of Almaz\'an et al., we obtain results comparable with or better than the state-of-the-art on matching and recognition tasks using global descriptors of only 96 dimensions.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the SPARE C++ library, an open source software tool conceived to build pattern recognition and soft computing systems. The library follows the requirement of the generality: most of the implemented algorithms are able to process user-defined input data types transparently, such as labeled graphs and sequences of objects, as well as standard numeric vectors. Here we present a high-level picture of the SPARE library characteristics, focusing instead on the specific practical possibility of constructing pattern recognition systems for different input data types. In particular, as a proof of concept, we discuss two application instances involving clustering of real-valued multidimensional sequences and classification of labeled graphs.

- **Summary**: We propose a strategy for land use classification which exploits Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to automatically determine a suitable combination of a set of features without requiring any heuristic knowledge about the classification task. We present a novel procedure that allows MKL to achieve good performance in the case of small training sets. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Objective. The paper investigates the presence of autism using the functional brain connectivity measures derived from electro-encephalogram (EEG) of children during face perception tasks. Approach. Phase synchronized patterns from 128-channel EEG signals are obtained for typical children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The phase synchronized states or synchrostates temporally switch amongst themselves as an underlying process for the completion of a particular cognitive task. We used 12 subjects in each group (ASD and typical) for analyzing their EEG while processing fearful, happy and neutral faces. The minimal and maximally occurring synchrostates for each subject are chosen for extraction of brain connectivity features, which are used for classification between these two groups of subjects. Among different supervised learning techniques, we here explored the discriminant analysis and support vector machine both with polynomial kernels for the classification task. Main results. The leave one out cross-validation of the classification algorithm gives 94.7% accuracy as the best performance with corresponding sensitivity and specificity values as 85.7% and 100% respectively. Significance. The proposed method gives high classification accuracies and outperforms other contemporary research results. The effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of autistic and typical children suggests the possibility of using it on a larger population to validate it for clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Stochastic sampling based trackers have shown good performance for abrupt motion tracking so that they have gained popularity in recent years. However, conventional methods tend to use a two-stage sampling paradigm, in which the search space needs to be uniformly explored with an inefficient preliminary sampling phase. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based method in the Bayesian filtering framework to address the problem. Within the framework, nearest neighbor field estimation is utilized to compute the importance proposal probabilities, which guide the Markov chain search towards promising regions and thus enhance the sampling efficiency; given the motion priors, a smoothing stochastic sampling Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to approximate the posterior distribution through a smoothing weight-updating scheme. Moreover, to track the abrupt and the smooth motions simultaneously, we develop an abrupt-motion detection scheme which can discover the presence of abrupt motions during online tracking. Extensive experiments on challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our algorithm in handling the abrupt motions.

- **Summary**: A robust estimator, namely M-smoother, for piecewise-constant smoothing is revisited in this paper. Starting from its generalized formulation, we propose a numerical scheme/framework for solving it via a series of weighted-average filtering (e.g., box filtering, Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering, and guided filtering). Because of the equivalence between M-smoother and local-histogram-based filters (such as median filter and mode filter), the proposed framework enables fast approximation of histogram filters via a number of box filtering or Gaussian filtering. In addition, high-quality piecewise-constant smoothing can be achieved via a number of bilateral filtering or guided filtering integrated in the proposed framework. Experiments on depth map denoising show the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Summary**: A new scheme for digital image correlation, i.e., short time series DIC (STS-DIC) is proposed. Instead of processing the original deformed speckle images individually, STS-DIC combines several adjacent deformed speckle images from a short time series and then processes the averaged image, for which deformation continuity over time is introduced. The deformation of several adjacent images is assumed to be linear in time and a new spatial-temporal displacement representation method with eight unknowns is presented based on the subset-based representation method. Then, the model of STS-DIC is created and a solving scheme is developed based on the Newton-Raphson iteration. The proposed method is verified for numerical and experimental cases. The results show that the proposed STS-DIC greatly improves the accuracy of traditional DIC, both under simple and complicated deformation conditions, while retaining acceptable actual computational cost.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a new similarity index for images considering the entropy function and group theory. This index considers an algebraic group of images, it is defined by an inner law that provides a novel approach for the subtraction of images. Through an equivalence relationship in the field of images, we prove the existence of the quotient group, on which the new similarity index is defined. We also present the main properties of the new index, and the immediate application thereof as a stopping criterion of the "Mean Shift Iterative Algorithm".

- **Summary**: Object recognition in the presence of background clutter and distractors is a central problem both in neuroscience and in machine learning. However, the performance level of the models that are inspired by cortical mechanisms, including deep networks such as convolutional neural networks and deep belief networks, is shown to significantly decrease in the presence of noise and background objects [19, 24]. Here we develop a computational framework that is hierarchical, relies heavily on key properties of the visual cortex including mid-level feature selectivity in visual area V4 and Inferotemporal cortex (IT) [4, 9, 12, 18], high degrees of selectivity and invariance in IT [13, 17, 18] and the prior knowledge that is built into cortical circuits (such as the emergence of edge detector neurons in primary visual cortex before the onset of the visual experience) [1, 21], and addresses the problem of object recognition in the presence of background noise and distractors. Our approach is specifically designed to address large deformations, allows flexible communication between different layers of representation and learns highly selective filters from a small number of training examples.

- **Summary**: We propose a symmetric low-rank representation (SLRR) method for subspace clustering, which assumes that a data set is approximately drawn from the union of multiple subspaces. The proposed technique can reveal the membership of multiple subspaces through the self-expressiveness property of the data. In particular, the SLRR method considers a collaborative representation combined with low-rank matrix recovery techniques as a low-rank representation to learn a symmetric low-rank representation, which preserves the subspace structures of high-dimensional data. In contrast to performing iterative singular value decomposition in some existing low-rank representation based algorithms, the symmetric low-rank representation in the SLRR method can be calculated as a closed form solution by solving the symmetric low-rank optimization problem. By making use of the angular information of the principal directions of the symmetric low-rank representation, an affinity graph matrix is constructed for spectral clustering. Extensive experimental results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.

- **Summary**: Computer vision plays a major role in the robotics industry, where vision data is frequently used for navigation and high-level decision making. Although there is significant research in algorithms and functional requirements, there is a comparative lack of emphasis on how best to map these abstract concepts onto an appropriate software architecture.   In this study, we distinguish between the functional and non-functional requirements of a computer vision system. Using a RoboCup humanoid robot system as a case study, we propose and develop a software architecture that fulfills the latter criteria.   The modifiability of the proposed architecture is demonstrated by detailing a number of feature detection algorithms and emphasizing which aspects of the underlying framework were modified to support their integration. To demonstrate portability, we port our vision system (designed for an application-specific DARwIn-OP humanoid robot) to a general-purpose, Raspberry Pi computer. We evaluate performance on both platforms and compare them to a vision system optimised for functional requirements only.   The architecture and implementation presented in this study provide a highly generalisable framework for computer vision system design that is of particular benefit in research and development, competition and other environments in which rapid system evolution is necessary.

- **Summary**: Visual data driven dictionaries have been successfully employed for various object recognition and classification tasks. However, the task becomes more challenging if the training and test data are from contrasting domains. In this paper, we propose a novel and generalized approach towards learning an adaptive and common dictionary for multiple domains. Precisely, we project the data from different domains onto a low dimensional space while preserving the intrinsic structure of data from each domain. We also minimize the domain-shift among the data from each pair of domains. Simultaneously, we learn a common adaptive dictionary. Our algorithm can also be modified to learn class-specific dictionaries which can be used for classification. We additionally propose a discriminative manifold regularization which imposes the intrinsic structure of class specific features onto the sparse coefficients. Experiments on image classification show that our approach fares better compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

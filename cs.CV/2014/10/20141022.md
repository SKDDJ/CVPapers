- **Summary**: Vehicle detection and tracking applications play an important role for civilian and military applications such as in highway traffic surveillance control, management and urban traffic planning. Vehicle detection process on road are used for vehicle tracking, counts, average speed of each individual vehicle, traffic analysis and vehicle categorizing objectives and may be implemented under different environments changes. In this review, we present a concise overview of image processing methods and analysis tools which used in building these previous mentioned applications that involved developing traffic surveillance systems. More precisely and in contrast with other reviews, we classified the processing methods under three categories for more clarification to explain the traffic systems.

- **Summary**: Salient object detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. In this paper, we formulate saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, utilizes the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score. Saliency scores across multiple levels are finally fused to produce the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we propose a discriminate regional feature integration approach for salient object detection. Compared with existing heuristic models, our proposed method is able to automatically integrate high-dimensional regional saliency features and choose discriminative ones. The other is that by investigating standard generic region properties as well as two widely studied concepts for salient object detection, i.e., regional contrast and backgroundness, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmark datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our method runs as fast as most existing algorithms.

- **Summary**: In this work, we address the problem of outlier detection for robust motion estimation by using modern sparse-low-rank decompositions, i.e., Robust PCA-like methods, to impose global rank constraints. Robust decompositions have shown to be good at splitting a corrupted matrix into an uncorrupted low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, containing outliers. However, this process only works when matrices have relatively low rank with respect to their ambient space, a property not met in motion estimation problems. As a solution, we propose to exploit the partial information present in the decomposition to decide which matches are outliers. We provide evidences showing that even when it is not possible to recover an uncorrupted low-rank matrix, the resulting information can be exploited for outlier detection. To this end we propose the Robust Decomposition with Constrained Rank (RD-CR), a proximal gradient based method that enforces the rank constraints inherent to motion estimation. We also present a general framework to perform robust estimation for stereo Visual Odometry, based on our RD-CR and a simple but effective compressed optimization method that achieves high performance. Our evaluation on synthetic data and on the KITTI dataset demonstrates the applicability of our approach in complex scenarios and it yields state-of-the-art performance.

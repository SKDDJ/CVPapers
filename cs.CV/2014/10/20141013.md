- **Summary**: Due to the subjective nature of social tagging, measuring the relevance of social tags with respect to the visual content is crucial for retrieving the increasing amounts of social-networked images. Witnessing the limit of a single measurement of tag relevance, we introduce in this paper tag relevance fusion as an extension to methods for tag relevance estimation. We present a systematic study, covering tag relevance fusion in early and late stages, and in supervised and unsupervised settings. Experiments on a large present-day benchmark set show that tag relevance fusion leads to better image retrieval. Moreover, unsupervised tag relevance fusion is found to be practically as effective as supervised tag relevance fusion, but without the need of any training efforts. This finding suggests the potential of tag relevance fusion for real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution remains an important research topic to overcome the limitations of physical acquisition systems, and to support the development of high resolution displays. Previous example-based super-resolution approaches mainly focus on analyzing the co-occurrence properties of low resolution and high-resolution patches. Recently, we proposed a novel single image super-resolution approach based on linear manifold approximation of the high-resolution image-patch space [1]. The image super-resolution problem is then formulated as an optimization problem of searching for the best matched high resolution patch in the manifold for a given low-resolution patch. We developed a novel technique based on the l1 norm sparse graph to learn a set of low dimensional affine spaces or tangent subspaces of the high-resolution patch manifold. The optimization problem is then solved based on the learned set of tangent subspaces. In this paper, we build on our recent work as follows. First, we consider and analyze each tangent subspace as one point in a Grassmann manifold, which helps to compute geodesic pairwise distances among these tangent subspaces. Second, we develop a min-max algorithm to select an optimal subset of tangent subspaces. This optimal subset reduces the computational cost while still preserving the quality of the reconstructed high-resolution image. Third, and to further achieve lower computational complexity, we perform hierarchical clustering on the optimal subset based on Grassmann manifold distances. Finally, we analytically prove the validity of the proposed Grassmann-distance based clustering. A comparison of the obtained results with other state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability of the new proposed framework.

- **Summary**: In image registration, a proper transformation should be topology preserving. Especially for landmark-based image registration, if the displacement of one landmark is larger enough than those of neighbourhood landmarks, topology violation will be occurred. This paper aim to analyse the topology preservation of some Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) which are used to model deformations in image registration. Mat\'{e}rn functions are quite common in the statistic literature (see, e.g. \cite{Matern86,Stein99}). In this paper, we use them to solve the landmark-based image registration problem. We present the topology preservation properties of RBFs in one landmark and four landmarks model respectively. Numerical results of three kinds of Mat\'{e}rn transformations are compared with results of Gaussian, Wendland's, and Wu's functions.

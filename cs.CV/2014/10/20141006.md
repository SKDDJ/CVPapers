- **Summary**: Real-time detection of moving objects involves memorisation of features in the template image and their comparison with those in the test image. At high sampling rates, such techniques face the problems of high algorithmic complexity and component delays. We present a new resistive switching based threshold logic cell which encodes the pixels of a template image. The cell comprises a voltage divider circuit that programs the resistances of the memristors arranged in a single node threshold logic network and the output is encoded as a binary value using a CMOS inverter gate. When a test image is applied to the template-programmed cell, a mismatch in the respective pixels is seen as a change in the output voltage of the cell. The proposed cell when compared with CMOS equivalent implementation shows improved performance in area, leakage power, power dissipation and delay.

- **Summary**: In this paper, three Computational Topology methods (namely effective homology, persistent homology and discrete vector fields) are mixed together to produce algorithms for homological digital image processing. The algorithms have been implemented as extensions of the Kenzo system and have shown a good performance when applied on some actual images extracted from a public dataset.

- **Summary**: Aerial image categorization plays an indispensable role in remote sensing and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new aerial image categorization framework, focusing on organizing the local patches of each aerial image into multiple discriminative subgraphs. The subgraphs reflect both the geometric property and the color distribution of an aerial image. First, each aerial image is decomposed into a collection of regions in terms of their color intensities. Thereby region connected graph (RCG), which models the connection between the spatial neighboring regions, is constructed to encode the spatial context of an aerial image. Second, a subgraph mining technique is adopted to discover the frequent structures in the RCGs constructed from the training aerial images. Thereafter, a set of refined structures are selected among the frequent ones toward being highly discriminative and low redundant. Lastly, given a new aerial image, its sub-RCGs corresponding to the refined structures are extracted. They are further quantized into a discriminative vector for SVM classification. Thorough experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the visualized mined subgraphs show that the discriminative topologies of each aerial image are discovered.

- **Summary**: In dealing with the problem of recognition of handwritten character patterns of varying shapes and sizes, selection of a proper feature set is important to achieve high recognition performance. The current research aims to evaluate the performance of the convex hull based feature set, i.e. 125 features in all computed over different bays attributes of the convex hull of a pattern, for effective recognition of isolated handwritten Bangla basic characters and digits. On experimentation with a database of 10000 samples, the maximum recognition rate of 76.86% is observed for handwritten Bangla characters. For Bangla numerals the maximum success rate of 99.45%. is achieved on a database of 12000 sample. The current work validates the usefulness of a new kind of feature set for recognition of handwritten Bangla basic characters and numerals.

- **Summary**: Recursive, causal and non-causal, multidimensional digital filters, with infinite impulse responses and maximally flat magnitude and delay responses in the low-frequency region, are designed to negate correlated clutter and interference in the background and to accumulate power due to dim targets in the foreground of a surveillance sensor. Expressions relating mean impulse-response duration, frequency selectivity and group delay, to low-order linear-difference-equation coefficients are derived using discrete Laguerre polynomials and discounted least-squares regression, then verified through simulation.

- **Summary**: The implicit objective of the biennial "international - Traveling Workshop on Interactions between Sparse models and Technology" (iTWIST) is to foster collaboration between international scientific teams by disseminating ideas through both specific oral/poster presentations and free discussions. For its second edition, the iTWIST workshop took place in the medieval and picturesque town of Namur in Belgium, from Wednesday August 27th till Friday August 29th, 2014. The workshop was conveniently located in "The Arsenal" building within walking distance of both hotels and town center. iTWIST'14 has gathered about 70 international participants and has featured 9 invited talks, 10 oral presentations, and 14 posters on the following themes, all related to the theory, application and generalization of the "sparsity paradigm": Sparsity-driven data sensing and processing; Union of low dimensional subspaces; Beyond linear and convex inverse problem; Matrix/manifold/graph sensing/processing; Blind inverse problems and dictionary learning; Sparsity and computational neuroscience; Information theory, geometry and randomness; Complexity/accuracy tradeoffs in numerical methods; Sparsity? What's next?; Sparse machine learning and inference.

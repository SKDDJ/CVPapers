- **Summary**: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for localizing and analyzing brain activity. This study focuses on one very important aspect of the functional properties of human brain, specifically the estimation of the level of parallelism when performing complex cognitive tasks. Using fMRI as the main modality, the human brain activity is investigated through a purely data-driven signal processing and dimensionality analysis approach. Specifically, the fMRI signal is treated as a multi-dimensional data space and its intrinsic `complexity' is studied via dataset fractal analysis and blind-source separation (BSS) methods. One simulated and two real fMRI datasets are used in combination with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and fractal analysis for estimating the intrinsic (true) dimensionality, in order to provide data-driven experimental evidence on the number of independent brain processes that run in parallel when visual or visuo-motor tasks are performed. Although this number is can not be defined as a strict threshold but rather as a continuous range, when a specific activation level is defined, a corresponding number of parallel processes or the casual equivalent of `cpu cores' can be detected in normal human brain activity.

- **Summary**: We propose a bilateral filter with a locally controlled domain kernel for directional edge-preserving smoothing. Traditional bilateral filters use a range kernel, which is responsible for edge preservation, and a fixed domain kernel that performs smoothing. Our intuition is that orientation and anisotropy of image structures should be incorporated into the domain kernel while smoothing. For this purpose, we employ an oriented Gaussian domain kernel locally controlled by a structure tensor. The oriented domain kernel combined with a range kernel forms the directional bilateral filter. The two kernels assist each other in effectively suppressing the influence of the outliers while smoothing. To find the optimal parameters of the directional bilateral filter, we propose the use of Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). We test the capabilities of the kernels separately as well as together, first on synthetic images, and then on real endoscopic images. The directional bilateral filter has better denoising performance than the Gaussian bilateral filter at various noise levels in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).

- **Summary**: Continuous follow-up of heart condition through long-term electrocardiogram monitoring is an invaluable tool for diagnosing some cardiac arrhythmias. In such context, providing tools for fast locating alterations of normal conduction patterns is mandatory and still remains an open issue. This work presents a real-time method for adaptive clustering QRS complexes from multilead ECG signals that provides the set of QRS morphologies that appear during an ECG recording. The method processes the QRS complexes sequentially, grouping them into a dynamic set of clusters based on the information content of the temporal context. The clusters are represented by templates which evolve over time and adapt to the QRS morphology changes. Rules to create, merge and remove clusters are defined along with techniques for noise detection in order to avoid their proliferation. To cope with beat misalignment, Derivative Dynamic Time Warping is used. The proposed method has been validated against the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the AHA ECG Database showing a global purity of 98.56% and 99.56%, respectively. Results show that our proposal not only provides better results than previous offline solutions but also fulfills real-time requirements.

- **Summary**: Iris Recognition Systems are ocular- based biometric devices used primarily for security reasons. The complexity and the randomness of the Iris, amongst various other factors, ensure that this biometric system is inarguably an exact and reliable method of identification. The algorithm is responsible for automatic localization and segmentation of boundaries using circular Hough Transform, noise reductions, image enhancement and feature extraction across numerous distinct images present in the database. This paper delves into the various kinds of techniques required to approximate the pupillary and limbic boundaries of the enrolled iris image, captured using a suitable image acquisition device and perform feature extraction on the normalized iris image with the help of Haar Wavelets to encode the input data into a binary string format. These techniques were validated using images from the CASIA database, and various other procedures were also tried and tested.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an approach to the unsupervised segmentation of images using Markov Random Field. The proposed approach is based on the idea of Bit Plane Slicing. We use the planes as initial labellings for an ensemble of segmentations. With pixelwise voting, a robust segmentation approach can be achieved, which we demonstrate on microscope cell images. We tested our approach on a publicly available database, where it proven to be competitive with other methods and manual segmentation.

- **Summary**: Information distance can be defined not only between two strings but also in a finite multiset of strings of cardinality greater than two. We give an elementary proof for expressing the information distance in terms of plain Kolmogorov complexity. It is exact since for each cardinality of the multiset the lower bound for some multiset equals the upper bound for all multisets up to a constant additive term.

- **Summary**: We consider detecting objects in an image by iteratively selecting from a set of arbitrarily shaped candidate regions. Our generic approach, which we term visual chunking, reasons about the locations of multiple object instances in an image while expressively describing object boundaries. We design an optimization criterion for measuring the performance of a list of such detections as a natural extension to a common per-instance metric. We present an efficient algorithm with provable performance for building a high-quality list of detections from any candidate set of region-based proposals. We also develop a simple class-specific algorithm to generate a candidate region instance in near-linear time in the number of low-level superpixels that outperforms other region generating methods. In order to make predictions on novel images at testing time without access to ground truth, we develop learning approaches to emulate these algorithms' behaviors. We demonstrate that our new approach outperforms sophisticated baselines on benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: A trainable filter-based higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRFs) model - the so called Fields of Experts (FoE), has proved a highly effective image prior model for many classic image restoration problems. Generally, two options are available to incorporate the learned FoE prior in the inference procedure: (1) sampling-based minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate, and (2) energy minimization-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. This letter is devoted to the FoE prior based single image super resolution (SR) problem, and we suggest to make use of the MAP estimate for inference based on two facts: (I) It is well-known that the MAP inference has a remarkable advantage of high computational efficiency, while the sampling-based MMSE estimate is very time consuming. (II) Practical SR experiment results demonstrate that the MAP estimate works equally well compared to the MMSE estimate with exactly the same FoE prior model. Moreover, it can lead to even further improvements by incorporating our discriminatively trained FoE prior model. In summary, we hold that for higher-order natural image prior based SR problem, it is better to employ the MAP estimate for inference.

- **Summary**: Generative models provide a powerful framework for probabilistic reasoning. However, in many domains their use has been hampered by the practical difficulties of inference. This is particularly the case in computer vision, where models of the imaging process tend to be large, loopy and layered. For this reason bottom-up conditional models have traditionally dominated in such domains. We find that widely-used, general-purpose message passing inference algorithms such as Expectation Propagation (EP) and Variational Message Passing (VMP) fail on the simplest of vision models. With these models in mind, we introduce a modification to message passing that learns to exploit their layered structure by passing 'consensus' messages that guide inference towards good solutions. Experiments on a variety of problems show that the proposed technique leads to significantly more accurate inference results, not only when compared to standard EP and VMP, but also when compared to competitive bottom-up conditional models.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel method for the segmentation of breast masses from mammograms exploring structured and deep learning. Specifically, using structured support vector machine (SSVM), we formulate a model that combines different types of potential functions, including one that classifies image regions using deep learning. Our main goal with this work is to show the accuracy and efficiency improvements that these relatively new techniques can provide for the segmentation of breast masses from mammograms. We also propose an easily reproducible quantitative analysis to as- sess the performance of breast mass segmentation methodologies based on widely accepted accuracy and running time measurements on public datasets, which will facilitate further comparisons for this segmentation problem. In particular, we use two publicly available datasets (DDSM-BCRP and INbreast) and propose the computa- tion of the running time taken for the methodology to produce a mass segmentation given an input image and the use of the Dice index to quantitatively measure the segmentation accuracy. For both databases, we show that our proposed methodology produces competitive results in terms of accuracy and running time.

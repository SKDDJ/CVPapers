- **Summary**: This paper introduces a graph Laplacian regularization in the hyperspectral unmixing formulation. The proposed regularization relies upon the construction of a graph representation of the hyperspectral image. Each node in the graph represents a pixel's spectrum, and edges connect spectrally and spatially similar pixels. The proposed graph framework promotes smoothness in the estimated abundance maps and collaborative estimation between homogeneous areas of the image. The resulting convex optimization problem is solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). A special attention is given to the computational complexity of the algorithm, and Graph-cut methods are proposed in order to reduce the computational burden. Finally, simulations conducted on synthetic data illustrate the effectiveness of the graph Laplacian regularization with respect to other classical regularizations for hyperspectral unmixing.

- **Summary**: Ambiguity or uncertainty is a pervasive element of many real world decision making processes. Variation in decisions is a norm in this situation when the same problem is posed to different subjects. Psychological and metaphysical research had proven that decision making by human is subjective. It is influenced by many factors such as experience, age, background, etc. Scene understanding is one of the computer vision problems that fall into this category. Conventional methods relax this problem by assuming scene images are mutually exclusive; and therefore, focus on developing different approaches to perform the binary classification tasks. In this paper, we show that scene images are non-mutually exclusive, and propose the Fuzzy Qualitative Rank Classifier (FQRC) to tackle the aforementioned problems. The proposed FQRC provides a ranking interpretation instead of binary decision. Evaluations in term of qualitative and quantitative using large numbers and challenging public scene datasets have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method in modeling the non-mutually exclusive scene images.

- **Summary**: Conventional tracking solutions are not feasible in handling abrupt motion as they are based on smooth motion assumption or an accurate motion model. Abrupt motion is not subject to motion continuity and smoothness. To assuage this, we deem tracking as an optimisation problem and propose a novel abrupt motion tracker that based on swarm intelligence - the SwaTrack. Unlike existing swarm-based filtering methods, we first of all introduce an optimised swarm-based sampling strategy to tradeoff between the exploration and exploitation of the search space in search for the optimal proposal distribution. Secondly, we propose Dynamic Acceleration Parameters (DAP) allow on the fly tuning of the best mean and variance of the distribution for sampling. Such innovating idea of combining these strategies in an ingenious way in the PSO framework to handle the abrupt motion, which so far no existing works are found. Experimental results in both quantitative and qualitative had shown the effectiveness of the proposed method in tracking abrupt motions.

- **Summary**: Object recognition systems usually require fully complete manually labeled training data to train the classifier. In this paper, we study the problem of object recognition where the training samples are missing during the classifier learning stage, a task also known as zero-shot learning. We propose a novel zero-shot learning strategy that utilizes the topic model and hierarchical class concept. Our proposed method advanced where cumbersome human annotation stage (i.e. attribute-based classification) is eliminated. We achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art algorithms in four public datasets: PubFig (67.09%), Cifar-100 (54.85%), Caltech-256 (52.14%), and Animals with Attributes (49.65%) when unseen classes exist in the classification task.

- **Summary**: A reliable human skin detection method that is adaptable to different human skin colours and illu- mination conditions is essential for better human skin segmentation. Even though different human skin colour detection solutions have been successfully applied, they are prone to false skin detection and are not able to cope with the variety of human skin colours across different ethnic. Moreover, existing methods require high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel human skin de- tection approach that combines a smoothed 2D histogram and Gaussian model, for automatic human skin detection in colour image(s). In our approach an eye detector is used to refine the skin model for a specific person. The proposed approach reduces computational costs as no training is required; and it improves the accuracy of skin detection despite wide variation in ethnicity and illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to employ fusion strategy for this purpose. Qualitative and quantitative results on three standard public datasets and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods have shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Image understanding is an important research domain in the computer vision due to its wide real-world applications. For an image understanding framework that uses the Bag-of-Words model representation, the visual codebook is an essential part. Random forest (RF) as a tree-structure discriminative codebook has been a popular choice. However, the performance of the RF can be degraded if the local patch labels are poorly assigned. In this paper, we tackle this problem by a novel way to update the RF codebook learning for a more discriminative codebook with the introduction of the soft class labels, estimated from the pLSA model based on a feedback scheme. The feedback scheme is performed on both the image and patch levels respectively, which is in contrast to the state- of-the-art RF codebook learning that focused on either image or patch level only. Experiments on 15-Scene and C-Pascal datasets had shown the effectiveness of the proposed method in image understanding task.

- **Summary**: It is common for CCTV operators to overlook inter- esting events taking place within the crowd due to large number of people in the crowded scene (i.e. marathon, rally). Thus, there is a dire need to automate the detection of salient crowd regions acquiring immediate attention for a more effective and proactive surveillance. This paper proposes a novel framework to identify and localize salient regions in a crowd scene, by transforming low-level features extracted from crowd motion field into a global similarity structure. The global similarity structure representation allows the discovery of the intrinsic manifold of the motion dynamics, which could not be captured by the low-level representation. Ranking is then performed on the global similarity structure to identify a set of extrema. The proposed approach is unsupervised so learning stage is eliminated. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of exploiting such extrema in identifying salient regions in various crowd scenarios that exhibit crowding, local irregular motion, and unique motion areas such as sources and sinks.

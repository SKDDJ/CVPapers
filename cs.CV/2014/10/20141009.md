- **Summary**: The paper presents a novel technique called "Structural Crossing-Over" to synthesize qualified data for training machine learning-based handwriting recognition. The proposed technique can provide a greater variety of patterns of training data than the existing approaches such as elastic distortion and tangent-based affine transformation. A couple of training characters are chosen, then they are analyzed by their similar and different structures, and finally are crossed over to generate the new characters. The experiments are set to compare the performances of tangent-based affine transformation and the proposed approach in terms of the variety of generated characters and percent of recognition errors. The standard MNIST corpus including 60,000 training characters and 10,000 test characters is employed in the experiments. The proposed technique uses 1,000 characters to synthesize 60,000 characters, and then uses these data to train and test the benchmark handwriting recognition system that exploits Histogram of Gradient (HOG) as features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as recognizer. The experimental result yields 8.06% of errors. It significantly outperforms the tangent-based affine transformation and the original MNIST training data, which are 11.74% and 16.55%, respectively.

- **Summary**: The complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence is considered to be the magic biometric technique for personal identification. In this paper, we present a new method for cDNA recognition based on the artificial neural network (ANN). Microarray imaging is used for the concurrent identification of thousands of genes. We have segmented the location of the spots in a cDNA microarray. Thus, a precise localization and segmenting of a spot are essential to obtain a more accurate intensity measurement, leading to a more precise expression measurement of a gene. The segmented cDNA microarray image is resized and it is used as an input for the proposed artificial neural network. For matching and recognition, we have trained the artificial neural network. Recognition results are given for the galleries of cDNA sequences . The numerical results show that, the proposed matching technique is an effective in the cDNA sequences process. We also compare our results with previous results and find out that, the proposed technique is an effective matching performance.

- **Summary**: We propose a generative model for robust tensor factorization in the presence of both missing data and outliers. The objective is to explicitly infer the underlying low-CP-rank tensor capturing the global information and a sparse tensor capturing the local information (also considered as outliers), thus providing the robust predictive distribution over missing entries. The low-CP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple latent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical prior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student-$t$ distribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element independently. For model learning, we develop an efficient closed-form variational inference under a fully Bayesian treatment, which can effectively prevent the overfitting problem and scales linearly with data size. In contrast to existing related works, our method can perform model selection automatically and implicitly without need of tuning parameters. More specifically, it can discover the groundtruth of CP rank and automatically adapt the sparsity inducing priors to various types of outliers. In addition, the tradeoff between the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be optimized in the sense of maximum model evidence. The extensive experiments and comparisons with many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiorities of our method from several perspectives.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a genetic stereo matching algorithm with fuzzy evaluation function. The proposed algorithm presents a new encoding scheme in which a chromosome is represented by a disparity matrix. Evolution is controlled by a fuzzy fitness function able to deal with noise and uncertain camera measurements, and uses classical evolutionary operators. The result of the algorithm is accurate dense disparity maps obtained in a reasonable computational time suitable for real-time applications as shown in experimental results.

- **Summary**: Object triangulation, 3-D object tracking, feature correspondence, and camera calibration are key problems for estimation from camera networks. This paper addresses these problems within a unified Bayesian framework for joint multi-object tracking and sensor registration. Given that using standard filtering approaches for state estimation from cameras is problematic, an alternative parametrisation is exploited, called disparity space. The disparity space-based approach for triangulation and object tracking is shown to be more effective than non-linear versions of the Kalman filter and particle filtering for non-rectified cameras. The approach for feature correspondence is based on the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, and hence inherits the ability to update without explicit measurement association, to initiate new targets, and to discriminate between target and clutter. The PHD filtering approach then forms the basis of a camera calibration method from static or moving objects. Results are shown on simulated data.

- **Summary**: Recently, mid-level features have shown promising performance in computer vision. Mid-level features learned by incorporating class-level information are potentially more discriminative than traditional low-level local features. In this paper, an effective method is proposed to extract mid-level features from Kinect skeletons for 3D human action recognition. Firstly, the orientations of limbs connected by two skeleton joints are computed and each orientation is encoded into one of the 27 states indicating the spatial relationship of the joints. Secondly, limbs are combined into parts and the limb's states are mapped into part states. Finally, frequent pattern mining is employed to mine the most frequent and relevant (discriminative, representative and non-redundant) states of parts in continuous several frames. These parts are referred to as Frequent Local Parts or FLPs. The FLPs allow us to build powerful bag-of-FLP-based action representation. This new representation yields state-of-the-art results on MSR DailyActivity3D and MSR ActionPairs3D.

- **Summary**: This paper presents the development of a new algorithm for Gaussian based color image enhancement system. The algorithm has been designed into architecture suitable for FPGA/ASIC implementation. The color image enhancement is achieved by first convolving an original image with a Gaussian kernel since Gaussian distribution is a point spread function which smoothen the image. Further, logarithm-domain processing and gain/offset corrections are employed in order to enhance and translate pixels into the display range of 0 to 255. The proposed algorithm not only provides better dynamic range compression and color rendition effect but also achieves color constancy in an image. The design exploits high degrees of pipelining and parallel processing to achieve real time performance. The design has been realized by RTL compliant Verilog coding and fits into a single FPGA with a gate count utilization of 321,804. The proposed method is implemented using Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP40-7FF1148 FPGA device and is capable of processing high resolution color motion pictures of sizes of up to 1600x1200 pixels at the real time video rate of 116 frames per second. This shows that the proposed design would work for not only still images but also for high resolution video sequences.

- **Summary**: A new approach for tuning the parameters of MultiScale Retinex (MSR) based color image enhancement algorithm using a popular optimization method, namely, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. The image enhancement using MSR scheme heavily depends on parameters such as Gaussian surround space constant, number of scales, gain and offset etc. Selection of these parameters, empirically and its application to MSR scheme to produce inevitable results are the major blemishes. The method presented here results in huge savings of computation time as well as improvement in the visual quality of an image, since the PSO exploited maximizes the MSR parameters. The objective of PSO is to validate the visual quality of the enhanced image iteratively using an effective objective criterion based on entropy and edge information of an image. The PSO method of parameter optimization of MSR scheme achieves a very good quality of reconstructed images, far better than that possible with the other existing methods. Finally, the quality of the enhanced color images obtained by the proposed method are evaluated using novel metric, namely, Wavelet Energy (WE). The experimental results presented show that color images enhanced using the proposed scheme are clearer, more vivid and efficient.

- **Summary**: We introduce a method based on the deflectometry principle for the reconstruction of specular objects exhibiting significant size and geometric complexity. A key feature of our approach is the deployment of an Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) as pattern generator. To unfold the full power of this extraordinary experimental setup, an optical encoding scheme is developed which accounts for the distinctive topology of the CAVE. Furthermore, we devise an algorithm for detecting the object of interest in raw deflectometric images. The segmented foreground is used for single-view reconstruction, the background for estimation of the camera pose, necessary for calibrating the sensor system. Experiments suggest a significant gain of coverage in single measurements compared to previous methods. To facilitate research on specular surface reconstruction, we will make our data set publicly available.

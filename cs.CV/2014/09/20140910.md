- **Summary**: Template matching is a basic method in image analysis to extract useful information from images. In this paper, we suggest a new method for pattern matching. Our method transform the template image from two dimensional image into one dimensional vector. Also all sub-windows (same size of template) in the reference image will transform into one dimensional vectors. The three similarity measures SAD, SSD, and Euclidean are used to compute the likeness between template and all sub-windows in the reference image to find the best match. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method over the conventional methods on various template of different sizes.

- **Summary**: Noise is a major issue while transferring images through all kinds of electronic communication. One of the most common noise in electronic communication is an impulse noise which is caused by unstable voltage. In this paper, the comparison of known image denoising techniques is discussed and a new technique using the decision based approach has been used for the removal of impulse noise. All these methods can primarily preserve image details while suppressing impulsive noise. The principle of these techniques is at first introduced and then analysed with various simulation results using MATLAB. Most of the previously known techniques are applicable for the denoising of images corrupted with less noise density. Here a new decision based technique has been presented which shows better performances than those already being used. The comparisons are made based on visual appreciation and further quantitatively by Mean Square error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of different filtered images..

- **Summary**: Majority of the existing robot navigation systems, which facilitate the use of laser range finders, sonar sensors or artificial landmarks, has the ability to locate itself in an unknown environment and then build a map of the corresponding environment. Stereo vision, while still being a rapidly developing technique in the field of autonomous mobile robots, are currently less preferable due to its high implementation cost. This paper aims at describing an experimental approach for the building of a stereo vision system that helps the robots to avoid obstacles and navigate through indoor environments and at the same time remaining very much cost effective. This paper discusses the fusion techniques of stereo vision and ultrasound sensors which helps in the successful navigation through different types of complex environments. The data from the sensor enables the robot to create the two dimensional topological map of unknown environments and stereo vision systems models the three dimension model of the same environment.

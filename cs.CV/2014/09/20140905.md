- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a learning framework for identifying synapses using a deep and wide multi-scale recursive (DAWMR) network, previously considered in image segmentation applications. We apply this approach on electron microscopy data from invertebrate fly brain tissue. By learning features directly from the data, we are able to achieve considerable improvements over existing techniques that rely on a small set of hand-designed features. We show that this system can reduce the amount of manual annotation required, in both acquisition of training data as well as verification of inferred detections.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing neuronal circuits at the level of synapses is a central problem in neuroscience and becoming a focus of the emerging field of connectomics. To date, electron microscopy (EM) is the most proven technique for identifying and quantifying synaptic connections. As advances in EM make acquiring larger datasets possible, subsequent manual synapse identification ({\em i.e.}, proofreading) for deciphering a connectome becomes a major time bottleneck. Here we introduce a large-scale, high-throughput, and semi-automated methodology to efficiently identify synapses. We successfully applied our methodology to the Drosophila medulla optic lobe, annotating many more synapses than previous connectome efforts. Our approaches are extensible and will make the often complicated process of synapse identification accessible to a wider-community of potential proofreaders.

- **Summary**: Mapping the connectivity of neurons in the brain (i.e., connectomics) is a challenging problem due to both the number of connections in even the smallest organisms and the nanometer resolution required to resolve them. Because of this, previous connectomes contain only hundreds of neurons, such as in the C.elegans connectome. Recent technological advances will unlock the mysteries of increasingly large connectomes (or partial connectomes). However, the value of these maps is limited by our ability to reason with this data and understand any underlying motifs. To aid connectome analysis, we introduce algorithms to cluster similarly-shaped neurons, where 3D neuronal shapes are represented as skeletons. In particular, we propose a novel location-sensitive clustering algorithm. We show clustering results on neurons reconstructed from the Drosophila medulla that show high-accuracy.

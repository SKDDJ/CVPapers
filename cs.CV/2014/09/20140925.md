- **Summary**: We study the problem of how to build a deep learning representation for 3D shape. Deep learning has shown to be very effective in variety of visual applications, such as image classification and object detection. However, it has not been successfully applied to 3D shape recognition. This is because 3D shape has complex structure in 3D space and there are limited number of 3D shapes for feature learning. To address these problems, we project 3D shapes into 2D space and use autoencoder for feature learning on the 2D images. High accuracy 3D shape retrieval performance is obtained by aggregating the features learned on 2D images. In addition, we show the proposed deep learning feature is complementary to conventional local image descriptors. By combing the global deep learning representation and the local descriptor representation, our method can obtain the state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape retrieval benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The fly tracking software Ctrax by Branson et al. is popular for positional tracking of animals both within and beyond the fly community. Ctrax was not designed to handle tracking in difficult lighting conditions with strong shadows or recurring "on"/"off" changes in lighting - a condition that will likely become increasingly common due to the advent of red-shifted channelrhodopsin. We describe Ctrax extensions we developed that address this problem. The extensions enabled good tracking accuracy in three types of difficult lighting conditions in our lab. Our technique handling shadows relies on "single animal tracking"; the other techniques should be widely applicable.

- **Summary**: To simplify the parameter of the deep learning network, a cascaded compressive sensing model "CSNet" is implemented for image classification. Firstly, we use cascaded compressive sensing network to learn feature from the data. Secondly, CSNet generates the feature by binary hashing and block-wise histograms. Finally, a linear SVM classifier is used to classify these features. The experiments on the MNIST dataset indicate that higher classification accuracy can be obtained by this algorithm.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new deep learning network "GENet", it combines the multi-layer network architec- ture and graph embedding framework. Firstly, we use simplest unsupervised learning PCA/LDA as first layer to generate the low- level feature. Secondly, many cascaded dimensionality reduction layers based on graph embedding framework are applied to GENet. Finally, a linear SVM classifier is used to classify dimension-reduced features. The experiments indicate that higher classification accuracy can be obtained by this algorithm on the CMU-PIE, ORL, Extended Yale B dataset.

- **Summary**: The null linear discriminant analysis method is a competitive approach for dimensionality reduction. The implementation of this method, however, is computationally expensive. Recently, a fast implementation of null linear discriminant analysis method using random matrix multiplication with scatter matrices was proposed. However, if the random matrix is chosen arbitrarily, the orientation matrix may be rank deficient, and some useful discriminant information will be lost. In this paper, we investigate how to choose the random matrix properly, such that the two criteria of the null LDA method are satisfied theoretically. We give a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee full column rank of the orientation matrix. Moreover, the geometric characterization of the condition is also described.

- **Summary**: Detection of groups of interacting people is a very interesting and useful task in many modern technologies, with application fields spanning from video-surveillance to social robotics. In this paper we first furnish a rigorous definition of group considering the background of the social sciences: this allows us to specify many kinds of group, so far neglected in the Computer Vision literature. On top of this taxonomy, we present a detailed state of the art on the group detection algorithms. Then, as a main contribution, we present a brand new method for the automatic detection of groups in still images, which is based on a graph-cuts framework for clustering individuals; in particular we are able to codify in a computational sense the sociological definition of F-formation, that is very useful to encode a group having only proxemic information: position and orientation of people. We call the proposed method Graph-Cuts for F-formation (GCFF). We show how GCFF definitely outperforms all the state of the art methods in terms of different accuracy measures (some of them are brand new), demonstrating also a strong robustness to noise and versatility in recognizing groups of various cardinality.

- **Summary**: This study formulates the IR target detection as a binary classification problem of each pixel. Each pixel is associated with a label which indicates whether it is a target or background pixel. The optimal label set for all the pixels of an image maximizes aposteriori distribution of label configuration given the pixel intensities. The posterior probability is factored into (or proportional to) a conditional likelihood of the intensity values and a prior probability of label configuration. Each of these two probabilities are computed assuming a Markov Random Field (MRF) on both pixel intensities and their labels. In particular, this study enforces neighborhood dependency on both intensity values, by a Simultaneous Auto Regressive (SAR) model, and on labels, by an Auto-Logistic model. The parameters of these MRF models are learned from labeled examples. During testing, an MRF inference technique, namely Iterated Conditional Mode (ICM), produces the optimal label for each pixel. The detection performance is further improved by incorporating temporal information through background subtraction. High performances on benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness of this method for IR target detection.



### Ambiguity-Driven Fuzzy C-Means Clustering: How to Detect Uncertain Clustered Records

- **Summary**: As a well-known clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) allows each input sample to belong to more than one cluster, providing more flexibility than non-fuzzy clustering methods. However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. They are mainly emerged from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide enough evidence to make a good decision. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate which prevents performance loss compared to similar hybrid methods. Experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved sensitivity of the algorithm.

- **Summary**: A quantum edge detector for image segmentation in optical environments is presented in this work. A Boolean version of the same detector is presented too. The quantum version of the new edge detector works with computational basis states, exclusively. This way, we can easily avoid the problem of quantum measurement retrieving the result of applying the new detector on the image. Besides, a new criterion and logic based on projections onto vertical axis of Bloch's Sphere exclusively are presented too. This approach will allow us: 1) a simpler development of logic quantum operations, where they will closer to those used in the classical logic operations, 2) building simple and robust classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical interfaces. Said so far is extended to quantum algorithms outside image processing too. In a special section on metric and simulations, a new metric based on the comparison between the classical and quantum versions algorithms for edge detection of images is presented. Notable differences between the results of classical and quantum versions of such algorithms (outside and inside of quantum computer, respectively) show the existence of implementation problems involved in the experiment, and that they have not been properly modeled for optical environments. However, although they are different, the quantum results are equally valid. The latter is clearly seen in the computer simulations

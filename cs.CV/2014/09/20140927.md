- **Summary**: Despite surveillance systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our living environment, automated surveillance, currently based on video sensory modality and machine intelligence, lacks most of the time the robustness and reliability required in several real applications. To tackle this issue, audio sensory devices have been taken into account, both alone or in combination with video, giving birth, in the last decade, to a considerable amount of research. In this paper audio-based automated surveillance methods are organized into a comprehensive survey: a general taxonomy, inspired by the more widespread video surveillance field, is proposed in order to systematically describe the methods covering background subtraction, event classification, object tracking and situation analysis. For each of these tasks, all the significant works are reviewed, detailing their pros and cons and the context for which they have been proposed. Moreover, a specific section is devoted to audio features, discussing their expressiveness and their employment in the above described tasks. Differently, from other surveys on audio processing and analysis, the present one is specifically targeted to automated surveillance, highlighting the target applications of each described methods and providing the reader tables and schemes useful to retrieve the most suited algorithms for a specific requirement.

- **Summary**: Feature selection with large-scale high-dimensional data is important yet very challenging in machine learning and data mining. Online feature selection is a promising new paradigm that is more efficient and scalable than batch feature section methods, but the existing online approaches usually fall short in their inferior efficacy as compared with batch approaches. In this paper, we present a novel second-order online feature selection scheme that is simple yet effective, very fast and extremely scalable to deal with large-scale ultra-high dimensional sparse data streams. The basic idea is to improve the existing first-order online feature selection methods by exploiting second-order information for choosing the subset of important features with high confidence weights. However, unlike many second-order learning methods that often suffer from extra high computational cost, we devise a novel smart algorithm for second-order online feature selection using a MaxHeap-based approach, which is not only more effective than the existing first-order approaches, but also significantly more efficient and scalable for large-scale feature selection with ultra-high dimensional sparse data, as validated from our extensive experiments. Impressively, on a billion-scale synthetic dataset (1-billion dimensions, 1-billion nonzero features, and 1-million samples), our new algorithm took only 8 minutes on a single PC, which is orders of magnitudes faster than traditional batch approaches. \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7794}

- **Summary**: Biometric-based identification has drawn a lot of attention in the recent years. Among all biometrics, palmprint is known to possess a rich set of features. In this paper we have proposed to use DCT-based features in parallel with wavelet-based ones for palmprint identification. PCA is applied to the features to reduce their dimensionality and the majority voting algorithm is used to perform classification. The features introduced here result in a near-perfectly accurate identification. This method is tested on a well-known multispectral palmprint database and an accuracy rate of 99.97-100\% is achieved, outperforming all previous methods in similar conditions.

- **Summary**: We present a novel, real-time algorithm to track the trajectory of each pedestrian in moderately dense crowded scenes. Our formulation is based on an adaptive particle-filtering scheme that uses a combination of various multi-agent heterogeneous pedestrian simulation models. We automatically compute the optimal parameters for each of these different models based on prior tracked data and use the best model as motion prior for our particle-filter based tracking algorithm. We also use our "mixture of motion models" for adaptive particle selection and accelerate the performance of the online tracking algorithm. The motion model parameter estimation is formulated as an optimization problem, and we use an approach that solves this combinatorial optimization problem in a model independent manner and hence scalable to any multi-agent pedestrian motion model. We evaluate the performance of our approach on different crowd video datasets and highlight the improvement in accuracy over homogeneous motion models and a baseline mean-shift based tracker. In practice, our formulation can compute trajectories of tens of pedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU in in real time and offer higher accuracy as compared to prior real time pedestrian tracking algorithms.

- **Summary**: Fractal analysis has been shown to be useful in image processing for characterizing shape and gray-scale complexity. The fractal feature is a compact descriptor used to give a numerical measure of the degree of irregularity of the medical images. This descriptor property does not give ownership of the local image structure. In this paper, we present a combination of this parameter based on Box Counting with GLCM Features. This powerful combination has proved good results especially in classification of medical texture from MRI and CT Scan images of trabecular bone. This method has the potential to improve clinical diagnostics tests for osteoporosis pathologies.

- **Summary**: This paper constitutes an extension to the report on DISA-MU team participation in the ImageCLEF 2014 Scalable Concept Image Annotation Task as published in [3]. Specifically, we introduce a new similarity search component that was implemented into the system, report on the results achieved by utilizing this component, and analyze the influence of different similarity search parameters on the annotation quality.

- **Summary**: Sparse Filtering is a popular feature learning algorithm for image classification pipelines. In this paper, we connect the performance of Sparse Filtering with spectral properties of the corresponding feature matrices. This connection provides new insights into Sparse Filtering; in particular, it suggests early stopping of Sparse Filtering. We therefore introduce the Optimal Roundness Criterion (ORC), a novel stopping criterion for Sparse Filtering. We show that this stopping criterion is related with pre-processing procedures such as Statistical Whitening and demonstrate that it can make image classification with Sparse Filtering considerably faster and more accurate.

- **Summary**: Circle detection over digital images has received considerable attention from the computer vision community over the last few years devoting a tremendous amount of research seeking for an optimal detector. This article presents an algorithm for the automatic detection of circular shapes from complicated and noisy images with no consideration of conventional Hough transform principles. The proposed algorithm is based on Learning Automata (LA) which is a probabilistic optimization method that explores an unknown random environment by progressively improving the performance via a reinforcement signal (objective function). The approach uses the encoding of three non-collinear points as a candidate circle over the edge image. A reinforcement signal (matching function) indicates if such candidate circles are actually present in the edge map. Guided by the values of such reinforcement signal, the probability set of the encoded candidate circles is modified through the LA algorithm so that they can fit to the actual circles on the edge map. Experimental results over several complex synthetic and natural images have validated the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding accuracy, speed and robustness.

- **Summary**: Hough transform (HT) has been the most common method for circle detection exhibiting robustness but adversely demanding a considerable computational load and large storage. Alternative approaches include heuristic methods that employ iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple circles under the inconvenience that only one circle can be marked at each optimization cycle demanding a longer execution time. On the other hand, Learning Automata (LA) is a heuristic method to solve complex multi-modal optimization problems. Although LA converges to just one global minimum, the final probability distribution holds valuable information regarding other local minima which have emerged during the optimization process. The detection process is considered as a multi-modal optimization problem, allowing the detection of multiple circular shapes through only one optimization procedure. The algorithm uses a combination of three edge points as parameters to determine circles candidates. A reinforcement signal determines if such circle candidates are actually present at the image. Guided by the values of such reinforcement signal, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved using the LA so that they can fit into actual circular shapes over the edge-only map of the image. The overall approach is a fast multiple-circle detector despite facing complicated conditions.

- **Summary**: Reliable corner detection is an important task in determining the shape of different regions within an image. Real-life image data are always imprecise due to inherent uncertainties that may arise from the imaging process such as defocusing, illumination changes, noise, etc. Therefore, the localization and detection of corners has become a difficult task to accomplish under such imperfect situations. On the other hand, Fuzzy systems are well known for their efficient handling of impreciseness and incompleteness, which make them inherently suitable for modelling corner properties by means of a rule-based fuzzy system. The paper presents a corner detection algorithm which employs such fuzzy reasoning. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is compared to well-known conventional corner detectors and its performance is also tested over a number of benchmark images to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm under uncertainty.

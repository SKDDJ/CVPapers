- **Summary**: The study evaluates three background subtraction techniques. The techniques ranges from very basic algorithm to state of the art published techniques categorized based on speed, memory requirements and accuracy. Such a review can effectively guide the designer to select the most suitable method for a given application in a principled way. The algorithms used in the study ranges from varying levels of accuracy and computational complexity. Few of them can also deal with real time challenges like rain, snow, hails, swaying branches, objects overlapping, varying light intensity or slow moving objects.

- **Summary**: In this paper the technique for resolution and contrast enhancement of satellite geographical images based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT), stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) has been proposed. In this, the noise is added in the input low resolution and low contrast image. The median filter is used remove noise from the input image. This low resolution, low contrast image without noise is decomposed into four sub-bands by using DWT and SWT. The resolution enhancement technique is based on the interpolation of high frequency components obtained by DWT and input image. SWT is used to enhance input image. DWT is used to decompose an image into four frequency sub bands and these four sub-bands are interpolated using bicubic interpolation technique. All these sub-bands are reconstructed as high resolution image by using inverse DWT (IDWT). To increase the contrast the proposed technique uses DWT and SVD. GHE is used to equalize an image. The equalized image is decomposed into four sub-bands using DWT and new LL sub-band is reconstructed using SVD. All sub-bands are reconstructed using IDWT to generate high resolution and contrast image over conventional techniques. The experimental result shows superiority of the proposed technique over conventional techniques.   Key words: Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), General histogram equalization (GHE), Median filter, Singular value decomposition (SVD), Stationary wavelet transform (SWT).

- **Summary**: We propose a method to improve image clustering using sparse text and the wisdom of the crowds. In particular, we present a method to fuse two different kinds of document features, image and text features, and use a common dictionary or "wisdom of the crowds" as the connection between the two different kinds of documents. With the proposed fusion matrix, we use topic modeling via non-negative matrix factorization to cluster documents.

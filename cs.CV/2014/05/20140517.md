- **Summary**: Video surveillance has long been in use to monitor security sensitive areas such as banks, department stores, highways, crowded public places and borders.The advance in computing power, availability of large-capacity storage devices and high speed network infrastructure paved the way for cheaper, multi-sensor video surveillance systems.Traditionally, the video outputs are processed online by human operators and are usually saved to tapes for later use only after a forensic event.The increase in the number of cameras in ordinary surveillance systems overloaded both the human operators and the storage devices with high volumes of data and made it in-feasible to ensure proper monitoring of sensitive areas for long times.

- **Summary**: Inter-frame Coding plays significant role for video Compression and Computer Vision. Computer vision systems have been incorporated in many real life applications (e.g. surveillance systems, medical imaging, robot navigation and identity verification systems). Object tracking is a key computer vision topic, which aims at detecting the position of a moving object from a video sequence. The application of Inter-frame Coding for low frame rate video, as well as for low resolution video. Various methods based on Top-down approach just like kernel based or mean shift technique are used to track the object for video, So, Inter-frame Coding algorithms are widely adopted by video coding standards, mainly due to their simplicity and good distortion performance for object tracking.

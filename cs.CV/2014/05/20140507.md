- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of identifying a very small subset of data points that belong to a significantly larger massive dataset (i.e., Big Data). The small number of selected data points must adequately represent and faithfully characterize the massive Big Data. Such identification process is known as representative selection [19]. We propose a novel representative selection framework by generating an l1 norm sparse graph for a given Big-Data dataset. The Big Data is partitioned recursively into clusters using a spectral clustering algorithm on the generated sparse graph. We consider each cluster as one point in a Grassmann manifold, and measure the geodesic distance among these points. The distances are further analyzed using a min-max algorithm [1] to extract an optimal subset of clusters. Finally, by considering a sparse subgraph of each selected cluster, we detect a representative using principal component centrality [11]. We refer to the proposed representative selection framework as a Sparse Graph and Grassmann Manifold (SGGM) based approach. To validate the proposed SGGM framework, we apply it onto the problem of video summarization where only few video frames, known as key frames, are selected among a much longer video sequence. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed algorithm with the ground truth, which is agreed by multiple human judges, and with some state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability of the SGGM framework.

- **Summary**: Separating an image into cartoon and texture components comes useful in image processing applications, such as image compression, image segmentation, image inpainting. Yves Meyer's influential cartoon texture decomposition model involves deriving an energy functional by choosing appropriate spaces and functionals. Minimizers of the derived energy functional are cartoon and texture components of an image. In this study, cartoon part of an image is separated, by reconstructing it from pixels of multi scale Total-Variation filtered versions of the original image which is sought to be decomposed into cartoon and texture parts. An information theoretic pixel by pixel selection criteria is employed to choose the contributing pixels and their scales.

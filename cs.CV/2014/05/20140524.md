- **Summary**: Correspondence is a ubiquitous problem in computer vision and graph matching has been a natural way to formalize correspondence as an optimization problem. Recently, graph matching solvers have included higher-order terms representing affinities beyond the unary and pairwise level. Such higher-order terms have a particular appeal for geometric constraints that include three or more correspondences like the PnP 2D-3D pose problems. In this paper, we address the problem of finding correspondences in the absence of unary or pairwise constraints as it emerges in problems where unary appearance similarity like SIFT matches is not available. Current higher order matching approaches have targeted problems where higher order affinity can simply be formulated as a difference of invariances such as lengths, angles, or cross-ratios. In this paper, we present a method of how to apply geometric constraints modeled as polynomial equation systems. As opposed to RANSAC where such systems have to be solved and then tested for inlier hypotheses, our constraints are derived as a single affinity weight based on $n>2$ hypothesized correspondences without solving the polynomial system. Since the result is directly a correspondence without a transformation model, our approach supports correspondence matching in the presence of multiple geometric transforms like articulated motions.

- **Summary**: Change detection plays an important role in most video-based applications. The first stage is to build appropriate background model, which is now becoming increasingly complex as more sophisticated statistical approaches are introduced to cover challenging situations and provide reliable detection. This paper reports a simple and intuitive statistical model based on deeper learning spatial correlation among pixels: For each observed pixel, we select a group of supporting pixels with high correlation, and then use a single Gaussian to model the intensity deviations between the observed pixel and the supporting ones. In addition, a multi-channel model updating is integrated on-line and a temporal intensity constraint for each pixel is defined. Although this method is mainly designed for coping with sudden illumination changes, experimental results using all the video sequences provided on changedetection.net validate it is comparable with other recent methods under various situations.

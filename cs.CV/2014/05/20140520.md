- **Summary**: Diseases in fruit cause devastating problem in economic losses and production in agricultural industry worldwide. In this paper, an adaptive approach for the identification of fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. The image processing based proposed approach is composed of the following main steps; in the first step K-Means clustering technique is used for the defect segmentation, in the second step some state of the art features are extracted from the segmented image, and finally images are classified into one of the classes by using a Multi-class Support Vector Machine. We have considered diseases of apple as a test case and evaluated our approach for three types of apple diseases namely apple scab, apple blotch and apple rot. Our experimental results express that the proposed solution can significantly support accurate detection and automatic identification of fruit diseases. The classification accuracy for the proposed solution is achieved up to 93%.

- **Summary**: Two complementary approaches have been extensively used in signal and image processing leading to novel results, the sparse representation methodology and the variational strategy. Recently, a new sparsity based model has been proposed, the cosparse analysis framework, which may potentially help in bridging sparse approximation based methods to the traditional total-variation minimization. Based on this, we introduce a sparsity based framework for solving overparameterized variational problems. The latter has been used to improve the estimation of optical flow and also for general denoising of signals and images. However, the recovery of the space varying parameters involved was not adequately addressed by traditional variational methods. We first demonstrate the efficiency of the new framework for one dimensional signals in recovering a piecewise linear and polynomial function. Then, we illustrate how the new technique can be used for denoising and segmentation of images.

- **Summary**: Traditional approaches to upper body pose estimation using monocular vision rely on complex body models and a large variety of geometric constraints. We argue that this is not ideal and somewhat inelegant as it results in large processing burdens, and instead attempt to incorporate these constraints through priors obtained directly from training data. A prior distribution covering the probability of a human pose occurring is used to incorporate likely human poses. This distribution is obtained offline, by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to a large dataset of recorded human body poses, tracked using a Kinect sensor. We combine this prior information with a random walk transition model to obtain an upper body model, suitable for use within a recursive Bayesian filtering framework. Our model can be viewed as a mixture of discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, in that states behave as random walks, but drift towards a set of typically observed poses. This model is combined with measurements of the human head and hand positions, using recursive Bayesian estimation to incorporate temporal information. Measurements are obtained using face detection and a simple skin colour hand detector, trained using the detected face. The suggested model is designed with analytical tractability in mind and we show that the pose tracking can be Rao-Blackwellised using the mixture Kalman filter, allowing for computational efficiency while still incorporating bio-mechanical properties of the upper body. In addition, the use of the proposed upper body model allows reliable three-dimensional pose estimates to be obtained indirectly for a number of joints that are often difficult to detect using traditional object recognition strategies. Comparisons with Kinect sensor results and the state of the art in 2D pose estimation highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel and effective technique for extracting multiple ellipses from an image. The approach employs an evolutionary algorithm to mimic the way animals behave collectively assuming the overall detection process as a multi-modal optimization problem. In the algorithm, searcher agents emulate a group of animals that interact to each other using simple biological rules which are modeled as evolutionary operators. In turn, such operators are applied to each agent considering that the complete group has a memory to store optimal solutions (ellipses) seen so-far by applying a competition principle. The detector uses a combination of five edge points as parameters to determine ellipse candidates (possible solutions) while a matching function determines if such ellipse candidates are actually present in the image. Guided by the values of such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate ellipses are evolved through the evolutionary algorithm so that the best candidates can be fitted into the actual ellipses within the image. Just after the optimization process ends, an analysis over the embedded memory is executed in order to find the best obtained solution (the best ellipse) and significant local minima (remaining ellipses). Experimental results over several complex synthetic and natural images have validated the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding accuracy, speed and robustness.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new probabilistic graphical model used to model and recognize words representing the names of Tunisian cities. In fact, this work is based on a dynamic hierarchical Bayesian network. The aim is to find the best model of Arabic handwriting to reduce the complexity of the recognition process by permitting the partial recognition. Actually, we propose a segmentation of the word based on smoothing the vertical histogram projection using different width values to reduce the error of segmentation. Then, we extract the characteristics of each cell using the Zernike and HU moments, which are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. Our approach is tested using the IFN / ENIT database, and the experiment results are very promising.

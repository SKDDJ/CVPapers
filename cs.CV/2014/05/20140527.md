- **Summary**: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with group sparsity constraints is formulated as a probabilistic graphical model and, assuming some observed data have been generated by the model, a feasible variational Bayesian algorithm is derived for learning model parameters. When used in a supervised learning scenario, NMF is most often utilized as an unsupervised feature extractor followed by classification in the obtained feature subspace. Having mapped the class labels to a more general concept of groups which underlie sparsity of the coefficients, what the proposed group sparse NMF model allows is incorporating class label information to find low dimensional label-driven dictionaries which not only aim to represent the data faithfully, but are also suitable for class discrimination. Experiments performed in face recognition and facial expression recognition domains point to advantages of classification in such label-driven feature subspaces over classification in feature subspaces obtained in an unsupervised manner.

- **Summary**: Despite the success of the popular kernelized support vector machines, they have two major limitations: they are restricted to Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) kernels, and their training complexity scales at least quadratically with the size of the data. Many natural measures of similarity between pairs of samples are not PSD e.g. invariant kernels, and those that are implicitly or explicitly defined by latent variable models. In this paper, we investigate scalable approaches for using indefinite similarity measures in large margin frameworks. In particular we show that a normalization of similarity to a subset of the data points constitutes a representation suitable for linear classifiers. The result is a classifier which is competitive to kernelized SVM in terms of accuracy, despite having better training and test time complexities. Experimental results demonstrate that on CIFAR-10 dataset, the model equipped with similarity measures invariant to rigid and non-rigid deformations, can be made more than 5 times sparser while being more accurate than kernelized SVM using RBF kernels.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a reliable method for detecting human faces in color images is proposed. This system firstly detects skin color in YCgCr and YIQ color space, then filters binary texture and the result is morphological processed, finally converts skin tone to the preferred skin color configured by users in YIQ color space. The real-time adjusting circuit is implemented and some of simulation results are given out. Experimental results demonstrate that the method has achieved high rates and low false positives, another advantage is its simplicity and minor computational costs.

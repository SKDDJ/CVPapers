- **Summary**: While low-level image features have proven to be effective representations for visual recognition tasks such as object recognition and scene classification, they are inadequate to capture complex semantic meaning required to solve high-level visual tasks such as multimedia event detection and recognition. Recognition or retrieval of events and activities can be improved if specific discriminative objects are detected in a video sequence. In this paper, we propose an image representation, called Detection Bank, based on the detection images from a large number of windowed object detectors where an image is represented by different statistics derived from these detections. This representation is extended to video by aggregating the key frame level image representations through mean and max pooling. We empirically show that it captures complementary information to state-of-the-art representations such as Spatial Pyramid Matching and Object Bank. These descriptors combined with our Detection Bank representation significantly outperforms any of the representations alone on TRECVID MED 2011 data.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the use of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to compute threshold selection for image segmentation. ABC is a heuristic algorithm motivated by the intelligent behavior of honey-bees which has been successfully employed to solve complex optimization problems. In this approach, an image 1D histogram is approximated through a Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are calculated by the ABC algorithm. For the approximation scheme, each Gaussian function represents a pixel class and therefore a threshold. Unlike the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, the ABC based method shows fast convergence and low sensitivity to initial conditions. Remarkably, it also improves complex time consuming computations commonly required by gradient-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithms ability to perform automatic multi threshold selection yet showing interesting advantages by comparison to other well known algorithms.

- **Summary**: Automatic circle detection in digital images has received considerable attention over the last years in computer vision as several efforts have aimed for an optimal circle detector. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of circular shapes that considers the overall process as an optimization problem. The approach is based on the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA), a derivative free meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by musicians while improvising new harmonies. The algorithm uses the encoding of three points as candidate circles (harmonies) over the edge-only image. An objective function evaluates (harmony quality) if such candidate circles are actually present in the edge image. Guided by the values of this objective function, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved using the HSA so that they can fit to the actual circles on the edge map of the image (optimal harmony). Experimental results from several tests on synthetic and natural images with a varying complexity range have been included to validate the efficiency of the proposed technique regarding accuracy, speed and robustness.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the use of the Learning Automata (LA) algorithm to compute threshold selection for image segmentation as it is a critical preprocessing step for image analysis, pattern recognition and computer vision. LA is a heuristic method which is able to solve complex optimization problems with interesting results in parameter estimation. Despite other techniques commonly seek through the parameter map, LA explores in the probability space providing appropriate convergence properties and robustness. The segmentation task is therefore considered as an optimization problem and the LA is used to generate the image multi-threshold separation. In this approach, one 1D histogram of a given image is approximated through a Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are calculated using the LA algorithm. Each Gaussian function approximating the histogram represents a pixel class and therefore a threshold point. The method shows fast convergence avoiding the typical sensitivity to initial conditions such as the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm or the complex time-consuming computations commonly found in gradient methods. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm ability to perform automatic multi-threshold selection and show interesting advantages as it is compared to other algorithms solving the same task.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a circle detection method based on Differential Evolution (DE) optimization. Just as circle detection has been lately considered as a fundamental component for many computer vision algorithms, DE has evolved as a successful heuristic method for solving complex optimization problems, still keeping a simple structure and an easy implementation. It has also shown advantageous convergence properties and remarkable robustness. The detection process is considered similar to a combinational optimization problem. The algorithm uses the combination of three edge points as parameters to determine circles candidates in the scene yielding a reduction of the search space. The objective function determines if some circle candidates are actually present in the image. This paper focuses particularly on one DE-based algorithm known as the Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE), which eventually has shown better results than the original DE in particular for solving combinatorial problems. In the DDE, suitable conversion routines are incorporated into the DE, aiming to operate from integer values to real values and then getting integer values back, following the crossover operation. The final algorithm is a fast circle detector that locates circles with sub-pixel accuracy even considering complicated conditions and noisy images. Experimental results on several synthetic and natural images with varying range of complexity validate the efficiency of the proposed technique considering accuracy, speed, and robustness.

- **Summary**: In the field of image analysis, segmentation is one of the most important preprocessing steps. One way to achieve segmentation is by mean of threshold selection, where each pixel that belongs to a determined class islabeled according to the selected threshold, giving as a result pixel groups that share visual characteristics in the image. Several methods have been proposed in order to solve threshold selectionproblems; in this work, it is used the method based on the mixture of Gaussian functions to approximate the 1D histogram of a gray level image and whose parameters are calculated using three nature inspired algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony Optimization and Differential Evolution). Each Gaussian function approximates thehistogram, representing a pixel class and therefore a threshold point. Experimental results are shown, comparing in quantitative and qualitative fashion as well as the main advantages and drawbacks of each algorithm, applied to multi-threshold problem.

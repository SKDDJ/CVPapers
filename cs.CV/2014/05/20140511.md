- **Summary**: This paper proposes a strategy for the detection and triangulation of structural anomalies in solid media. The method revolves around the construction of sparse representations of the medium's dynamic response, obtained by learning instructive dictionaries which form a suitable basis for the response data. The resulting sparse coding problem is recast as a modified dictionary learning task with additional spatial sparsity constraints enforced on the atoms of the learned dictionaries, which provides them with a prescribed spatial topology that is designed to unveil anomalous regions in the physical domain. The proposed methodology is model agnostic, i.e., it forsakes the need for a physical model and requires virtually no a priori knowledge of the structure's material properties, as all the inferences are exclusively informed by the data through the layers of information that are available in the intrinsic salient structure of the material's dynamic response. This characteristic makes the approach powerful for anomaly identification in systems with unknown or heterogeneous property distribution, for which a model is unsuitable or unreliable. The method is validated using both synthetically

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel strategy for high-fidelity image restoration by characterizing both local smoothness and nonlocal self-similarity of natural images in a unified statistical manner. The main contributions are three-folds. First, from the perspective of image statistics, a joint statistical modeling (JSM) in an adaptive hybrid space-transform domain is established, which offers a powerful mechanism of combining local smoothness and nonlocal self-similarity simultaneously to ensure a more reliable and robust estimation. Second, a new form of minimization functional for solving image inverse problem is formulated using JSM under regularization-based framework. Finally, in order to make JSM tractable and robust, a new Split-Bregman based algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the above severely underdetermined inverse problem associated with theoretical proof of convergence. Extensive experiments on image inpainting, image deblurring and mixed Gaussian plus salt-and-pepper noise removal applications verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: Image Mosaicing is a method of constructing multiple images of the same scene into a larger image. The output of the image mosaic will be the union of two input images. Image-mosaicing algorithms are used to get mosaiced image. Image Mosaicing processed is basically divided in to 5 phases. Which includes; Feature point extraction, Image registration, Homography computation, Warping and Blending if Image. Various corner detection algorithm is being used for Feature extraction. This corner produces an efficient and informative output mosaiced image. Image mosaicing is widely used in creating 3D images, medical imaging, computer vision, data from satellites, and military automatic target recognition.

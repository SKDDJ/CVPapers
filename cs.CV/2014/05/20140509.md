- **Summary**: Image segmentation and image restoration are two important topics in image processing with great achievements. In this paper, we propose a new multiphase segmentation model by combining image restoration and image segmentation models. Utilizing image restoration aspects, the proposed segmentation model can effectively and robustly tackle high noisy images, blurry images, images with missing pixels, and vector-valued images. In particular, one of the most important segmentation models, the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model, can be extended easily in this way to segment gray and vector-valued images corrupted for example by noise, blur or missing pixels after coupling a new data fidelity term which comes from image restoration topics. It can be solved efficiently using the alternating minimization algorithm, and we prove the convergence of this algorithm with three variables under mild condition. Experiments on many synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that our method gives better segmentation results in comparison to others state-of-the-art segmentation models especially for blurry images and images with missing pixels values.

- **Summary**: Digital Elevation models (DEM) are images having terrain information embedded into them. Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be marked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate environments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level encapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge and layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based approach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships between objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive mapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM registration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding, Euclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for transformation and change detection. Landmarks have been categorized to belong to either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights; peaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to the flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in DEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. Fractal based compression was used for storage of co-registered DEMs. This method may further be extended for DEM-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image registration. Experimental results further cement the fact that DEM registration may be effectively done using the proposed method.

- **Summary**: We propose a new heavy-tailed distribution --- Gaussian-Chain (GC) distribution, which is inspirited by the hierarchical structures prevailing in social organizations. We determine the mean, variance and kurtosis of the Gaussian-Chain distribution to show its heavy-tailed property, and compute the tail distribution table to give specific numbers showing how heavy is the heavy-tails. To filter out the heavy-tailed noise, we construct two filters --- 2nd and 3rd-order GC filters --- based on the maximum likelihood principle. Simulation results show that the GC filters perform much better than the benchmark least-squares algorithm when the noise is heavy-tail distributed. Using the GC filters, we propose a trading strategy, named Ride-the-Mood, to follow the mood of the market by detecting the actions of the big buyers and the big sellers in the market based on the noisy, heavy-tailed price data. Application of the Ride-the-Mood strategy to five blue-chip Hong Kong stocks over the recent two-year period from April 2, 2012 to March 31, 2014 shows that their returns are higher than the returns of the benchmark Buy-and-Hold strategy and the Hang Seng Index Fund.

- **Summary**: Face recognition is a widely used biometric approach. Face recognition technology has developed rapidly in recent years and it is more direct, user friendly and convenient compared to other methods. But face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by non-real faces. It is an easy way to spoof face recognition systems by facial pictures such as portrait photographs. A secure system needs Liveness detection in order to guard against such spoofing. In this work, face liveness detection approaches are categorized based on the various types techniques used for liveness detection. This categorization helps understanding different spoof attacks scenarios and their relation to the developed solutions. A review of the latest works regarding face liveness detection works is presented. The main aim is to provide a simple path for the future development of novel and more secured face liveness detection approach.

- **Summary**: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has proved effective in many clustering and classification tasks. The classic ways to measure the errors between the original and the reconstructed matrix are $l_2$ distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, nonlinear cases are not properly handled when we use these error measures. As a consequence, alternative measures based on nonlinear kernels, such as correntropy, are proposed. However, the current correntropy-based NMF only targets on the low-level features without considering the intrinsic geometrical distribution of data. In this paper, we propose a new NMF algorithm that preserves local invariance by adding graph regularization into the process of max-correntropy-based matrix factorization. Meanwhile, each feature can learn corresponding kernel from the data. The experiment results of Caltech101 and Caltech256 show the benefits of such combination against other NMF algorithms for the unsupervised image clustering.

- **Summary**: Feature tracking in video is a crucial task in computer vision. Usually, the tracking problem is handled one feature at a time, using a single-feature tracker like the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm, or one of its derivatives. While this approach works quite well when dealing with high-quality video and "strong" features, it often falters when faced with dark and noisy video containing low-quality features. We present a framework for jointly tracking a set of features, which enables sharing information between the different features in the scene. We show that our method can be employed to track features for both rigid and nonrigid motions (possibly of few moving bodies) even when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can be used to significantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there is a mix of good and bad features). Our approach does not require direct modeling of the structure or the motion of the scene, and runs in real time on a single CPU core.

- **Summary**: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is observed at multiple levels of neural systems, and has been shown to play an important function in visual perception. We propose a computing system based on locally coupled oscillator networks for image segmentation. The system can serve as the preprocessing front-end of an image processing pipeline where the common frequencies of clusters of oscillators reflect the segmentation results. To demonstrate the feasibility of our design, the system is simulated and tested on a human face image dataset and its performance is compared with traditional intensity threshold based algorithms. Our system shows both better performance and higher noise tolerance than traditional methods.

- **Summary**: Recently regression analysis becomes a popular tool for face recognition. The existing regression methods all use the one-dimensional pixel-based error model, which characterizes the representation error pixel by pixel individually and thus neglects the whole structure of the error image. We observe that occlusion and illumination changes generally lead to a low-rank error image. To make use of this low-rank structural information, this paper presents a two-dimensional image matrix based error model, i.e. matrix regression, for face representation and classification. Our model uses the minimal nuclear norm of representation error image as a criterion, and the alternating direction method of multipliers method to calculate the regression coefficients. Compared with the current regression methods, the proposed Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (NMR) model is more robust for alleviating the effect of illumination, and more intuitive and powerful for removing the structural noise caused by occlusion. We experiment using four popular face image databases, the Extended Yale B database, the AR database, the Multi-PIE and the FRGC database. Experimental results demonstrate the performance advantage of NMR over the state-of-the-art regression based face recognition methods.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of estimating the pose of humans using RGB image input. More specifically, we are using a random forest classifier to classify pixels into joint-based body part categories, much similar to the famous Kinect pose estimator [11], [12]. However, we are using pure RGB input, i.e. no depth. Since the random forest requires a large number of training examples, we are using computer graphics generated, synthetic training data. In addition, we assume that we have access to a large number of real images with bounding box labels, extracted for example by a pedestrian detector or a tracking system. We propose a new objective function for random forest training that uses the weakly labeled data from the target domain to encourage the learner to select features that generalize from the synthetic source domain to the real target domain. We demonstrate on a publicly available dataset [6] that the proposed objective function yields a classifier that significantly outperforms a baseline classifier trained using the standard entropy objective [10].

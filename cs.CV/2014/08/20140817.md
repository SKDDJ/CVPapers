- **Summary**: Existing techniques for 3D action recognition are sensitive to viewpoint variations because they extract features from depth images which change significantly with viewpoint. In contrast, we directly process the pointclouds and propose a new technique for action recognition which is more robust to noise, action speed and viewpoint variations. Our technique consists of a novel descriptor and keypoint detection algorithm. The proposed descriptor is extracted at a point by encoding the Histogram of Oriented Principal Components (HOPC) within an adaptive spatio-temporal support volume around that point. Based on this descriptor, we present a novel method to detect Spatio-Temporal Key-Points (STKPs) in 3D pointcloud sequences. Experimental results show that the proposed descriptor and STKP detector outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on three benchmark human activity datasets. We also introduce a new multiview public dataset and show the robustness of our proposed method to viewpoint variations.

- **Summary**: We propose an action classification algorithm which uses Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) to capture discriminative information of human body variations in each spatiotemporal subsequence of a video sequence. Our proposed method divides the input video into equally spaced overlapping spatiotemporal subsequences, each of which is decomposed into blocks and then cells. We use the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG3D) feature to encode the information in each cell. We justify the use of LLC for encoding the block descriptor by demonstrating its superiority over Sparse Coding (SC). Our sequence descriptor is obtained via a logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization. We evaluate and compare our algorithm with ten state-of-the-art algorithms on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that, on average, our algorithm gives better accuracy than these ten algorithms.

- **Summary**: Human pose estimation is one of the key problems in computer vision that has been studied in the recent years. The significance of human pose estimation is in the higher level tasks of understanding human actions applications such as recognition of anomalous actions present in videos and many other related applications. The human poses can be estimated by extracting silhouettes of humans as silhouettes are robust to variations and it gives the shape information of the human body. Some common challenges include illumination changes, variation in environments, and variation in human appearances. Thus there is a need for a robust method for human pose estimation. This paper presents a study and analysis of approaches existing for silhouette extraction and proposes a robust technique for extracting human silhouettes in video sequences. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) A statistical approach is combined with HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) color space model for a robust background model that is used for background subtraction to produce foreground blobs, called human silhouettes. Morphological operations are then performed on foreground blobs from background subtraction. The silhouettes obtained from this work can be used in further tasks associated with human action interpretation and activity processes like human action classification, human pose estimation and action recognition or action interpretation.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes the design of decision models based on Computational Intelligence techniques applied to image sequences of dynamic laser speckle. These models aim to identify image regions of biological specimens illuminated by a coherent beam coming from a laser. The field image is pseudo colored using a Self Organizing Map projection. This process is carried out using a set of descriptors applied to the intensity variations along time in every pixel of an image sequence. The models use descriptors selected to improve effectiveness, depending on the specific application. We present two examples of the application of the proposed techniques to assess biological tissues. The results obtained are encouraging and significantly improve those obtained using a single descriptor.

- **Summary**: We evaluate a version of the recently-proposed classification system named Optimized Dissimilarity Space Embedding (ODSE) that operates in the input space of sequences of generic objects. The ODSE system has been originally presented as a classification system for patterns represented as labeled graphs. However, since ODSE is founded on the dissimilarity space representation of the input data, the classifier can be easily adapted to any input domain where it is possible to define a meaningful dissimilarity measure. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODSE classifier for sequences by considering an application dealing with the recognition of the solubility degree of the Escherichia coli proteome. Solubility, or analogously aggregation propensity, is an important property of protein molecules, which is intimately related to the mechanisms underlying the chemico-physical process of folding. Each protein of our dataset is initially associated with a solubility degree and it is represented as a sequence of symbols, denoting the 20 amino acid residues. The herein obtained computational results, which we stress that have been achieved with no context-dependent tuning of the ODSE system, confirm the validity and generality of the ODSE-based approach for structured data classification.

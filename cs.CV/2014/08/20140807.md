- **Summary**: This paper presented a face detection system using Radial Basis Function Neural Networks With Fixed Spread Value. Face detection is the first step in face recognition system. The purpose is to localize and extract the face region from the background that will be fed into the face recognition system for identification. General preprocessing approach was used for normalizing the image and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network was used to distinguish between face and non-face. RBF Neural Networks offer several advantages compared to other neural network architecture such as they can be trained using fast two stages training algorithm and the network possesses the property of best approximation. The output of the network can be optimized by setting suitable value of center and spread of the RBF. In this paper, fixed spread value will be used. The Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) used to distinguish faces and non-faces and the evaluation of the system will be the performance of detection, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and the discriminative properties.

- **Summary**: At the present time, hand gestures recognition system could be used as a more expected and useable approach for human computer interaction. Automatic hand gesture recognition system provides us a new tactic for interactive with the virtual environment. In this paper, a face and hand gesture recognition system which is able to control computer media player is offered. Hand gesture and human face are the key element to interact with the smart system. We used the face recognition scheme for viewer verification and the hand gesture recognition in mechanism of computer media player, for instance, volume down/up, next music and etc. In the proposed technique, first, the hand gesture and face location is extracted from the main image by combination of skin and cascade detector and then is sent to recognition stage. In recognition stage, first, the threshold condition is inspected then the extracted face and gesture will be recognized. In the result stage, the proposed technique is applied on the video dataset and the high precision ratio acquired. Additional the recommended hand gesture recognition method is applied on static American Sign Language (ASL) database and the correctness rate achieved nearby 99.40%. also the planned method could be used in gesture based computer games and virtual reality.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel affine-invariant feature based on SIFT, leveraging the regular appearance of man-made objects. The feature achieves full affine invariance without needing to simulate over affine parameter space. Low-rank SIFT, as we name the feature, is based on our observation that local tilt, which are caused by changes of camera axis orientation, could be normalized by converting local patches to standard low-rank forms. Rotation, translation and scaling invariance could be achieved in ways similar to SIFT. As an extension of SIFT, our method seeks to add prior to solve the ill-posed affine parameter estimation problem and normalizes them directly, and is applicable to objects with regular structures. Furthermore, owing to recent breakthrough in convex optimization, such parameter could be computed efficiently. We will demonstrate its effectiveness in place recognition as our major application. As extra contributions, we also describe our pipeline of constructing geotagged building database from the ground up, as well as an efficient scheme for automatic feature selection.

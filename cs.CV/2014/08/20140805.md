- **Summary**: Person re-identification is becoming a hot research for developing both machine learning algorithms and video surveillance applications. The task of person re-identification is to determine which person in a gallery has the same identity to a probe image. This task basically assumes that the subject of the probe image belongs to the gallery, that is, the gallery contains this person. However, in practical applications such as searching a suspect in a video, this assumption is usually not true. In this paper, we consider the open-set person re-identification problem, which includes two sub-tasks, detection and identification. The detection sub-task is to determine the presence of the probe subject in the gallery, and the identification sub-task is to determine which person in the gallery has the same identity as the accepted probe. We present a database collected from a video surveillance setting of 6 cameras, with 200 persons and 7,413 images segmented. Based on this database, we develop a benchmark protocol for evaluating the performance under the open-set person re-identification scenario. Several popular metric learning algorithms for person re-identification have been evaluated as baselines. From the baseline performance, we observe that the open-set person re-identification problem is still largely unresolved, thus further attention and effort is needed.

- **Summary**: Self Organizing Map (SOM) has been applied into several classical modeling tasks including clustering, classification, function approximation and visualization of high dimensional spaces. The final products of a trained SOM are a set of ordered (low dimensional) indices and their associated high dimensional weight vectors. While in the above-mentioned applications, the final high dimensional weight vectors play the primary role in the computational steps, from a certain perspective, one can interpret SOM as a nonparametric encoder, in which the final low dimensional indices of the trained SOM are pointer to the high dimensional space. We showed how using a one-dimensional SOM, which is not common in usual applications of SOM, one can develop a nonparametric mapping from a high dimensional space to a continuous one-dimensional numerical field. These numerical values, called contextual numbers, are ordered in a way that in a given context, similar numbers refer to similar high dimensional states. Further, as these numbers can be treated similarly to usual continuous numbers, they can be replaced with their corresponding high dimensional states within any data driven modeling problem. As a potential application, we showed how using contextual numbers could be used for the problem of high dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics.

- **Summary**: We use a cluster ensemble to determine the number of clusters, k, in a group of data. A consensus similarity matrix is formed from the ensemble using multiple algorithms and several values for k. A random walk is induced on the graph defined by the consensus matrix and the eigenvalues of the associated transition probability matrix are used to determine the number of clusters. For noisy or high-dimensional data, an iterative technique is presented to refine this consensus matrix in way that encourages a block-diagonal form. It is shown that the resulting consensus matrix is generally superior to existing similarity matrices for this type of spectral analysis.

- **Summary**: A novel framework for consensus clustering is presented which has the ability to determine both the number of clusters and a final solution using multiple algorithms. A consensus similarity matrix is formed from an ensemble using multiple algorithms and several values for k. A variety of dimension reduction techniques and clustering algorithms are considered for analysis. For noisy or high-dimensional data, an iterative technique is presented to refine this consensus matrix in way that encourages algorithms to agree upon a common solution. We utilize the theory of nearly uncoupled Markov chains to determine the number, k , of clusters in a dataset by considering a random walk on the graph defined by the consensus matrix. The eigenvalues of the associated transition probability matrix are used to determine the number of clusters. This method succeeds at determining the number of clusters in many datasets where previous methods fail. On every considered dataset, our consensus method provides a final result with accuracy well above the average of the individual algorithms.

- **Summary**: Within the framework of a virtual clinical trial for breast imaging, we aim to develop numerical observers that follow the same detection performance trends as those of a typical human observer. In our prior work, we showed that by including spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity function (stCSF) of human visual system (HVS) in a multi-slice channelized Hotelling observer (msCHO), we can correctly predict trends of a typical human observer performance with the viewing parameters of browsing speed, viewing distance and contrast. In this work we further improve our numerical observer by modeling contrast masking. After stCSF, contrast masking is the second most prominent property of HVS and it refers to the fact that the presence of one signal affects the visibility threshold for another signal. Our results indicate that the improved numerical observer better predicts changes in detection performance with background complexity.

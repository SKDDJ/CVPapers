- **Summary**: Gabor filters can extract multi-orientation and multiscale features from face images. Researchers have designed different ways to use the magnitude of the filtered results for face recognition: Gabor Fisher classifier exploited only the magnitude information of Gabor magnitude pictures (GMPs); Local Gabor Binary Pattern uses only the gradient information. In this paper, we regard GMPs as smooth surfaces. By completely describing the shape of GMPs, we get a face representation method called Gabor Surface Feature (GSF). First, we compute the magnitude, 1st and 2nd derivatives of GMPs, then binarize them and transform them into decimal values. Finally we construct joint histograms and use subspace methods for classification. Experiments on FERET, ORL and FRGC 1.0.4 database show the effectiveness of GSF.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a dictionary learning based approach applied to the problem of real-time reconstruction of MR image sequences that are highly undersampled in k-space. Unlike traditional dictionary learning, our method integrates both global and patch-wise (local) sparsity information and incorporates some priori information into the reconstruction process. Moreover, we use a Dependent Hierarchical Beta-process as the prior for the group-based dictionary learning, which adaptively infers the dictionary size and the sparsity of each patch; and also ensures that similar patches are manifested in terms of similar dictionary atoms. An efficient numerical algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is also presented. Through extensive experimental results we show that our proposed method achieves superior reconstruction quality, compared to the other state-of-the- art DL-based methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a text line identification method is proposed. The text lines of printed document are easy to segment due to uniform straightness of the lines and sufficient gap between the lines. But in handwritten documents, the line is non-uniform and interline gaps are variable. We take Rabindranath Tagore's manuscript as it is one of the most difficult manuscripts that contain doodles. Our method consists of a pre-processing stage to clean the document image. Then we separate doodles from the manuscript to get the textual region. After that we identify the text lines on the manuscript. For text line identification, we use window examination, black run-length smearing, horizontal histogram and connected component analysis.

- **Summary**: We define a new class of binary matrices by maximizing the peak-sidelobe distances in the aperiodic autocorrelations. These matrices can be used as robust position marks for in-plane spatial alignment. The optimal square matrices of dimensions up to 7 by 7 and optimal diagonally-symmetric matrices of 8 by 8 and 9 by 9 were found by exhaustive searches.

- **Summary**: In a series of papers by Dai and colleagues [1,2], a feature map (or kernel) was introduced for semi- and unsupervised learning. This feature map is build from the output of an ensemble of classifiers trained without using the ground-truth class labels. In this critique, we analyze the latest version of this series of papers, which is called Ensemble Projections [2]. We show that the results reported in [2] were not well conducted, and that Ensemble Projections performs poorly for semi-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: Surface parameterizations have been widely used in computer graphics and geometry processing. In particular, as simply-connected open surfaces are conformally equivalent to the unit disk, it is desirable to compute the disk conformal parameterizations of the surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for the conformal parameterization of a simply-connected open surface onto the unit disk, which significantly speeds up the computation, enhances the conformality and stability, and guarantees the bijectivity. The conformality distortions at the inner region and on the boundary are corrected by two steps, with the aid of an iterative scheme using quasi-conformal theories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Historically, researchers in the field have spent a great deal of effort to create image representations that have scale invariance and retain spatial location information. This paper proposes to encode equivalent temporal characteristics in video representations for action recognition. To achieve temporal scale invariance, we develop a method called temporal scale pyramid (TSP). To encode temporal information, we present and compare two methods called temporal extension descriptor (TED) and temporal division pyramid (TDP) . Our purpose is to suggest solutions for matching complex actions that have large variation in velocity and appearance, which is missing from most current action representations. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets, UCF50, HMDB51, Hollywood2 and Olympic Sports, support our approach and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Most noticeably, we achieve 65.0% mean accuracy and 68.2% mean average precision on the challenging HMDB51 and Hollywood2 datasets which constitutes an absolute improvement over the state-of-the-art by 7.8% and 3.9%, respectively.

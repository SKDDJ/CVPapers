- **Summary**: Similarity search (nearest neighbor search) is a problem of pursuing the data items whose distances to a query item are the smallest from a large database. Various methods have been developed to address this problem, and recently a lot of efforts have been devoted to approximate search. In this paper, we present a survey on one of the main solutions, hashing, which has been widely studied since the pioneering work locality sensitive hashing. We divide the hashing algorithms two main categories: locality sensitive hashing, which designs hash functions without exploring the data distribution and learning to hash, which learns hash functions according the data distribution, and review them from various aspects, including hash function design and distance measure and search scheme in the hash coding space.

- **Summary**: The recent progress in sparse coding and deep learning has made unsupervised feature learning methods a strong competitor to hand-crafted descriptors. In computer vision, success stories of learned features have been predominantly reported for object recognition tasks. In this paper, we investigate if and how feature learning can be used for material recognition. We propose two strategies to incorporate scale information into the learning procedure resulting in a novel multi-scale coding procedure. Our results show that our learned features for material recognition outperform hand-crafted descriptors on the FMD and the KTH-TIPS2 material classification benchmarks.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach for contrast enhancement of spinal cord medical images based on multirate scheme incorporated into multiscale retinex algorithm. The proposed work here uses HSV color space, since HSV color space separates color details from intensity. The enhancement of medical image is achieved by down sampling the original image into five versions, namely, tiny, small, medium, fine, and normal scale. This is due to the fact that the each versions of the image when independently enhanced and reconstructed results in enormous improvement in the visual quality. Further, the contrast stretching and MultiScale Retinex (MSR) techniques are exploited in order to enhance each of the scaled version of the image. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by combining each of these scales in an efficient way to obtain the composite enhanced image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by using a wavelet energy metric in the wavelet domain. Reconstructed image using proposed method highlights the details (edges and tissues), reduces image noise (Gaussian and Speckle) and improves the overall contrast. The proposed algorithm also enhances sharp edges of the tissue surrounding the spinal cord regions which is useful for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions. Elaborated experiments are conducted on several medical images and results presented show that the enhanced medical pictures are of good quality and is found to be better compared with other researcher methods.

- **Summary**: Ill-posed inverse problems are commonplace in biomedical image processing. Their solution typically requires imposing prior knowledge about the latent ground truth. While this regularizes the problem to an extent where it can be solved, it also biases the result toward the expected. With inappropriate priors harming more than they use, it remains unclear what prior to use for a given practical problem. Priors are hence mostly chosen in an {\em ad hoc} or empirical fashion. We argue here that the gradient distribution of natural-scene images may provide a versatile and well-founded prior for biomedical images. We provide motivation for this choice from different points of view, and we fully validate the resulting prior for use on biomedical images by showing its stability and correlation with image quality. We then provide a set of simple parametric models for the resulting prior, leading to straightforward (quasi-)convex optimization problems for which we provide efficient solver algorithms. We illustrate the use of the present models and solvers in a variety of common image-processing tasks, including contrast enhancement, noise level estimation, denoising, blind deconvolution, zooming/up-sampling, and dehazing. In all cases we show that the present method leads to results that are comparable to or better than the state of the art; always using the same, simple prior. We conclude by discussing the limitations and possible interpretations of the prior.

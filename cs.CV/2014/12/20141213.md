- **Summary**: Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices have become popular to encode image information. Accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices has proven key to the success of many algorithms. However, most existing methods only approximate the true shape of the manifold locally by its tangent plane. In this paper, inspired by kernel methods, we propose to map SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To encode the geometry of the manifold in the mapping, we introduce a family of provably positive definite kernels on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. These kernels are derived from the Gaussian ker- nel, but exploit different metrics on the manifold. This lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM and kernel PCA, to the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the problems of pedestrian detection, ob- ject categorization, texture analysis, 2D motion segmentation and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) segmentation.

- **Summary**: We propose a framework for 2D shape analysis using positive definite kernels defined on Kendall's shape manifold. Different representations of 2D shapes are known to generate different nonlinear spaces. Due to the nonlinearity of these spaces, most existing shape classification algorithms resort to nearest neighbor methods and to learning distances on shape spaces. Here, we propose to map shapes on Kendall's shape manifold to a high dimensional Hilbert space where Euclidean geometry applies. To this end, we introduce a kernel on this manifold that permits such a mapping, and prove its positive definiteness. This kernel lets us extend kernel-based algorithms developed for Euclidean spaces, such as SVM, MKL and kernel PCA, to the shape manifold. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods on shape classification, clustering and retrieval.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of optimizing over all possible positive definite radial kernels on Riemannian manifolds for classification. Kernel methods on Riemannian manifolds have recently become increasingly popular in computer vision. However, the number of known positive definite kernels on manifolds remain very limited. Furthermore, most kernels typically depend on at least one parameter that needs to be tuned for the problem at hand. A poor choice of kernel, or of parameter value, may yield significant performance drop-off. Here, we show that positive definite radial kernels on the unit n-sphere, the Grassmann manifold and Kendall's shape manifold can be expressed in a simple form whose parameters can be automatically optimized within a support vector machine framework. We demonstrate the benefits of our kernel learning algorithm on object, face, action and shape recognition.

- **Summary**: We present a simple, efficient model for learning boundary detection based on a random forest classifier. Our approach combines (1) efficient clustering of training examples based on simple partitioning of the space of local edge orientations and (2) scale-dependent calibration of individual tree output probabilities prior to multiscale combination. The resulting model outperforms published results on the challenging BSDS500 boundary detection benchmark. Further, on large datasets our model requires substantially less memory for training and speeds up training time by a factor of 10 over the structured forest model.

- **Summary**: With the aim to improve the performance of feature matching, we present an unsupervised approach to fuse various local descriptors in the space of homographies. Inspired by the observation that the homographies of correct feature correspondences vary smoothly along the spatial domain, our approach stands on the unsupervised nature of feature matching, and can select a good descriptor for matching each feature point. Specifically, the homography space serves as the common domain, in which a correspondence obtained by any descriptor is considered as a point, for integrating various heterogeneous descriptors. Both geometric coherence and spatial continuity among correspondences are considered via computing their geodesic distances in the space. In this way, mutual verification across different descriptors is allowed, and correct correspondences will be highlighted with a high degree of consistency (i.e., short geodesic distances here). It follows that one-class SVM can be applied to identifying these correct correspondences, and boosts the performance of feature matching. The proposed approach is comprehensively compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, and evaluated on four benchmarks of image matching. The promising results manifest its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: In this contribution, a Bayes Ying Yang(BYY) harmony based approach for on-line signature verification is presented. In the proposed method, a simple but effective Gaussian Mixture Models(GMMs) is used to represent for each user's signature model based on the prior information collected. Different from the early works, in this paper, we use the Bayes Ying Yang machine combined with the harmony function to achieve Automatic Model Selection(AMS) during the parameter learning for the GMMs, so that a better approximation of the user model is assured. Experiments on a database from the First International Signature Verification Competition(SVC 2004) confirm that this combined algorithm yields quite satisfactory results.

- **Summary**: Variational methods in imaging are nowadays developing towards a quite universal and flexible tool, allowing for highly successful approaches on tasks like denoising, deblurring, inpainting, segmentation, super-resolution, disparity, and optical flow estimation. The overall structure of such approaches is of the form ${\cal D}(Ku) + \alpha {\cal R} (u) \rightarrow \min_u$ ; where the functional ${\cal D}$ is a data fidelity term also depending on some input data $f$ and measuring the deviation of $Ku$ from such and ${\cal R}$ is a regularization functional. Moreover $K$ is a (often linear) forward operator modeling the dependence of data on an underlying image, and $\alpha$ is a positive regularization parameter. While ${\cal D}$ is often smooth and (strictly) convex, the current practice almost exclusively uses nonsmooth regularization functionals. The majority of successful techniques is using nonsmooth and convex functionals like the total variation and generalizations thereof or $\ell_1$-norms of coefficients arising from scalar products with some frame system. The efficient solution of such variational problems in imaging demands for appropriate algorithms. Taking into account the specific structure as a sum of two very different terms to be minimized, splitting algorithms are a quite canonical choice. Consequently this field has revived the interest in techniques like operator splittings or augmented Lagrangians. Here we shall provide an overview of methods currently developed and recent results as well as some computational studies providing a comparison of different methods and also illustrating their success in applications.

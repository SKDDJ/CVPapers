- **Summary**: We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: We present a method for gesture detection and localisation based on multi-scale and multi-modal deep learning. Each visual modality captures spatial information at a particular spatial scale (such as motion of the upper body or a hand), and the whole system operates at three temporal scales. Key to our technique is a training strategy which exploits: i) careful initialization of individual modalities; and ii) gradual fusion involving random dropping of separate channels (dubbed ModDrop) for learning cross-modality correlations while preserving uniqueness of each modality-specific representation. We present experiments on the ChaLearn 2014 Looking at People Challenge gesture recognition track, in which we placed first out of 17 teams. Fusing multiple modalities at several spatial and temporal scales leads to a significant increase in recognition rates, allowing the model to compensate for errors of the individual classifiers as well as noise in the separate channels. Futhermore, the proposed ModDrop training technique ensures robustness of the classifier to missing signals in one or several channels to produce meaningful predictions from any number of available modalities. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed fusion scheme to modalities of arbitrary nature by experiments on the same dataset augmented with audio.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a high performance face recognition system based on local binary pattern (LBP) using the probability distribution functions (PDF) of pixels in different mutually independent color channels which are robust to frontal homogenous illumination and planer rotation is proposed. The illumination of faces is enhanced by using the state-of-the-art technique which is using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and singular value decomposition (SVD). After equalization, face images are segmented by use of local Successive Mean Quantization Transform (SMQT) followed by skin color based face detection system. Kullback-Leibler Distance (KLD) between the concatenated PDFs of a given face obtained by LBP and the concatenated PDFs of each face in the database is used as a metric in the recognition process. Various decision fusion techniques have been used in order to improve the recognition rate. The proposed system has been tested on the FERET, HP, and Bosphorus face databases. The proposed system is compared with conventional and thestate-of-the-art techniques. The recognition rates obtained using FVF approach for FERET database is 99.78% compared with 79.60% and 68.80% for conventional gray scale LBP and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based face recognition techniques respectively.

- **Summary**: In this paper an equalization technique for colour images is introduced. The method is based on nth root and nth power equalization approach but with optimization of the mean of the image in different colour channels such as RGB and HSI. The performance of the proposed method has been measured by the means of peak signal to noise ratio. The proposed algorithm has been compared with conventional histogram equalization and the visual and quantitative experimental results are showing that the proposed method over perform the histogram equalization.

- **Summary**: This work proposes to obtain novel fractal descriptors from gray-level texture images by combining information from interior and boundary measures of the Minkowski dilation applied to the texture surface. At first, the image is converted into a surface where the height of each point is the gray intensity of the respective pixel in that position in the image. Thus, this surface is morphologically dilated by spheres. The radius of such spheres is ranged within an interval and the volume and the external area of the dilated structure are computed for each radius. The final descriptors are given by such measures concatenated and subject to a canonical transform to reduce the dimensionality. The proposal is an enhancement to the classical Bouligand-Minkowski fractal descriptors, where only the volume (interior) information is considered. As different structures may have the same volume, but not the same area, the proposal yields to more rich descriptors as confirmed by results on the classification of benchmark databases.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of reproducing the world lighting from a single image of an object covered with random specular microfacets on the surface. We show that such reflectors can be interpreted as a randomized mapping from the lighting to the image. Such specular objects have very different optical properties from both diffuse surfaces and smooth specular objects like metals, so we design special imaging system to robustly and effectively photograph them. We present simple yet reliable algorithms to calibrate the proposed system and do the inference. We conduct experiments to verify the correctness of our model assumptions and prove the effectiveness of our pipeline.

- **Summary**: In this paper, the problem of classifying synthetic and natural texture images is addressed. To tackle this problem, an innovative method is proposed that combines concepts from corrosion modeling and cellular automata to generate a texture descriptor. The core processes of metal (pitting) corrosion are identified and applied to texture images by incorporating the basic mechanisms of corrosion in the transition function of the cellular automaton. The surface morphology of the image is analyzed before and during the application of the transition function of the cellular automaton. In each iteration the cumulative mass of corroded product is obtained to construct each of the attributes of the texture descriptor. In a final step, this texture descriptor is used for image classification by applying Linear Discriminant Analysis. The method was tested on the well-known Brodatz and Vistex databases. In addition, in order to verify the robustness of the method, its invariance to noise and rotation were tested. To that end, different variants of the original two databases were obtained through addition of noise to and rotation of the images. The results showed that the method is effective for texture classification according to the high success rates obtained in all cases. This indicates the potential of employing methods inspired on natural phenomena in other fields.

We use CDFs to improve the accuracy of classification and at the same time control computational expense by tackling the curse of dimensionality.

- **Summary**: Object detection is an important research area in the field of computer vision. Many detection algorithms have been proposed. However, each object detector relies on specific assumptions of the object appearance and imaging conditions. As a consequence, no algorithm can be considered as universal. With the large variety of object detectors, the subsequent question is how to select and combine them.   In this paper, we propose a framework to learn how to combine object detectors. The proposed method uses (single) detectors like DPM, CN and EES, and exploits their correlation by high level contextual features to yield a combined detection list.   Experiments on the PASCAL VOC07 and VOC10 datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms single object detectors, DPM (8.4%), CN (6.8%) and EES (17.0%) on VOC07 and DPM (6.5%), CN (5.5%) and EES (16.2%) on VOC10.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a texture descriptor based on fractal theory. The method is based on the Bouligand-Minkowski descriptors. We decompose the original image recursively into 4 equal parts. In each recursion step, we estimate the average and the deviation of the Bouligand-Minkowski descriptors computed over each part. Thus, we extract entropy features from both average and deviation. The proposed descriptors are provided by the concatenation of such measures. The method is tested in a classification experiment under well known datasets, that is, Brodatz and Vistex. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves better results than classical and state-of-the-art texture descriptors, such as Gabor-wavelets and co-occurrence matrix.

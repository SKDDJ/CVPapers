- **Summary**: While previous researches in eye fixation prediction typically rely on integrating low-level features (e.g. color, edge) to form a saliency map, recently it has been found that the structural organization of these features into a proto-object representation can play a more significant role. In this work, we present a computational framework based on deep network to demonstrate that proto-object representations can be learned from low-resolution image patches from fixation regions. We advocate the use of low-resolution inputs in this work due to the following reasons: (1) Proto-objects are computed in parallel over an entire visual field (2) People can perceive or recognize objects well even it is in low resolution. (3) Fixations from lower resolution images can predict fixations on higher resolution images. In the proposed computational model, we extract multi-scale image patches on fixation regions from eye fixation datasets, resize them to low resolution and feed them into a hierarchical. With layer-wise unsupervised feature learning, we find that many proto-objects like features responsive to different shapes of object blobs are learned out. Visualizations also show that these features are selective to potential objects in the scene and the responses of these features work well in predicting eye fixations on the images when combined with learned weights.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning feature representation from unlabeled data using a single-layer K-means network. A K-means network maps the input data into a feature representation by finding the nearest centroid for each input point, which has attracted researchers' great attention recently due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and scalability. However, one drawback of this feature mapping is that it tends to be unreliable when the training data contains noise. To address this issue, we propose a SVDD based feature learning algorithm that describes the density and distribution of each cluster from K-means with an SVDD ball for more robust feature representation. For this purpose, we present a new SVDD algorithm called C-SVDD that centers the SVDD ball towards the mode of local density of each cluster, and we show that the objective of C-SVDD can be solved very efficiently as a linear programming problem. Additionally, traditional unsupervised feature learning methods usually take an average or sum of local representations to obtain global representation which ignore spatial relationship among them. To use spatial information we propose a global representation with a variant of SIFT descriptor. The architecture is also extended with multiple receptive field scales and multiple pooling sizes. Extensive experiments on several popular object recognition benchmarks, such as STL-10, MINST, Holiday and Copydays shows that the proposed C-SVDDNet method yields comparable or better performance than that of the previous state of the art methods.

- **Summary**: The economic and production losses in agricultural industry worldwide are due to the presence of diseases in the several kinds of fruits. In this paper, a method for the classification of fruit diseases is proposed and experimentally validated. The image processing based proposed approach is composed of the following main steps; in the first step K-Means clustering technique is used for the defect segmentation, in the second step color and textural cues are extracted and fused from the segmented image, and finally images are classified into one of the classes by using a Multi-class Support Vector Machine. We have considered diseases of apple as a test case and evaluated our approach for three types of apple diseases namely apple scab, apple blotch and apple rot and normal apples without diseases. Our experimentation points out that the proposed fusion scheme can significantly support accurate detection and automatic classification of fruit diseases.

- **Summary**: The facial expression recognition is an ocular task that can be performed without human discomfort, is really a speedily growing on the computer research field. There are many applications and programs uses facial expression to evaluate human character, judgment, feelings, and viewpoint. The process of recognizing facial expression is a hard task due to the several circumstances such as facial occlusions, face shape, illumination, face colors, and etc. This paper present a PCA methodology to distinguish expressions of faces under different circumstances and identifying it. Relies on Eigen faces technique using standard Data base images. So as to overcome the problem of difficulty to computers to identify the features and expressions of persons.

- **Summary**: We discretize a cost functional for image registration problems by deriving Taylor expansions for the matching term. Minima of the discretized cost functionals can be computed with no spatial discretization error, and the optimal solutions are equivalent to minimal energy curves in the space of $k$-jets. We show that the solutions convergence to optimal solutions of the original cost functional as the number of particles increases with a convergence rate of $O(h^{d+k})$ where $h$ is a resolution parameter. The effect of this approach over traditional particle methods is illustrated on synthetic examples and real images.

- **Summary**: We survey the role of symmetry in diffeomorphic registration of landmarks, curves, surfaces, images and higher-order data. The infinite dimensional problem of finding correspondences between objects can for a range of concrete data types be reduced resulting in compact representations of shape and spatial structure. This reduction is possible because the available data is incomplete in encoding the full deformation model. Using reduction by symmetry, we describe the reduced models in a common theoretical framework that draws on links between the registration problem and geometric mechanics. Symmetry also arises in reduction to the Lie algebra using particle relabeling symmetry allowing the equations of motion to be written purely in terms of Eulerian velocity field. Reduction by symmetry has recently been applied for jet-matching and higher-order discrete approximations of the image matching problem. We outline these constructions and further cases where reduction by symmetry promises new approaches to registration of complex data types.

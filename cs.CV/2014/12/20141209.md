- **Summary**: This paper deals with the multiple annotation problem in medical application of cancer detection in digital images. The main assumption is that though images are labeled by many experts, the number of images read by the same expert is not large. Thus differing with the existing work on modeling each expert and ground truth simultaneously, the multi annotation information is used in a soft manner. The multiple labels from different experts are used to estimate the probability of the findings to be marked as malignant. The learning algorithm minimizes the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between the modeled probabilities and desired ones constraining the model to be compact. The probabilities are modeled by logit regression and multiple instance learning concept is used by us.   Experiments on a real-life computer aided diagnosis (CAD) problem for CXR CAD lung cancer detection demonstrate that the proposed algorithm leads to similar results as learning with a binary RVMMIL classifier or a mixture of binary RVMMIL models per annotator. However, this model achieves a smaller complexity and is more preferable in practice.

- **Summary**: Advances in computing technology have allowed researchers across many fields of endeavor to collect and maintain vast amounts of observational statistical data such as clinical data,biological patient data,data regarding access of web sites,financial data,and the like.Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI)segmentation is a complex problem in the field of medical imaging despite various presented methods.MR image of human brain can be divided into several sub regions especially soft tissues such as gray matter,white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.Although edge information is the main clue in image segmentation,it can not get a better result in analysis the content of images without combining other information.The segmentation of brain tissue in the magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)is very important for detecting the existence and outlines of tumors.In this paper,an algorithm about segmentation based on the symmetry character of brain MRI image is presented.Our goal is to detect the position and boundary of tumors automatically.Experiments were conducted on real pictures,and the results show that the algorithm is flexible and convenient.

- **Summary**: We present an accurate, real-time approach to robotic grasp detection based on convolutional neural networks. Our network performs single-stage regression to graspable bounding boxes without using standard sliding window or region proposal techniques. The model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 14 percentage points and runs at 13 frames per second on a GPU. Our network can simultaneously perform classification so that in a single step it recognizes the object and finds a good grasp rectangle. A modification to this model predicts multiple grasps per object by using a locally constrained prediction mechanism. The locally constrained model performs significantly better, especially on objects that can be grasped in a variety of ways.

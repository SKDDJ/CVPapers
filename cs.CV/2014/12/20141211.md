- **Summary**: Detecting traversable road areas ahead a moving vehicle is a key process for modern autonomous driving systems. A common approach to road detection consists of exploiting color features to classify pixels as road or background. These algorithms reduce the effect of lighting variations and weather conditions by exploiting the discriminant/invariant properties of different color representations. Furthermore, the lack of labeled datasets has motivated the development of algorithms performing on single images based on the assumption that the bottom part of the image belongs to the road surface.   In this paper, we first introduce a dataset of road images taken at different times and in different scenarios using an onboard camera. Then, we devise a simple online algorithm and conduct an exhaustive evaluation of different classifiers and the effect of using different color representation to characterize pixels.

- **Summary**: While egocentric cameras like GoPro are gaining popularity, the videos they capture are long, boring, and difficult to watch from start to end. Fast forwarding (i.e. frame sampling) is a natural choice for faster video browsing. However, this accentuates the shake caused by natural head motion, making the fast forwarded video useless.   We propose EgoSampling, an adaptive frame sampling that gives more stable fast forwarded videos. Adaptive frame sampling is formulated as energy minimization, whose optimal solution can be found in polynomial time.   In addition, egocentric video taken while walking suffers from the left-right movement of the head as the body weight shifts from one leg to another. We turn this drawback into a feature: Stereo video can be created by sampling the frames from the left most and right most head positions of each step, forming approximate stereo-pairs.

- **Summary**: In many applications, such as development and testing of image processing algorithms, it is often necessary to simulate images containing realistic noise from solid-state photosensors. A high-level model of CCD and CMOS photosensors based on a literature review is formulated in this paper. The model includes photo-response non-uniformity, photon shot noise, dark current Fixed Pattern Noise, dark current shot noise, offset Fixed Pattern Noise, source follower noise, sense node reset noise, and quantisation noise. The model also includes voltage-to-voltage, voltage-to-electrons, and analogue-to-digital converter non-linearities. The formulated model can be used to create synthetic images for testing and validation of image processing algorithms in the presence of realistic images noise. An example of the simulated CMOS photosensor and a comparison with a custom-made CMOS hardware sensor is presented. Procedures for characterisation from both light and dark noises are described. Experimental results that confirm the validity of the numerical model are provided. The paper addresses the issue of the lack of comprehensive high-level photosensor models that enable engineers to simulate realistic effects of noise on the images obtained from solid-state photosensors.

- **Summary**: In this paper a novel possibilistic c-means clustering algorithm, called Adaptive Possibilistic c-means, is presented. Its main feature is that {\it all} its parameters, after their initialization, are properly adapted during its execution. Provided that the algorithm starts with a reasonable overestimate of the number of physical clusters formed by the data, it is capable, in principle, to unravel them (a long-standing issue in the clustering literature). This is due to the fully adaptive nature of the proposed algorithm that enables the removal of the clusters that gradually become obsolete. In addition, the adaptation of all its parameters increases the flexibility of the algorithm in following the variations in the formation of the clusters that occur from iteration to iteration. Theoretical results that are indicative of the convergence behavior of the algorithm are also provided. Finally, extensive simulation results on both synthetic and real data highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: Learning compact and interpretable representations is a very natural task, which has not been solved satisfactorily even for simple binary datasets. In this paper, we review various ways of composing experts for binary data and argue that competitive forms of interaction are best suited to learn low-dimensional representations. We propose a new composition rule that discourages experts from focusing on similar structures and that penalizes opposing votes strongly so that abstaining from voting becomes more attractive. We also introduce a novel sequential initialization procedure, which is based on a process of oversimplification and correction. Experiments show that with our approach very intuitive models can be learned.

- **Summary**: Object class detectors typically apply a window classifier to all the windows in a large set, either in a sliding window manner or using object proposals. In this paper, we develop an active search strategy that sequentially chooses the next window to evaluate based on all the information gathered before. This results in a substantial reduction in the number of classifier evaluations and in a more elegant approach in general. Our search strategy is guided by two forces. First, we exploit context as the statistical relation between the appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in the training set. This enables to jump across distant regions in the image (e.g. observing a sky region suggests that cars might be far below) and is done efficiently in a Random Forest framework. Second, we exploit the score of the classifier to attract the search to promising areas surrounding a highly scored window, and to keep away from areas near low scored ones. Our search strategy can be applied on top of any classifier as it treats it as a black-box. In experiments with R-CNN on the challenging SUN2012 dataset, our method matches the detection accuracy of evaluating all windows independently, while evaluating 9x fewer windows.

- **Summary**: Recent work has shown deep neural networks (DNNs) to be highly susceptible to well-designed, small perturbations at the input layer, or so-called adversarial examples. Taking images as an example, such distortions are often imperceptible, but can result in 100% mis-classification for a state of the art DNN. We study the structure of adversarial examples and explore network topology, pre-processing and training strategies to improve the robustness of DNNs. We perform various experiments to assess the removability of adversarial examples by corrupting with additional noise and pre-processing with denoising autoencoders (DAEs). We find that DAEs can remove substantial amounts of the adversarial noise. How- ever, when stacking the DAE with the original DNN, the resulting network can again be attacked by new adversarial examples with even smaller distortion. As a solution, we propose Deep Contractive Network, a model with a new end-to-end training procedure that includes a smoothness penalty inspired by the contractive autoencoder (CAE). This increases the network robustness to adversarial examples, without a significant performance penalty.

- **Summary**: Human Motion Analysis (HMA) is currently one of the most popularly active research domains as such significant research interests are motivated by a number of real world applications such as video surveillance, sports analysis, healthcare monitoring and so on. However, most of these real world applications face high levels of uncertainties that can affect the operations of such applications. Hence, the fuzzy set theory has been applied and showed great success in the recent past. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the fuzzy set oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the current literature that has discussed and reviewed fuzzy approaches towards the HMA. For ease of understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA.

  behavior discovery and spatial alignment of articulated object classes from
  unstructured video (available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09319)
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Given unstructured videos of deformable objects, we automatically recover spatiotemporal correspondences to map one object to another (such as animals in the wild). While traditional methods based on appearance fail in such challenging conditions, we exploit consistency in object motion between instances. Our approach discovers pairs of short video intervals where the object moves in a consistent manner and uses these candidates as seeds for spatial alignment. We model the spatial correspondence between the point trajectories on the object in one interval to those in the other using a time-varying Thin Plate Spline deformation model. On a large dataset of tiger and horse videos, our method automatically aligns thousands of pairs of frames to a high accuracy, and outperforms the popular SIFT Flow algorithm.

- **Summary**: In single particle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the 3D structure of a molecule needs to be determined from its 2D projection images taken at unknown viewing directions. Zvi Kam showed already in 1980 that the autocorrelation function of the 3D molecule over the rotation group SO(3) can be estimated from 2D projection images whose viewing directions are uniformly distributed over the sphere. The autocorrelation function determines the expansion coefficients of the 3D molecule in spherical harmonics up to an orthogonal matrix of size $(2l+1)\times (2l+1)$ for each $l=0,1,2,...$. In this paper we show how techniques for solving the phase retrieval problem in X-ray crystallography can be modified for the cryo-EM setup for retrieving the missing orthogonal matrices. Specifically, we present two new approaches that we term Orthogonal Extension and Orthogonal Replacement, in which the main algorithmic components are the singular value decomposition and semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the utility of these approaches through numerical experiments on simulated data.

- **Summary**: This paper offers a characterization of fundamental limits on the classification and reconstruction of high-dimensional signals from low-dimensional features, in the presence of side information. We consider a scenario where a decoder has access both to linear features of the signal of interest and to linear features of the side information signal; while the side information may be in a compressed form, the objective is recovery or classification of the primary signal, not the side information. The signal of interest and the side information are each assumed to have (distinct) latent discrete labels; conditioned on these two labels, the signal of interest and side information are drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. With joint probabilities on the latent labels, the overall signal-(side information) representation is defined by a Gaussian mixture model. We then provide sharp sufficient and/or necessary conditions for these quantities to approach zero when the covariance matrices of the Gaussians are nearly low-rank. These conditions, which are reminiscent of the well-known Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv conditions, are a function of the number of linear features extracted from the signal of interest, the number of linear features extracted from the side information signal, and the geometry of these signals and their interplay. Moreover, on assuming that the signal of interest and the side information obey such an approximately low-rank model, we derive expansions of the reconstruction error as a function of the deviation from an exactly low-rank model; such expansions also allow identification of operational regimes where the impact of side information on signal reconstruction is most relevant. Our framework, which offers a principled mechanism to integrate side information in high-dimensional data problems, is also tested in the context of imaging applications.

- **Summary**: Recognizing materials in real-world images is a challenging task. Real-world materials have rich surface texture, geometry, lighting conditions, and clutter, which combine to make the problem particularly difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new, large-scale, open dataset of materials in the wild, the Materials in Context Database (MINC), and combine this dataset with deep learning to achieve material recognition and segmentation of images in the wild.   MINC is an order of magnitude larger than previous material databases, while being more diverse and well-sampled across its 23 categories. Using MINC, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for two tasks: classifying materials from patches, and simultaneous material recognition and segmentation in full images. For patch-based classification on MINC we found that the best performing CNN architectures can achieve 85.2% mean class accuracy. We convert these trained CNN classifiers into an efficient fully convolutional framework combined with a fully connected conditional random field (CRF) to predict the material at every pixel in an image, achieving 73.1% mean class accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that having a large, well-sampled dataset such as MINC is crucial for real-world material recognition and segmentation.

- **Summary**: Sparse approximations using highly over-complete dictionaries is a state-of-the-art tool for many imaging applications including denoising, super-resolution, compressive sensing, light-field analysis, and object recognition. Unfortunately, the applicability of such methods is severely hampered by the computational burden of sparse approximation: these algorithms are linear or super-linear in both the data dimensionality and size of the dictionary. We propose a framework for learning the hierarchical structure of over-complete dictionaries that enables fast computation of sparse representations. Our method builds on tree-based strategies for nearest neighbor matching, and presents domain-specific enhancements that are highly efficient for the analysis of image patches. Contrary to most popular methods for building spatial data structures, out methods rely on shallow, balanced trees with relatively few layers. We show an extensive array of experiments on several applications such as image denoising/superresolution, compressive video/light-field sensing where we practically achieve 100-1000x speedup (with a less than 1dB loss in accuracy).

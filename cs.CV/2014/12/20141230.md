- **Summary**: We introduce a simple modification of local image descriptors, such as SIFT, based on pooling gradient orientations across different domain sizes, in addition to spatial locations. The resulting descriptor, which we call DSP-SIFT, outperforms other methods in wide-baseline matching benchmarks, including those based on convolutional neural networks, despite having the same dimension of SIFT and requiring no training.

- **Summary**: The input numerical aperture (NA) of multimode fiber (MMF) can be effectively increased by placing turbid media at the input end of the MMF. This provides the potential for high-resolution imaging through the MMF. While the input NA is increased, the number of propagation modes in the MMF and hence the output NA remains the same. This makes the image reconstruction process underdetermined and may limit the quality of the image reconstruction. In this paper, we aim to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the image reconstruction in imaging through MMF. We notice that turbid media placed in the input of the MMF transforms the incoming waves into a better format for information transmission and information extraction. We call this transformation as holistic random (HR) encoding of turbid media. By exploiting the HR encoding, we make a considerable improvement on the SNR of the image reconstruction. For efficient utilization of the HR encoding, we employ sparse representation (SR), a relatively new signal reconstruction framework when it is provided with a HR encoded signal. This study shows for the first time to our knowledge the benefit of utilizing the HR encoding of turbid media for recovery in the optically underdetermined systems where the output NA of it is smaller than the input NA for imaging through MMF.

- **Summary**: The main contribution of this paper is to propose an iterative procedure for tubular structure segmentation of 2D images, which combines tight frame of Curvelet transforms with a SURE technique thresholding which is based on principle obtained by minimizing Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate for denoising. This proposed algorithm is mainly based on the TFA proposal presented in [1, 9], which we use eigenvectors of Hessian matrix of image for improving this iterative part in segmenting unclear and narrow vessels and filling the gap between separate pieces of detected vessels. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

- **Summary**: Dictionary learning algorithms or supervised deep convolution networks have considerably improved the efficiency of predefined feature representations such as SIFT. We introduce a deep scattering convolution network, with predefined wavelet filters over spatial and angular variables. This representation brings an important improvement to results previously obtained with predefined features over object image databases such as Caltech and CIFAR. The resulting accuracy is comparable to results obtained with unsupervised deep learning and dictionary based representations. This shows that refining image representations by using geometric priors is a promising direction to improve image classification and its understanding.

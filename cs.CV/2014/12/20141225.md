- **Summary**: Texture plays an important role in computer vision. It is one of the most important visual attributes used in image analysis, once it provides information about pixel organization at different regions of the image. This paper presents a novel approach for texture characterization, based on complexity analysis. The proposed approach expands the idea of the Mass-radius fractal dimension, a method originally developed for shape analysis, to a set of coordinates in 3D-space that represents the texture under analysis in a signature able to characterize efficiently different texture classes in terms of complexity. An experiment using images from the Brodatz album illustrates the method performance.

- **Summary**: The use of a rapid and accurate method in diagnosis and classification of species and/or cultivars of forage has practical relevance, scientific and trade in various areas of study. Thus, leaf samples of fodder plant species \textit{Brachiaria} were previously identified, collected and scanned to be treated by means of artificial vision to make the database and be used in subsequent classifications. Forage crops used were: \textit{Brachiaria decumbens} cv. IPEAN; \textit{Brachiaria ruziziensis} Germain \& Evrard; \textit{Brachiaria Brizantha} (Hochst. ex. A. Rich.) Stapf; \textit{Brachiaria arrecta} (Hack.) Stent. and \textit{Brachiaria spp}. The images were analyzed by the fractal descriptors method, where a set of measures are obtained from the values of the fractal dimension at different scales. Therefore such values are used as inputs for a state-of-the-art classifier, the Support Vector Machine, which finally discriminates the images according to the respective species.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel technique for obtaining descriptors of gray-level texture images. The descriptors are provided by applying a multiscale transform to the fractal dimension of the image estimated through the probability (Voss) method. The effectiveness of the descriptors is verified in a classification task using benchmark over texture datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method as a tool for the description and discrimination of texture images.

- **Summary**: Traditional object recognition approaches apply feature extraction, part deformation handling, occlusion handling and classification sequentially while they are independent from each other. Ouyang and Wang proposed a model for jointly learning of all of the mentioned processes using one deep neural network. We utilized, and manipulated their toolbox in order to apply it in car detection scenarios where it had not been tested. Creating a single deep architecture from these components, improves the interaction between them and can enhance the performance of the whole system. We believe that the approach can be used as a general purpose object detection toolbox. We tested the algorithm on UIUC car dataset, and achieved an outstanding result. The accuracy of our method was 97 % while the previously reported results showed an accuracy of up to 91 %. We strongly believe that having an experiment on a larger dataset can show the advantage of using deep models over shallow ones.

- **Summary**: Texture analysis and classification remain as one of the biggest challenges for the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. On this matter, Gabor wavelets has proven to be a useful technique to characterize distinctive texture patterns. However, most of the approaches used to extract descriptors of the Gabor magnitude space usually fail in representing adequately the richness of detail present into a unique feature vector. In this paper, we propose a new method to enhance the Gabor wavelets process extracting a fractal signature of the magnitude spaces. Each signature is reduced using a canonical analysis function and concatenated to form the final feature vector. Experiments were conducted on several texture image databases to prove the power and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results obtained shown that this method outperforms other early proposed method, creating a more reliable technique for texture feature extraction.

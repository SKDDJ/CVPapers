- **Summary**: Image registration is a challenging task in the world of medical imaging. Particularly, accurate edge registration plays a central role in a variety of clinical conditions. The Modality Independent Neighbourhood Descriptor (MIND) demonstrates state of the art alignment, based on the image self-similarity. However, this method appears to be less accurate regarding edge registration. In this work, we propose a new registration method, incorporating gradient intensity and MIND self-similarity metric. Experimental results show the superiority of this method in edge registration tasks, while preserving the original MIND performance for other image features and textures.

- **Summary**: Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g. multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g. resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain.

- **Summary**: Functional Magnetic Resonance Images acquired during resting-state provide information about the functional organization of the brain through measuring correlations between brain areas. Independent components analysis is the reference approach to estimate spatial components from weakly structured data such as brain signal time courses; each of these components may be referred to as a brain network and the whole set of components can be conceptualized as a brain functional atlas. Recently, new methods using a sparsity prior have emerged to deal with low signal-to-noise ratio data. However, even when using sophisticated priors, the results may not be very sparse and most often do not separate the spatial components into brain regions. This work presents post-processing techniques that automatically sparsify brain maps and separate regions properly using geometric operations, and compares these techniques according to faithfulness to data and stability metrics. In particular, among threshold-based approaches, hysteresis thresholding and random walker segmentation, the latter improves significantly the stability of both dense and sparse models.

- **Summary**: We describe CITlab's recognition system for the HTRtS competition attached to the 14. International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition, ICFHR 2014. The task comprises the recognition of historical handwritten documents. The core algorithms of our system are based on multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNN) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). The software modules behind that as well as the basic utility technologies are essentially powered by PLANET's ARGUS framework for intelligent text recognition and image processing.

- **Summary**: In this paper, an automatic seeded region growing algorithm is proposed for cellular image segmentation. First, the regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from the preprocessed image. Second, the initial seeds are automatically selected based on ROIs extracted from the image. Third, the most reprehensive seeds are selected using a machine learning algorithm. Finally, the cellular image is segmented into regions where each region corresponds to a seed. The aim of the proposed is to automatically extract the Region of Interests (ROI) from the cellular images in terms of overcoming the explosion, under segmentation and over segmentation problems. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the segmented image and the segmented results are less noisy as compared to some existing algorithms.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present GASG21 (Grassmannian Adaptive Stochastic Gradient for $L_{2,1}$ norm minimization), an adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm to robustly recover the low-rank subspace from a large matrix. In the presence of column outliers, we reformulate the batch mode matrix $L_{2,1}$ norm minimization with rank constraint problem as a stochastic optimization approach constrained on Grassmann manifold. For each observed data vector, the low-rank subspace $\mathcal{S}$ is updated by taking a gradient step along the geodesic of Grassmannian. In order to accelerate the convergence rate of the stochastic gradient method, we choose to adaptively tune the constant step-size by leveraging the consecutive gradients. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with proper initialization, the K-subspaces extension, K-GASG21, can robustly cluster a large number of corrupted data vectors into a union of subspaces. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithms even with heavy column outliers corruption.



### Representing Data by a Mixture of Activated Simplices

- **Summary**: We present a new model which represents data as a mixture of simplices. Simplices are geometric structures that generalize triangles. We give a simple geometric understanding that allows us to learn a simplicial structure efficiently. Our method requires that the data are unit normalized (and thus lie on the unit sphere). We show that under this restriction, building a model with simplices amounts to constructing a convex hull inside the sphere whose boundary facets is close to the data. We call the boundary facets of the convex hull that are close to the data Activated Simplices. While the total number of bases used to build the simplices is a parameter of the model, the dimensions of the individual activated simplices are learned from the data. Simplices can have different dimensions, which facilitates modeling of inhomogeneous data sources. The simplicial structure is bounded --- this is appropriate for modeling data with constraints, such as human elbows can not bend more than 180 degrees. The simplices are easy to interpret and extremes within the data can be discovered among the vertices. The method provides good reconstruction and regularization. It supports good nearest neighbor classification and it allows realistic generative models to be constructed. It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, including 3D poses and digits.

- **Summary**: Correlation filters take advantage of specific properties in the Fourier domain allowing them to be estimated efficiently: O(NDlogD) in the frequency domain, versus O(D^3 + ND^2) spatially where D is signal length, and N is the number of signals. Recent extensions to correlation filters, such as MOSSE, have reignited interest of their use in the vision community due to their robustness and attractive computational properties. In this paper we demonstrate, however, that this computational efficiency comes at a cost. Specifically, we demonstrate that only 1/D proportion of shifted examples are unaffected by boundary effects which has a dramatic effect on detection/tracking performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to correlation filter estimation that: (i) takes advantage of inherent computational redundancies in the frequency domain, and (ii) dramatically reduces boundary effects. Impressive object tracking and detection results are presented in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Feature-based object matching is a fundamental problem for many applications in computer vision, such as object recognition, 3D reconstruction, tracking, and motion segmentation. In this work, we consider simultaneously matching object instances in a set of images, where both inlier and outlier features are extracted. The task is to identify the inlier features and establish their consistent correspondences across the image set. This is a challenging combinatorial problem, and the problem complexity grows exponentially with the image number. To this end, we propose a novel framework, termed ROML, to address this problem. ROML optimizes simultaneously a partial permutation matrix (PPM) for each image, and feature correspondences are established by the obtained PPMs. Two of our key contributions are summarized as follows. (1) We formulate the problem as rank and sparsity minimization for PPM optimization, and treat simultaneous optimization of multiple PPMs as a regularized consensus problem in the context of distributed optimization. (2) We use the ADMM method to solve the thus formulated ROML problem, in which a subproblem associated with a single PPM optimization appears to be a difficult integer quadratic program (IQP). We prove that under wildly applicable conditions, this IQP is equivalent to a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), which can be efficiently solved to an exact solution. Extensive experiments on rigid/non-rigid object matching, matching instances of a common object category, and common object localization show the efficacy of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: With the introduction of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), resulting in a significant increase in acquisition speed, the fast and accurate segmentation of 3-D OCT scans has become evermore important. This paper presents a novel probabilistic approach, that models the appearance of retinal layers as well as the global shape variations of layer boundaries. Given an OCT scan, the full posterior distribution over segmentations is approximately inferred using a variational method enabling efficient probabilistic inference in terms of computationally tractable model components: Segmenting a full 3-D volume takes around a minute. Accurate segmentations demonstrate the benefit of using global shape regularization: We segmented 35 fovea-centered 3-D volumes with an average unsigned error of 2.46 $\pm$ 0.22 {\mu}m as well as 80 normal and 66 glaucomatous 2-D circular scans with errors of 2.92 $\pm$ 0.53 {\mu}m and 4.09 $\pm$ 0.98 {\mu}m respectively. Furthermore, we utilized the inferred posterior distribution to rate the quality of the segmentation, point out potentially erroneous regions and discriminate normal from pathological scans. No pre- or postprocessing was required and we used the same set of parameters for all data sets, underlining the robustness and out-of-the-box nature of our approach.

- **Summary**: Successful applications of sparse models in computer vision and machine learning imply that in many real-world applications, high dimensional data is distributed in a union of low dimensional subspaces. Nevertheless, the underlying structure may be affected by sparse errors and/or outliers. In this paper, we propose a bi-sparse model as a framework to analyze this problem and provide a novel algorithm to recover the union of subspaces in presence of sparse corruptions. We further show the effectiveness of our method by experiments on both synthetic data and real-world vision data.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSIs) are characterized by having a low spatial resolution and a high spectral resolution, whereas multispectral images (MSIs) are characterized by low spectral and high spatial resolutions. These complementary characteristics have stimulated active research in the inference of images with high spatial and spectral resolutions from HSI-MSI pairs.   In this paper, we formulate this data fusion problem as the minimization of a convex objective function containing two data-fitting terms and an edge-preserving regularizer. The data-fitting terms are quadratic and account for blur, different spatial resolutions, and additive noise; the regularizer, a form of vector Total Variation, promotes aligned discontinuities across the reconstructed hyperspectral bands.   The optimization described above is rather hard, owing to its non-diagonalizable linear operators, to the non-quadratic and non-smooth nature of the regularizer, and to the very large size of the image to be inferred. We tackle these difficulties by tailoring the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage Algorithm (SALSA)---an instance of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)---to this optimization problem. By using a convenient variable splitting and by exploiting the fact that HSIs generally "live" in a low-dimensional subspace, we obtain an effective algorithm that yields state-of-the-art results, as illustrated by experiments.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a weakly supervised sparse learning approach to the problem of noisily tagged image parsing, or segmenting all the objects within a noisily tagged image and identifying their categories (i.e. tags). Different from the traditional image parsing that takes pixel-level labels as strong supervisory information, our noisily tagged image parsing is provided with noisy tags of all the images (i.e. image-level labels), which is a natural setting for social image collections (e.g. Flickr). By oversegmenting all the images into regions, we formulate noisily tagged image parsing as a weakly supervised sparse learning problem over all the regions, where the initial labels of each region are inferred from image-level labels. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve such weakly supervised sparse learning problem. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. More notably, the reported surprising results shed some light on answering the question: can image-level labels replace pixel-level labels (hard to access) as supervisory information for image parsing.

- **Summary**: This report is a summary of research conducted on cloth tracking for automated textile manufacturing during a two semester long research course at Georgia Tech. This work was completed in 2009. Advances in current sensing technology such as the Microsoft Kinect would now allow me to relax certain assumptions and generally improve the tracking performance. This is because a major part of my approach described in this paper was to track features in a 2D image and use these to estimate the cloth deformation. Innovations such as the Kinect would improve estimation due to the automatic depth information obtained when tracking 2D pixel locations. Additionally, higher resolution camera images would probably give better quality feature tracking. However, although I would use different technology now to implement this tracker, the algorithm described and implemented in this paper is still a viable approach which is why I am publishing this as a tech report for reference. In addition, although the related work is a bit exhaustive, it will be useful to a reader who is new to methods for tracking and estimation as well as modeling of cloth.

- **Summary**: This paper describe the features extraction algorithm for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal using Huang Hilbert Transform and Wavelet Transform. ECG signal for an individual human being is different due to unique heart structure. The purpose of feature extraction of ECG signal would allow successful abnormality detection and efficient prognosis due to heart disorder. Some major important features will be extracted from ECG signals such as amplitude, duration, pre-gradient, post-gradient and so on. Therefore, we need a strong mathematical model to extract such useful parameter. Here an adaptive mathematical analysis model is Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). This new approach, the Hilbert-Huang transform, is implemented to analyze the non-linear and nonstationary data. It is unique and different from the existing methods of data analysis and does not require an a priori functional basis. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through the simulation.

- **Summary**: A rigid-motion scattering computes adaptive invariants along translations and rotations, with a deep convolutional network. Convolutions are calculated on the rigid-motion group, with wavelets defined on the translation and rotation variables. It preserves joint rotation and translation information, while providing global invariants at any desired scale. Texture classification is studied, through the characterization of stationary processes from a single realization. State-of-the-art results are obtained on multiple texture data bases, with important rotation and scaling variabilities.

- **Summary**: Compressed Sensing (CS) is suitable for remote acquisition of hyperspectral images for earth observation, since it could exploit the strong spatial and spectral correlations, llowing to simplify the architecture of the onboard sensors. Solutions proposed so far tend to decouple spatial and spectral dimensions to reduce the complexity of the reconstruction, not taking into account that onboard sensors progressively acquire spectral rows rather than acquiring spectral channels. For this reason, we propose a novel progressive CS architecture based on separate sensing of spectral rows and joint reconstruction employing Total Variation. Experimental results run on raw AVIRIS and AIRS images confirm the validity of the proposed system.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a low-rank representation with symmetric constraint (LRRSC) method for robust subspace clustering. Given a collection of data points approximately drawn from multiple subspaces, the proposed technique can simultaneously recover the dimension and members of each subspace. LRRSC extends the original low-rank representation algorithm by integrating a symmetric constraint into the low-rankness property of high-dimensional data representation. The symmetric low-rank representation, which preserves the subspace structures of high-dimensional data, guarantees weight consistency for each pair of data points so that highly correlated data points of subspaces are represented together. Moreover, it can be efficiently calculated by solving a convex optimization problem. We provide a rigorous proof for minimizing the nuclear-norm regularized least square problem with a symmetric constraint. The affinity matrix for spectral clustering can be obtained by further exploiting the angular information of the principal directions of the symmetric low-rank representation. This is a critical step towards evaluating the memberships between data points. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of LRRSC compared with several state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.

- **Summary**: Features selection is an essential step for successful data classification, since it reduces the data dimensionality by removing redundant features. Consequently, that minimizes the classification complexity and time in addition to maximizing its accuracy. In this article, a comparative study considering six features selection heuristics is conducted in order to select the best relevant features subset. The tested features vector consists of fourteen features that are computed for each pixel in the field of view of retinal images in the DRIVE database. The comparison is assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measurements of the recommended features subset resulted by each heuristic when applied with the ant colony system. Experimental results indicated that the features subset recommended by the relief heuristic outperformed the subsets recommended by the other experienced heuristics.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown their promise as a universal representation for recognition. However, global CNN activations lack geometric invariance, which limits their robustness for classification and matching of highly variable scenes. To improve the invariance of CNN activations without degrading their discriminative power, this paper presents a simple but effective scheme called multi-scale orderless pooling (MOP-CNN). This scheme extracts CNN activations for local patches at multiple scale levels, performs orderless VLAD pooling of these activations at each level separately, and concatenates the result. The resulting MOP-CNN representation can be used as a generic feature for either supervised or unsupervised recognition tasks, from image classification to instance-level retrieval; it consistently outperforms global CNN activations without requiring any joint training of prediction layers for a particular target dataset. In absolute terms, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging SUN397 and MIT Indoor Scenes classification datasets, and competitive results on ILSVRC2012/2013 classification and INRIA Holidays retrieval datasets.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a method of capturing objects appearances from its environment and it also describes how to recognize unknown appearances creating an eigenspace. This representation and recognition can be done automatically taking objects various appearances by using robotic vision from a defined environment. This technique also allows extracting objects from some sort of complicated scenes. In this case, some of object appearances are taken with defined occlusions and eigenspaces are created by accepting both of non-occluded and occluded appearances together. Eigenspace is constructed successfully every times when a new object appears, and various appearances accumulated gradually. A sequence of appearances is generated from its accumulated shapes, which is used for recognition of the unknown objects appearances. Various objects environments are shown in the experiment to capture objects appearances and experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: A large number of problems in computer vision can be modelled as energy minimization problems in a Markov Random Field (MRF) or Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. Graph-cuts based $\alpha$-expansion is a standard move-making method to minimize the energy functions with sub-modular pairwise terms. However, certain problems require more complex pairwise terms where the $\alpha$-expansion method is generally not applicable.   In this paper, we propose an iterative {\em tiered move making algorithm} which is able to handle general pairwise terms. Each move to the next configuration is based on the current labeling and an optimal tiered move, where each tiered move requires one application of the dynamic programming based tiered labeling method introduced in Felzenszwalb et. al. \cite{tiered_cvpr_felzenszwalbV10}. The algorithm converges to a local minimum for any general pairwise potential, and we give a theoretical analysis of the properties of the algorithm, characterizing the situations in which we can expect good performance. We first evaluate our method on an object-class segmentation problem using the Pascal VOC-11 segmentation dataset where we learn general pairwise terms. Further we evaluate the algorithm on many other benchmark labeling problems such as stereo, image segmentation, image stitching and image denoising. Our method consistently gets better accuracy and energy values than alpha-expansion, loopy belief propagation (LBP), quadratic pseudo-boolean optimization (QPBO), and is competitive with TRWS.

- **Summary**: Dimensionality reduction, cluster analysis, and sparse representation are basic components in machine learning. However, their relationships have not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we find that the spectral graph theory underlies a series of these elementary methods and can unify them into a complete framework. The methods include PCA, K-means, Laplacian eigenmap (LE), ratio cut (Rcut), and a new sparse representation method developed by us, called spectral sparse representation (SSR). Further, extended relations to conventional over-complete sparse representations (e.g., method of optimal directions, KSVD), manifold learning (e.g., kernel PCA, multidimensional scaling, Isomap, locally linear embedding), and subspace clustering (e.g., sparse subspace clustering, low-rank representation) are incorporated. We show that, under an ideal condition from the spectral graph theory, PCA, K-means, LE, and Rcut are unified together. And when the condition is relaxed, the unification evolves to SSR, which lies in the intermediate between PCA/LE and K-mean/Rcut. An efficient algorithm, NSCrt, is developed to solve the sparse codes of SSR. SSR combines merits of both sides: its sparse codes reduce dimensionality of data meanwhile revealing cluster structure. For its inherent relation to cluster analysis, the codes of SSR can be directly used for clustering. Scut, a clustering approach derived from SSR reaches the state-of-the-art performance in the spectral clustering family. The one-shot solution obtained by Scut is comparable to the optimal result of K-means that are run many times. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate the properties and strengths of SSR, NSCrt, and Scut.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen growing interest in exploiting dual- and multi-energy measurements in computed tomography (CT) in order to characterize material properties as well as object shape. Material characterization is performed by decomposing the scene into constitutive basis functions, such as Compton scatter and photoelectric absorption functions. While well motivated physically, the joint recovery of the spatial distribution of photoelectric and Compton properties is severely complicated by the fact that the data are several orders of magnitude more sensitive to Compton scatter coefficients than to photoelectric absorption, so small errors in Compton estimates can create large artifacts in the photoelectric estimate. To address these issues, we propose a model-based iterative approach which uses patch-based regularization terms to stabilize inversion of photoelectric coefficients, and solve the resulting problem though use of computationally attractive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution techniques. Using simulations and experimental data acquired on a commercial scanner, we demonstrate that the proposed processing can lead to more stable material property estimates which should aid materials characterization in future dual- and multi-energy CT systems.

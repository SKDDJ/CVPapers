- **Summary**: In the beginning stage, face verification is done using easy method of geometric algorithm models, but the verification route has now developed into a scientific progress of complicated geometric representation and identical procedure. In recent years the technologies have boosted face recognition system into the healthy focus. Researchers currently undergoing strong research on finding face recognition system for wider area information taken under hysterical elucidation dissimilarity. The proposed face recognition system consists of a narrative expositionindiscreet preprocessing method, a hybrid Fourier-based facial feature extraction and a score fusion scheme. We have verified the face recognition in different lightening conditions (day or night) and at different locations (indoor or outdoor). Preprocessing, Image detection, Feature- extraction and Face recognition are the methods used for face verification system. This paper focuses mainly on the issue of toughness to lighting variations. The proposed system has obtained an average of 88.1% verification rate on Two-Dimensional images under different lightening conditions.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification is particularly challenging due to significant appearance changes across separate camera views. In order to re-identify people, a representative human signature should effectively handle differences in illumination, pose and camera parameters. While general appearance-based methods are modelled in Euclidean spaces, it has been argued that some applications in image and video analysis are better modelled via non-Euclidean manifold geometry. To this end, recent approaches represent images as covariance matrices, and interpret such matrices as points on Riemannian manifolds. As direct classification on such manifolds can be difficult, in this paper we propose to represent each manifold point as a vector of similarities to class representers, via a recently introduced form of Bregman matrix divergence known as the Stein divergence. This is followed by using a discriminative mapping of similarity vectors for final classification. The use of similarity vectors is in contrast to the traditional approach of embedding manifolds into tangent spaces, which can suffer from representing the manifold structure inaccurately. Comparative evaluations on benchmark ETHZ and iLIDS datasets for the person re-identification task show that the proposed approach obtains better performance than recent techniques such as Histogram Plus Epitome, Partial Least Squares, and Symmetry-Driven Accumulation of Local Features.

- **Summary**: Recent advances suggest that encoding images through Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and then interpreting such matrices as points on Riemannian manifolds can lead to increased classification performance. Taking into account manifold geometry is typically done via (1) embedding the manifolds in tangent spaces, or (2) embedding into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). While embedding into tangent spaces allows the use of existing Euclidean-based learning algorithms, manifold shape is only approximated which can cause loss of discriminatory information. The RKHS approach retains more of the manifold structure, but may require non-trivial effort to kernelise Euclidean-based learning algorithms. In contrast to the above approaches, in this paper we offer a novel solution that allows SPD matrices to be used with unmodified Euclidean-based learning algorithms, with the true manifold shape well-preserved. Specifically, we propose to project SPD matrices using a set of random projection hyperplanes over RKHS into a random projection space, which leads to representing each matrix as a vector of projection coefficients. Experiments on face recognition, person re-identification and texture classification show that the proposed approach outperforms several recent methods, such as Tensor Sparse Coding, Histogram Plus Epitome, Riemannian Locality Preserving Projection and Relational Divergence Classification.

- **Summary**: Vectorization of images is a key concern uniting computer graphics and computer vision communities. In this paper we are presenting a novel idea for efficient, customizable vectorization of raster images, based on Catmull Rom spline fitting. The algorithm maintains a good balance between photo-realism and photo abstraction, and hence is applicable to applications with artistic concerns or applications where less information loss is crucial. The resulting algorithm is fast, parallelizable and can satisfy general soft realtime requirements. Moreover, the smoothness of the vectorized images aesthetically outperforms outputs of many polygon-based methods

- **Summary**: In this paper, we consider the problem of fast and efficient indexing techniques for sequences evolving in non-Euclidean spaces. This problem has several applications in the areas of human activity analysis, where there is a need to perform fast search, and recognition in very high dimensional spaces. The problem is made more challenging when representations such as landmarks, contours, and human skeletons etc. are naturally studied in a non-Euclidean setting where even simple operations are much more computationally intensive than their Euclidean counterparts. We propose a geometry and data adaptive symbolic framework that is shown to enable the deployment of fast and accurate algorithms for activity recognition, dynamic texture recognition, motif discovery. Toward this end, we present generalizations of key concepts of piece-wise aggregation and symbolic approximation for the case of non-Euclidean manifolds. We show that one can replace expensive geodesic computations with much faster symbolic computations with little loss of accuracy in activity recognition and discovery applications. The framework is general enough to work across both Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces, depending on appropriate feature representations without compromising on the ultra-low bandwidth, high speed and high accuracy. The proposed methods are ideally suited for real-time systems and low complexity scenarios.

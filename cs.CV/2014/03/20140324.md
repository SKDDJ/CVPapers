- **Summary**: Dynamic texture refers to image sequences of non-rigid objects that exhibit some regularity in their movement. Videos of smoke, fire etc. fall under the category of dynamic texture. Researchers have investigated different ways to analyze dynamic textures since early nineties. Both appearance based (image intensities) and motion based approaches are investigated. Motion based approaches turn out to be more effective. A group of researchers have investigated ways to utilize the motion vectors readily available with the blocks in video codes like MGEG/H26X. In this paper we provide a review of the dynamic texture analysis methods using block motion. Research into dynamic texture analysis using block motion includes recognition, motion computation, segmentation, and synthesis. We provide a comprehensive review of these approaches.

- **Summary**: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) have marked difficulties using verbal and non-verbal communication for social interaction. The running ASC-Inclusion project aims to help children with ASC by allowing them to learn how emotions can be expressed and recognised via playing games in a virtual world. The platform includes analysis of users' gestures, facial, and vocal expressions using standard microphone and web-cam or a depth sensor, training through games, text communication with peers, animation, video and audio clips. We present the state of play in realising such a serious game platform and provide results for the different modalities.

- **Summary**: A major issue with Time of Flight sensors is the presence of multipath interference. We present Sparse Reflections Analysis (SRA), an algorithm for removing this interference which has two main advantages. First, it allows for very general forms of multipath, including interference with three or more paths, diffuse multipath resulting from Lambertian surfaces, and combinations thereof. SRA removes this general multipath with robust techniques based on $L_1$ optimization. Second, due to a novel dimension reduction, we are able to produce a very fast version of SRA, which is able to run at frame rate. Experimental results on both synthetic data with ground truth, as well as real images of challenging scenes, validate the approach.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation some of the challenging issues on brain magnetic resonance image tumor segmentation caused by the weak correlation between magnetic resonance imaging intensity and anatomical meaning.With the objective of utilizing more meaningful information to improve brain tumor segmentation,an approach which employs bilateral symmetry information as an additional feature for segmentation is proposed.This is motivated by potential performance improvement in the general automatic brain tumor segmentation systems which are important for many medical and scientific applications.Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging segmentation is a complex problem in the field of medical imaging despite various presented methods.MR image of human brain can be divided into several sub-regions especially soft tissues such as gray matter,white matter and cerebra spinal fluid.Although edge information is the main clue in image segmentation,it cannot get a better result in analysis the content of images without combining other information.Our goal is to detect the position and boundary of tumors automatically.Experiments were conducted on real pictures,and the results show that the algorithm is flexible and convenient.

- **Summary**: Point constellation recognition is a common problem with many pattern matching applications. Whilst useful in many contexts, this work is mainly motivated by fingerprint matching. Fingerprints are traditionally modelled as constellations of oriented points called minutiae. The fingerprint verifier's task consists in comparing two point constellations. The compared constellations may differ by rotation and translation or by much more involved transforms such as distortion or occlusion. This paper presents three new constellation matching algorithms. The first two methods generalize an algorithm by Bringer and Despiegel. Our third proposal creates a very interesting analogy between mechanical system simulation and the constellation recognition problem.

- **Summary**: Humans can easily describe what they see in a coherent way and at varying level of detail. However, existing approaches for automatic video description are mainly focused on single sentence generation and produce descriptions at a fixed level of detail. In this paper, we address both of these limitations: for a variable level of detail we produce coherent multi-sentence descriptions of complex videos. We follow a two-step approach where we first learn to predict a semantic representation (SR) from video and then generate natural language descriptions from the SR. To produce consistent multi-sentence descriptions, we model across-sentence consistency at the level of the SR by enforcing a consistent topic. We also contribute both to the visual recognition of objects proposing a hand-centric approach as well as to the robust generation of sentences using a word lattice. Human judges rate our multi-sentence descriptions as more readable, correct, and relevant than related work. To understand the difference between more detailed and shorter descriptions, we collect and analyze a video description corpus of three levels of detail.

- **Summary**: We investigate improvements to our 3D model observer with the goal of better matching human observer performance as a function of viewing distance, effective contrast, maximum luminance, and browsing speed. Two nonlinear methods of applying the human contrast sensitivity function (CSF) to a 3D model observer are proposed, namely the Probability Map (PM) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. In the PM method, the visibility probability for each frequency component of the image stack, p, is calculated taking into account Barten's spatiotemporal CSF, the component modulation, and the human psychometric function. The probability p is considered to be equal to the perceived amplitude of the frequency component and thus can be used by a traditional model observer (e.g., LG-msCHO) in the space-time domain. In the MC method, each component is randomly kept with probability p or discarded with 1-p. The amplitude of the retained components is normalized to unity. The methods were tested using DBT stacks of an anthropomorphic breast phantom processed in a comprehensive simulation pipeline. Our experiments indicate that both the PM and MC methods yield results that match human observer performance better than the linear filtering method as a function of viewing distance, effective contrast, maximum luminance, and browsing speed.

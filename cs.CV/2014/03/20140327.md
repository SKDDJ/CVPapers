- **Summary**: The goal of this paper is to identify individuals by analyzing their gait. Instead of using binary silhouettes as input data (as done in many previous works) we propose and evaluate the use of motion descriptors based on densely sampled short-term trajectories. We take advantage of state-of-the-art people detectors to define custom spatial configurations of the descriptors around the target person. Thus, obtaining a pyramidal representation of the gait motion. The local motion features (described by the Divergence-Curl-Shear descriptor) extracted on the different spatial areas of the person are combined into a single high-level gait descriptor by using the Fisher Vector encoding. The proposed approach, coined Pyramidal Fisher Motion, is experimentally validated on the recent `AVA Multiview Gait' dataset. The results show that this new approach achieves promising results in the problem of gait recognition.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new constrained minimization problem that performs template and pattern detection on a multispectral image in a compressive sensing context. We use an original minimization problem from Guo and Osher that uses $L_1$ minimization techniques to perform template detection in a multispectral image. We first adapt this minimization problem to work with compressive sensing data. Then we extend it to perform pattern detection using a formal transform called the spectralization along a pattern. That extension brings out the problem of measurement reconstruction. We introduce shifted measurements that allow us to reconstruct all the measurement with a small overhead and we give an optimality constraint for simple patterns. We present numerical results showing the performances of the original minimization problem and the compressed ones with different measurement rates and applied on remotely sensed data.

- **Summary**: We present LS-CRF, a new method for very efficient large-scale training of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). It is inspired by existing closed-form expressions for the maximum likelihood parameters of a generative graphical model with tree topology. LS-CRF training requires only solving a set of independent regression problems, for which closed-form expression as well as efficient iterative solvers are available. This makes it orders of magnitude faster than conventional maximum likelihood learning for CRFs that require repeated runs of probabilistic inference. At the same time, the models learned by our method still allow for joint inference at test time. We apply LS-CRF to the task of semantic image segmentation, showing that it is highly efficient, even for loopy models where probabilistic inference is problematic. It allows the training of image segmentation models from significantly larger training sets than had been used previously. We demonstrate this on two new datasets that form a second contribution of this paper. They consist of over 180,000 images with figure-ground segmentation annotations. Our large-scale experiments show that the possibilities of CRF-based image segmentation are far from exhausted, indicating, for example, that semi-supervised learning and the use of non-linear predictors are promising directions for achieving higher segmentation accuracy in the future.

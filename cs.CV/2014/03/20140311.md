- **Summary**: Remote sensing image fusion is an effective way to use a large volume of data from multisensor images. Most earth satellites such as SPOT, Landsat 7, IKONOS and QuickBird provide both panchromatic (Pan) images at a higher spatial resolution and multispectral (MS) images at a lower spatial resolution and many remote sensing applications require both high spatial and high spectral resolutions, especially for GIS based applications. An effective image fusion technique can produce such remotely sensed images. Image fusion is the combination of two or more different images to form a new image by using a certain algorithm to obtain more and better information about an object or a study area than. The image fusion is performed at three different processing levels which are pixel level, feature level and decision level according to the stage at which the fusion takes place. There are many image fusion methods that can be used to produce high resolution multispectral images from a high resolution pan image and low resolution multispectral images. This paper explores the major remote sensing data fusion techniques at pixel level and reviews the concept, principals, limitations and advantages for each technique. This paper focused on traditional techniques like intensity hue-saturation- (HIS), Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA) and Wavelet.

- **Summary**: We first establish a law of large numbers and a convergence theorem in distribution to show the rate of convergence of the non-local means filter for removing Gaussian noise. We then introduce the notion of degree of similarity to measure the role of similarity for the non-local means filter. Based on the convergence theorems, we propose a patch-based weighted means filter for removing impulse noise and its mixture with Gaussian noise by combining the essential idea of the trilateral filter and that of the non-local means filter. Our experiments show that our filter is competitive compared to recently proposed methods.

- **Summary**: Facial analysis has attracted much attention in the technology for human-machine interface. Different methods of classification based on sparse representation and Gabor kernels have been widely applied in the fields of facial analysis. However, most of these methods treat face from a whole view standpoint. In terms of the importance of different facial views, in this paper, we present multi-view face analysis based on sparse representation and Gabor wavelet coefficients. To evaluate the performance, we conduct face analysis experiments including face recognition (FR) and face expression recognition (FER) on JAFFE database. Experiments are conducted from two parts: (1) Face images are divided into three facial parts which are forehead, eye and mouth. (2) Face images are divided into 8 parts by the orientation of Gabor kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly boost the performance and perform better than the other methods.

- **Summary**: Advances in computing technology increasingly blur the boundary between the digital domain and the physical world. Although the research community has developed a large number of cryptographic primitives and has demonstrated their usability in all-digital communication, many of them have not yet made their way into the real world due to usability aspects. We aim to make another step towards a tighter integration of digital cryptography into real world interactions. We describe Ubic, a framework that allows users to bridge the gap between digital cryptography and the physical world. Ubic relies on head-mounted displays, like Google Glass, resource-friendly computer vision techniques as well as mathematically sound cryptographic primitives to provide users with better security and privacy guarantees. The framework covers key cryptographic primitives, such as secure identification, document verification using a novel secure physical document format, as well as content hiding. To make a contribution of practical value, we focused on making Ubic as simple, easily deployable, and user friendly as possible.

- **Summary**: Sparse representation based classification (SRC) has been proved to be a simple, effective and robust solution to face recognition. As it gets popular, doubts on the necessity of enforcing sparsity starts coming up, and primary experimental results showed that simply changing the $l_1$-norm based regularization to the computationally much more efficient $l_2$-norm based non-sparse version would lead to a similar or even better performance. However, that's not always the case. Given a new classification task, it's still unclear which regularization strategy (i.e., making the coefficients sparse or non-sparse) is a better choice without trying both for comparison. In this paper, we present as far as we know the first study on solving this issue, based on plenty of diverse classification experiments. We propose a scoring function for pre-selecting the regularization strategy using only the dataset size, the feature dimensionality and a discrimination score derived from a given feature representation. Moreover, we show that when dictionary learning is taking into account, non-sparse representation has a more significant superiority to sparse representation. This work is expected to enrich our understanding of sparse/non-sparse collaborative representation for classification and motivate further research activities.

- **Summary**: Face recognition in real-time scenarios is mainly affected by illumination, expression and pose variations and also by occlusion. This paper presents the framework for pose adaptive component-based face recognition system. The framework proposed deals with all the above mentioned issues. The steps involved in the presented framework are (i) facial landmark localisation, (ii) facial component extraction, (iii) pre-processing of facial image (iv) facial pose estimation (v) feature extraction using Local Binary Pattern Histograms of each component followed by (vi) fusion of pose adaptive classification of components. By employing pose adaptive classification, the recognition process is carried out on some part of database, based on estimated pose, instead of applying the recognition process on the whole database. Pre-processing techniques employed to overcome the problems due to illumination variation are also discussed in this paper. Component-based techniques provide better recognition rates when face images are occluded compared to the holistic methods. Our method is simple, feasible and provides better results when compared to other holistic methods.



### Sparse Principal Component Analysis via Rotation and Truncation

- **Summary**: Sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA) aims at finding a sparse basis to improve the interpretability over the dense basis of PCA, meanwhile the sparse basis should cover the data subspace as much as possible. In contrast to most of existing work which deal with the problem by adding some sparsity penalties on various objectives of PCA, in this paper, we propose a new method SPCArt, whose motivation is to find a rotation matrix and a sparse basis such that the sparse basis approximates the basis of PCA after the rotation. The algorithm of SPCArt consists of three alternating steps: rotate PCA basis, truncate small entries, and update the rotation matrix. Its performance bounds are also given. SPCArt is efficient, with each iteration scaling linearly with the data dimension. It is easy to choose parameters in SPCArt, due to its explicit physical explanations. Besides, we give a unified view to several existing sparse PCA methods and discuss the connection with SPCArt. Some ideas in SPCArt are extended to GPower, a popular sparse PCA algorithm, to overcome its drawback. Experimental results demonstrate that SPCArt achieves the state-of-the-art performance. It also achieves a good tradeoff among various criteria, including sparsity, explained variance, orthogonality, balance of sparsity among loadings, and computational speed.

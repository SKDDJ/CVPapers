- **Summary**: Object recognition is still an impediment in the field of computer vision and multimedia retrieval.Defining an object model is a critical task. Shape information of an object play a critical role in the process of object recognition. Extraction of boundary information of an object from the multimedia data and classifying this information with associated objects is the primary step towards object recognition. Rasters play an important role while computing object boundary. The trade-off lies with the dimensionality of the object versus computational cost while achieving maximum efficiency. In this treatise an attempt is made to evaluate the performance of circular and spiral raster models in terms of average retrieval efficiency and computational cost.

- **Summary**: Computer vision is increasingly becoming interested in the rapid estimation of object detectors. Canonical hard negative mining strategies are slow as they require multiple passes of the large negative training set. Recent work has demonstrated that if the distribution of negative examples is assumed to be stationary, then Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can learn comparable detectors without ever revisiting the negative set. Even with this insight, however, the time to learn a single object detector can still be on the order of tens of seconds on a modern desktop computer. This paper proposes to leverage the resulting structured covariance matrix to obtain detectors with identical performance in orders of magnitude less time and memory. We elucidate an important connection to the correlation filter literature, demonstrating that these can also be trained without ever revisiting the negative set.

- **Summary**: Pel-recursive motion estimation isa well-established approach. However, in the presence of noise, it becomes an ill-posed problem that requires regularization. In this paper, motion vectors are estimated in an iterative fashion by means of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and a Gaussian data model. Our proposed algorithm also utilizes the local image properties of the scene to improve the motion vector estimates following a spatially adaptive approach. Numerical experiments are presented that demonstrate the merits of our method.

- **Summary**: An algorithmic framework to compute sparse or minimal-TV solutions of linear systems is proposed. The framework includes both the Kaczmarz method and the linearized Bregman method as special cases and also several new methods such as a sparse Kaczmarz solver. The algorithmic framework has a variety of applications and is especially useful for problems in which the linear measurements are slow and expensive to obtain. We present examples for online compressed sensing, TV tomographic reconstruction and radio interferometry.

- **Summary**: The aim of this paper is to present a new method for visual place recognition. Our system combines global image characterization and visual words, which allows to use efficient Bayesian filtering methods to integrate several images. More precisely, we extend the classical HMM model with techniques inspired by the field of Natural Language Processing. This paper presents our system and the Bayesian filtering algorithm. The performance of our system and the influence of the main parameters are evaluated on a standard database. The discussion highlights the interest of using such models and proposes improvements.

- **Summary**: Fractional order derivatives and integrals (differintegrals) are viewed from a frequency-domain perspective using the formalism of Riesz, providing a computational tool as well as a way to interpret the operations in the frequency domain. Differintegrals provide a logical extension of current techniques, generalizing the notion of integral and differential operators and acting as kind of frequency-domain filtering that has many of the advantages of a nonlocal linear operator. Several important properties of differintegrals are presented, and sample applications are given to one- and two-dimensional signals. Computer code to carry out the computations is made available on the author's website.

- **Summary**: Non-Local Total Variation (NLTV) has emerged as a useful tool in variational methods for image recovery problems. In this paper, we extend the NLTV-based regularization to multicomponent images by taking advantage of the Structure Tensor (ST) resulting from the gradient of a multicomponent image. The proposed approach allows us to penalize the non-local variations, jointly for the different components, through various $\ell_{1,p}$ matrix norms with $p \ge 1$. To facilitate the choice of the hyper-parameters, we adopt a constrained convex optimization approach in which we minimize the data fidelity term subject to a constraint involving the ST-NLTV regularization. The resulting convex optimization problem is solved with a novel epigraphical projection method. This formulation can be efficiently implemented thanks to the flexibility offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms. Experiments are carried out for multispectral and hyperspectral images. The results demonstrate the interest of introducing a non-local structure tensor regularization and show that the proposed approach leads to significant improvements in terms of convergence speed over current state-of-the-art methods.

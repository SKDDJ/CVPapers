- **Summary**: In Part 1, we developed a new technique based on Lipschitz pushforwards for proving the jump set containment property $\mathcal{H}^{m-1}(J_u \setminus J_f)=0$ of solutions $u$ to total variation denoising. We demonstrated that the technique also applies to Huber-regularised TV. Now, in this Part 2, we extend the technique to higher-order regularisers. We are not quite able to prove the property for total generalised variation (TGV) based on the symmetrised gradient for the second-order term. We show that the property holds under three conditions: First, the solution $u$ is locally bounded. Second, the second-order variable is of locally bounded variation, $w \in \mbox{BV}_\mbox{loc}(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^m)$, instead of just bounded deformation, $w \in \mbox{BD}(\Omega)$. Third, $w$ does not jump on $J_u$ parallel to it. The second condition can be achieved for non-symmetric TGV. Both the second and third condition can be achieved if we change the Radon (or $L^1$) norm of the symmetrised gradient $Ew$ into an $L^p$ norm, $p>1$, in which case Korn's inequality holds. We also consider the application of the technique to infimal convolution TV, and study the limiting behaviour of the singular part of $D u$, as the second parameter of $\mbox{TGV}^2$ goes to zero. Unsurprisingly, it vanishes, but in numerical discretisations the situation looks quite different. Finally, our work additionally includes a result on TGV-strict approximation in $\mbox{BV}(\Omega)$.

- **Summary**: We propose a simple and fast algorithm called PatchLift for computing distances between patches (contiguous block of samples) extracted from a given one-dimensional signal. PatchLift is based on the observation that the patch distances can be efficiently computed from a matrix that is derived from the one-dimensional signal using lifting; importantly, the number of operations required to compute the patch distances using this approach does not scale with the patch length. We next demonstrate how PatchLift can be used for patch-based denoising of images corrupted with Gaussian noise. In particular, we propose a separable formulation of the classical Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm that can be implemented using PatchLift. We demonstrate that the PatchLift-based implementation of separable NLM is few orders faster than standard NLM, and is competitive with existing fast implementations of NLM. Moreover, its denoising performance is shown to be consistently superior to that of NLM and some of its variants, both in terms of PSNR/SSIM and visual quality.

- **Summary**: The work describes the development of Online Assamese Stroke & Akshara Recognizer based on a set of language rules. In handwriting literature strokes are composed of two coordinate trace in between pen down and pen up labels. The Assamese aksharas are combination of a number of strokes, the maximum number of strokes taken to make a combination being eight. Based on these combinations eight language rule models have been made which are used to test if a set of strokes form a valid akshara. A Hidden Markov Model is used to train 181 different stroke patterns which generates a model used during stroke level testing. Akshara level testing is performed by integrating a GUI (provided by CDAC-Pune) with the Binaries of HTK toolkit classifier, HMM train model and the language rules using a dynamic linked library (dll). We have got a stroke level performance of 94.14% and akshara level performance of 84.2%.

- **Summary**: Recognition of Persian handwritten characters has been considered as a significant field of research for the last few years under pattern analysing technique. In this paper, a new approach for robust handwritten Persian numerals recognition using strong feature set and a classifier fusion method is scrutinized to increase the recognition percentage. For implementing the classifier fusion technique, we have considered k nearest neighbour (KNN), linear classifier (LC) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The innovation of this tactic is to attain better precision with few features using classifier fusion method. For evaluation of the proposed method we considered a Persian numerals database with 20,000 handwritten samples. Spending 15,000 samples for training stage, we verified our technique on other 5,000 samples, and the correct recognition ratio achieved approximately 99.90%. Additional, we got 99.97% exactness using four-fold cross validation procedure on 20,000 databases.

- **Summary**: Biofilm is a formation of microbial material on tooth substrata. Several methods to quantify dental biofilm coverage have recently been reported in the literature, but at best they provide a semi-automated approach to quantification with significant input from a human grader that comes with the graders bias of what are foreground, background, biofilm, and tooth. Additionally, human assessment indices limit the resolution of the quantification scale; most commercial scales use five levels of quantification for biofilm coverage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). On the other hand, current state-of-the-art techniques in automatic plaque quantification fail to make their way into practical applications owing to their inability to incorporate human input to handle misclassifications. This paper proposes a new interactive method for biofilm quantification in Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images of canine teeth that is independent of the perceptual bias of the grader. The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and intensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a realization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters are estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes (background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data. The quantification results show a high degree of consistency and precision. At the same time, the proposed method gives pathologists full control to post-process the automatic quantification by flipping misclassified superpixels to a different state (background, tooth, biofilm) with a single click, providing greater usability than simply marking the boundaries of biofilm and tooth as done by current state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recognizing fonts has become an important task in document analysis, due to the increasing number of available digital documents in different fonts and emphases. A generic font-recognition system independent of language, script and content is desirable for processing various types of documents. At the same time, categorizing calligraphy styles in handwritten manuscripts is important for palaeographic analysis, but has not been studied sufficiently in the literature. We address the font-recognition problem as analysis and categorization of textures. We extract features using complex wavelet transform and use support vector machines for classification. Extensive experimental evaluations on different datasets in four languages and comparisons with state-of-the-art studies show that our proposed method achieves higher recognition accuracy while being computationally simpler. Furthermore, on a new dataset generated from Ottoman manuscripts, we show that the proposed method can also be used for categorizing Ottoman calligraphy with high accuracy.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new hierarchical MDL-based model for a joint detection and classification of multilingual text lines in im- ages taken by hand-held cameras. The majority of related text detec- tion methods assume alphabet-based writing in a single language, e.g. in Latin. They use simple clustering heuristics specific to such texts: prox- imity between letters within one line, larger distance between separate lines, etc. We are interested in a significantly more ambiguous problem where images combine alphabet and logographic characters from multiple languages and typographic rules vary a lot (e.g. English, Korean, and Chinese). Complexity of detecting and classifying text lines in multiple languages calls for a more principled approach based on information- theoretic principles. Our new MDL model includes data costs combining geometric errors with classification likelihoods and a hierarchical sparsity term based on label costs. This energy model can be efficiently minimized by fusion moves. We demonstrate robustness of the proposed algorithm on a large new database of multilingual text images collected in the pub- lic transit system of Seoul.

- **Summary**: The Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation is widely used in computer vision. The size of the codebook impacts the time and space complexity of the applications that use BoW. Thus, given a training set for a particular computer vision task, a key problem is pruning a large codebook to select only a subset of visual words. Evaluating possible selections of words to be included in the pruned codebook can be computationally prohibitive; in a brute-force scheme, evaluating each pruned codebook requires re-coding of all features extracted from training images to words in the candidate codebook and then re-pooling the words to obtain a representation of each image, e.g., histogram of visual word frequencies. In this paper, a method is proposed that selects and evaluates a subset of words from an initially large codebook, without the need for re-coding or re-pooling. Formulations are proposed for two commonly-used schemes: hard and soft (kernel) coding of visual words with average-pooling. The effectiveness of these formulations is evaluated on the 15 Scenes and Caltech 10 benchmarks.

- **Summary**: scikit-image is an image processing library that implements algorithms and utilities for use in research, education and industry applications. It is released under the liberal "Modified BSD" open source license, provides a well-documented API in the Python programming language, and is developed by an active, international team of collaborators. In this paper we highlight the advantages of open source to achieve the goals of the scikit-image library, and we showcase several real-world image processing applications that use scikit-image.

- **Summary**: One of the most popular approaches to multi-target tracking is tracking-by-detection. Current min-cost flow algorithms which solve the data association problem optimally have three main drawbacks: they are computationally expensive, they assume that the whole video is given as a batch, and they scale badly in memory and computation with the length of the video sequence. In this paper, we address each of these issues, resulting in a computationally and memory-bounded solution. First, we introduce a dynamic version of the successive shortest-path algorithm which solves the data association problem optimally while reusing computation, resulting in significantly faster inference than standard solvers. Second, we address the optimal solution to the data association problem when dealing with an incoming stream of data (i.e., online setting). Finally, we present our main contribution which is an approximate online solution with bounded memory and computation which is capable of handling videos of arbitrarily length while performing tracking in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on the KITTI and PETS2009 benchmarks and show state-of-the-art performance, while being significantly faster than existing solvers.

- **Summary**: Human face perception is currently an active research area in the computer vision community. Skin detection is one of the most important and primary stages for this purpose. So far, many approaches are proposed to done this case. Near all of these methods have tried to find best match intensity distribution with skin pixels based on popular color spaces such as RGB, HSI or YCBCR. Results show that these methods cannot provide an accurate approach for every kind of skin. In this paper, an approach is proposed to solve this problem using a color probabilistic estimation technique. This approach is including two stages. In the first one, the skin intensity distribution is estimated using some train photos of pure skin, and at the second stage, the skin pixels are detected using Gaussian model and optimal threshold tuning. Then from the skin region facial features have been extracted to get the face from the skin region. In the results section, the proposed approach is applied on FEI database and the accuracy rate reached 99.25%. The proposed approach can be used for all kinds of skin using train stage which is the main advantage among the other advantages, such as Low noise sensitivity and low computational complexity.

- **Summary**: The objective of this paper is to design an efficient vehicle license plate recognition System and to implement it for automatic parking inventory system. The system detects the vehicle first and then captures the image of the front view of the vehicle. Vehicle license plate is localized and characters are segmented. For finding the place of plate, a novel and real time method is expressed. A new and robust technique based on directional chain code is used for character recognition. The resulting vehicle number is then compared with the available database of all the vehicles so as to come up with information about the vehicle type and to charge entrance cost accordingly. The system is then allowed to open parking barrier for the vehicle and generate entrance cost receipt. The vehicle information (such as entrance time, date, and cost amount) is also stored in the database to maintain the record. The hardware and software integrated system is implemented and a working prototype model is developed. Under the available database, the average accuracy of locating vehicle license plate obtained 100%. Using 70% samples of character for training, we tested our scheme on whole samples and obtained 100% correct recognition rate. Further we tested our character recognition stage on Persian vehicle data set and we achieved 99% correct recognition.

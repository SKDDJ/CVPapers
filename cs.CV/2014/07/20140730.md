- **Summary**: Several Scientific and engineering applications require merging of sampled images for complex perception development. In most cases, for such requirements, images are merged at intensity level. Even though it gives fairly good perception of combined scenario of objects and scenes, it is found that they are not sufficient enough to analyze certain engineering cases. The main problem is incoherent modulation of intensity arising out of phase properties being lost. In order to compensate these losses, combined phase and amplitude merge is demanded. We present here a method which could be used in precision engineering and biological applications where more precise prediction is required of a combined phenomenon. When pixels are added, its original property is lost but accurate merging of intended pixels can be achieved in high quality using frequency domain properties of an image. This paper introduces a technique to merge various images which can be used as a simple but effective technique for overlapped view of a set of images and producing reduced dataset for review purposes.

- **Summary**: Image processing is an important research area in computer vision. Image segmentation plays the vital rule in image processing research. There exist so many methods for image segmentation. Clustering is an unsupervised study. Clustering can also be used for image segmentation. In this paper, an in-depth study is done on different clustering techniques that can be used for image segmentation with their pros and cons. An experiment for color image segmentation based on clustering with K-Means algorithm is performed to observe the accuracy of clustering technique for the segmentation purpose.

- **Summary**: Shifting of objects in an image and merging many images after appropriate shifting is being used in several engineering and scientific applications which require complex perception development. A method has been presented here which could be used in precision engineering and biological applications where more precise prediction is required of a combined phenomenon with varying prominence of each phenomenon. Accurate merging of intended pixels can be achieved in high quality using frequency domain techniques even though initial properties of the original pixels are lost in this process. This paper introduces a technique to shift and merge various images with varying prominence of each image. A coefficient named prominence coefficient has been introduced which is capable of making some of the images transparent and highlighting the rest as per requirement of merging process which can be used as a simple but effective technique for overlapped view of a set of images.

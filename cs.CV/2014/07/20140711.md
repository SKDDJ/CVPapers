- **Summary**: We consider the problem of automatically prescribing oblique planes (short axis, 4 chamber and 2 chamber views) in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A concern with technologist-driven acquisitions of these planes is the quality and time taken for the total examination. We propose an automated solution incorporating anatomical features external to the cardiac region. The solution uses support vector machine regression models wherein complexity and feature selection are optimized using multi-objective genetic algorithms. Additionally, we examine the robustness of our approach by training our models on images with additive Rician-Gaussian mixtures at varying Signal to Noise (SNR) levels. Our approach has shown promising results, with an angular deviation of less than 15 degrees on 90% cases across oblique planes, measured in terms of average 6-fold cross validation performance -- this is generally within acceptable bounds of variation as specified by clinicians.

- **Summary**: Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) are stationary and feedforward. They neither change their parameters during evaluation nor use feedback from higher to lower layers. Real brains, however, do. So does our Deep Attention Selective Network (dasNet) architecture. DasNets feedback structure can dynamically alter its convolutional filter sensitivities during classification. It harnesses the power of sequential processing to improve classification performance, by allowing the network to iteratively focus its internal attention on some of its convolutional filters. Feedback is trained through direct policy search in a huge million-dimensional parameter space, through scalable natural evolution strategies (SNES). On the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, dasNet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model.

- **Summary**: Accurate and fast extraction of lung volumes from computed tomography (CT) scans remains in a great demand in the clinical environment because the available methods fail to provide a generic solution due to wide anatomical variations of lungs and existence of pathologies. Manual annotation, current gold standard, is time consuming and often subject to human bias. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art fully automated lung segmentation methods fail to make their way into the clinical practice due to their inability to efficiently incorporate human input for handling misclassifications and praxis. This paper presents a lung annotation tool for CT images that is interactive, efficient, and robust. The proposed annotation tool produces an "as accurate as possible" initial annotation based on the fuzzy-connectedness image segmentation, followed by efficient manual fixation of the initial extraction if deemed necessary by the practitioner. To provide maximum flexibility to the users, our annotation tool is supported in three major operating systems (Windows, Linux, and the Mac OS X). The quantitative results comparing our free software with commercially available lung segmentation tools show higher degree of consistency and precision of our software with a considerable potential to enhance the performance of routine clinical tasks.

- **Summary**: Accurate delineation of pathological lungs from computed tomography (CT) images remains mostly unsolved because available methods fail to provide a reliable generic solution due to high variability of abnormality appearance. Local descriptor-based classification methods have shown to work well in annotating pathologies; however, these methods are usually computationally intensive which restricts their widespread use in real-time or near-real-time clinical applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fast, accurate, reliable segmentation of pathological lungs from CT scans by combining region-based segmentation method with local descriptor classification that is performed on an optimized sampling grid. Our method works in two stages; during stage one, we adapted the fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm to perform initial lung parenchyma extraction. In the second stage, texture-based local descriptors are utilized to segment abnormal imaging patterns using a near optimal keypoint analysis by employing centroid of supervoxel as grid points. The quantitative results show that our pathological lung segmentation method is fast, robust, and improves on current standards and has potential to enhance the performance of routine clinical tasks.

- **Summary**: Low-resolution and signal-dependent noise distribution in positron emission tomography (PET) images makes denoising process an inevitable step prior to qualitative and quantitative image analysis tasks. Conventional PET denoising methods either over-smooth small-sized structures due to resolution limitation or make incorrect assumptions about the noise characteristics. Therefore, clinically important quantitative information may be corrupted. To address these challenges, we introduced a novel approach to remove signal-dependent noise in the PET images where the noise distribution was considered as Poisson-Gaussian mixed. Meanwhile, the generalized Anscombe's transformation (GAT) was used to stabilize varying nature of the PET noise. Other than noise stabilization, it is also desirable for the noise removal filter to preserve the boundaries of the structures while smoothing the noisy regions. Indeed, it is important to avoid significant loss of quantitative information such as standard uptake value (SUV)-based metrics as well as metabolic lesion volume. To satisfy all these properties, we extended bilateral filtering method into trilateral filtering through multiscaling and optimal Gaussianization process. The proposed method was tested on more than 50 PET-CT images from various patients having different cancers and achieved the superior performance compared to the widely used denoising techniques in the literature.

- **Summary**: In this paper we are particularly interested in the image inpainting problem using directional complex tight wavelet frames. Under the assumption that frame coefficients of images are sparse, several iterative thresholding algorithms for the image inpainting problem have been proposed in the literature. The outputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several convex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously combines the $l_1$-regularization for sparsity of frame coefficients and the $l_2$-regularization for smoothness of the solution. Due to the redundancy of a tight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and therefore, their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to close to each other. This is called the grouping effect in statistics. In this paper, we establish the grouping effect property for frame-based convex minimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect partially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for several image restoration problems. Inspired by recent development on directional tensor product complex tight framelets (TP-CTFs) and their impressive performance for the image denoising problem, in this paper we propose an iterative thresholding algorithm using a single tight frame derived from TP-CTFs for the image inpainting problem. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can handle well both cartoons and textures simultaneously and performs comparably and often better than several well-known frame-based iterative thresholding algorithms for the image inpainting problem without noise. For the image inpainting problem with additive zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, our proposed algorithm using TP-CTFs performs superior than other known state-of-the-art frame-based image inpainting algorithms.

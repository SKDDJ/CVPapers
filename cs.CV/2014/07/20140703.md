- **Summary**: Dental biofilm is the deposition of microbial material over a tooth substratum. Several methods have recently been reported in the literature for biofilm quantification; however, at best they provide a barely automated solution requiring significant input needed from the human expert. On the contrary, state-of-the-art automatic biofilm methods fail to make their way into clinical practice because of the lack of effective mechanism to incorporate human input to handle praxis or misclassified regions. Manual delineation, the current gold standard, is time consuming and subject to expert bias. In this paper, we introduce a new semi-automated software tool, BiofilmQuant, for dental biofilm quantification in quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images. The software uses a robust statistical modeling approach to automatically segment the QLF image into three classes (background, biofilm, and tooth substratum) based on the training data. This initial segmentation has shown a high degree of consistency and precision on more than 200 test QLF dental scans. Further, the proposed software provides the clinicians full control to fix any misclassified areas using a single click. In addition, BiofilmQuant also provides a complete solution for the longitudinal quantitative analysis of biofilm of the full set of teeth, providing greater ease of usability.

- **Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective approach to the problem of pedestrian detection which outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Our new features are built on the basis of low-level visual features and spatial pooling. Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus the robustness of the detection process. We then directly optimise the partial area under the ROC curve (\pAUC) measure, which concentrates detection performance in the range of most practical importance. The combination of these factors leads to a pedestrian detector which outperforms all competitors on all of the standard benchmark datasets. We advance state-of-the-art results by lowering the average miss rate from $13\%$ to $11\%$ on the INRIA benchmark, $41\%$ to $37\%$ on the ETH benchmark, $51\%$ to $42\%$ on the TUD-Brussels benchmark and $36\%$ to $29\%$ on the Caltech-USA benchmark.

- **Summary**: We consider a class of quasi-variational inequalities (QVIs) for adaptive image restoration, where the adaptivity is described via solution-dependent constraint sets. In previous work we studied both theoretical and numerical issues. While we were able to show the existence of solutions for a relatively broad class of problems, we encountered problems concerning uniqueness of the solution as well as convergence of existing algorithms for solving QVIs. In particular, it seemed that with increasing image size the growing condition number of the involved differential operator poses severe problems. In the present paper we prove uniqueness for a larger class of problems and in particular independent of the image size. Moreover, we provide a numerical algorithm with proved convergence. Experimental results support our theoretical findings.

- **Summary**: Object recognition in the video sequence or images is one of the sub-field of computer vision. Moving object recognition from a video sequence is an appealing topic with applications in various areas such as airport safety, intrusion surveillance, video monitoring, intelligent highway, etc. Moving object recognition is the most challenging task in intelligent video surveillance system. In this regard, many techniques have been proposed based on different methods. Despite of its importance, moving object recognition in complex environments is still far from being completely solved for low resolution videos, foggy videos, and also dim video sequences. All in all, these make it necessary to develop exceedingly robust techniques. This paper introduces multiple moving object recognition in the video sequence based on LoG Gabor-PCA approach and Angle based distance Similarity measures techniques used to recognize the object as a human, vehicle etc. Number of experiments are conducted for indoor and outdoor video sequences of standard datasets and also our own collection of video sequences comprising of partial night vision video sequences. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves an excellent recognition rate. Results obtained are satisfactory and competent.

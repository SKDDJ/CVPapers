- **Summary**: Representing images and videos with Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and considering the Riemannian geometry of the resulting space has proven beneficial for many recognition tasks. Unfortunately, computation on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices --especially of high-dimensional ones-- comes at a high cost that limits the applicability of existing techniques. In this paper we introduce an approach that lets us handle high-dimensional SPD matrices by constructing a lower-dimensional, more discriminative SPD manifold. To this end, we model the mapping from the high-dimensional SPD manifold to the low-dimensional one with an orthonormal projection. In particular, we search for a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold with maximum discriminative power encoded via an affinity-weighted similarity measure based on metrics on the manifold. Learning can then be expressed as an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold. Our evaluation on several classification tasks shows that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Modeling videos and image-sets as linear subspaces has proven beneficial for many visual recognition tasks. However, it also incurs challenges arising from the fact that linear subspaces do not obey Euclidean geometry, but lie on a special type of Riemannian manifolds known as Grassmannian. To leverage the techniques developed for Euclidean spaces (e.g, support vector machines) with subspaces, several recent studies have proposed to embed the Grassmannian into a Hilbert space by making use of a positive definite kernel. Unfortunately, only two Grassmannian kernels are known, none of which -as we will show- is universal, which limits their ability to approximate a target function arbitrarily well. Here, we introduce several positive definite Grassmannian kernels, including universal ones, and demonstrate their superiority over previously-known kernels in various tasks, such as classification, clustering, sparse coding and hashing.

- **Summary**: Hashing has proven a valuable tool for large-scale information retrieval. Despite much success, existing hashing methods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or graph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation criteria of interest---multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and NDCG. Here we present a general framework (termed StructHash) that allows one to directly optimize multivariate performance measures. The resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially or infinitely many variables and constraints, which is more challenging than standard structured output learning. To solve the StructHash optimization problem, we use a combination of column generation and cutting-plane techniques. We demonstrate the generality of StructHash by applying it to ranking prediction and image retrieval, and show that it outperforms a few state-of-the-art hashing methods.

- **Summary**: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by machine is an attractive research topic in signal processing domain and has attracted many researchers to contribute in this area. In recent year, there have been many advances in automatic speech reading system with the inclusion of audio and visual speech features to recognize words under noisy conditions. The objective of audio-visual speech recognition system is to improve recognition accuracy. In this paper we computed visual features using Zernike moments and audio feature using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) on vVISWa (Visual Vocabulary of Independent Standard Words) dataset which contains collection of isolated set of city names of 10 speakers. The visual features were normalized and dimension of features set was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to recognize the isolated word utterance on PCA space.The performance of recognition of isolated words based on visual only and audio only features results in 63.88 and 100 respectively.

- **Summary**: We are given a set of video clips, each one annotated with an {\em ordered} list of actions, such as "walk" then "sit" then "answer phone" extracted from, for example, the associated text script. We seek to temporally localize the individual actions in each clip as well as to learn a discriminative classifier for each action. We formulate the problem as a weakly supervised temporal assignment with ordering constraints. Each video clip is divided into small time intervals and each time interval of each video clip is assigned one action label, while respecting the order in which the action labels appear in the given annotations. We show that the action label assignment can be determined together with learning a classifier for each action in a discriminative manner. We evaluate the proposed model on a new and challenging dataset of 937 video clips with a total of 787720 frames containing sequences of 16 different actions from 69 Hollywood movies.

- **Summary**: Fish-eye cameras are becoming increasingly popular in computer vision, but their use for 3D measurement is limited partly due to the lack of an accurate, efficient and user-friendly calibration procedure. For such a purpose, we propose a method to calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (including radial distortion parameters) of two/multiple fish-eye cameras simultaneously by using a wand under general motions. Thanks to the generic camera model used, the proposed calibration method is also suitable for two/multiple conventional cameras and mixed cameras (e.g. two conventional cameras and a fish-eye camera). Simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we develop the camera calibration toolbox, which is available online.

- **Summary**: Recently, multiple formulations of vision problems as probabilistic inversions of generative models based on computer graphics have been proposed. However, applications to 3D perception from natural images have focused on low-dimensional latent scenes, due to challenges in both modeling and inference. Accounting for the enormous variability in 3D object shape and 2D appearance via realistic generative models seems intractable, as does inverting even simple versions of the many-to-many computations that link 3D scenes to 2D images. This paper proposes and evaluates an approach that addresses key aspects of both these challenges. We show that it is possible to solve challenging, real-world 3D vision problems by approximate inference in generative models for images based on rendering the outputs of probabilistic CAD (PCAD) programs. Our PCAD object geometry priors generate deformable 3D meshes corresponding to plausible objects and apply affine transformations to place them in a scene. Image likelihoods are based on similarity in a feature space based on standard mid-level image representations from the vision literature. Our inference algorithm integrates single-site and locally blocked Metropolis-Hastings proposals, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and discriminative data-driven proposals learned from training data generated from our models. We apply this approach to 3D human pose estimation and object shape reconstruction from single images, achieving quantitative and qualitative performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

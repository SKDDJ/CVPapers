- **Summary**: Texture plays an important role in many image analysis applications. In this paper, we give a performance evaluation of color texture classification by performing wavelet scattering network in various color spaces. Experimental results on the KTH_TIPS_COL database show that opponent RGB based wavelet scattering network outperforms other color spaces. Therefore, when dealing with the problem of color texture classification, opponent RGB based wavelet scattering network is recommended.

- **Summary**: Learning structured outputs with general structures is computationally challenging, except for tree-structured models. Thus we propose an efficient boosting-based algorithm AdaBoost.MRF for this task. The idea is based on the realization that a graph is a superimposition of trees. Different from most existing work, our algorithm can handle partial labelling, and thus is particularly attractive in practice where reliable labels are often sparsely observed. In addition, our method works exclusively on trees and thus is guaranteed to converge. We apply the AdaBoost.MRF algorithm to an indoor video surveillance scenario, where activities are modelled at multiple levels.

- **Summary**: License Plate Recognition plays an important role on the traffic monitoring and parking management. Administration and restriction of those transportation tools for their better service becomes very essential. In this paper, a fast and real time method has an appropriate application to find plates that the plat has tilt and the picture quality is poor. In the proposed method, at the beginning, the image is converted into binary mode with use of adaptive threshold. And with use of edge detection and morphology operation, plate number location has been specified and if the plat has tilt; its tilt is removed away. Then its characters are distinguished using image processing techniques. Finally, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier was used for character recognition. This method has been tested on available data set that has different images of the background, considering distance, and angel of view so that the correct extraction rate of plate reached at 98% and character recognition rate achieved at 99.12%. Further we tested our character recognition stage on Persian vehicle data set and we achieved 99% correct recognition rate.

- **Summary**: License Plate Recognition (LPR) plays an important role on the traffic monitoring and parking management. A robust and efficient method for enhancing accuracy of license plate characters recognition based on K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) classifier is presented in this paper. The system first prepares a contour form of the extracted character, then the angle and distance feature information about the character is extracted and finally K-NN classifier is used to character recognition. Angle and distance features of a character have been computed based on distribution of points on the bitmap image of character. In K-NN method, the Euclidean distance between testing point and reference points is calculated in order to find the k-nearest neighbours. We evaluated our method on the available dataset that contain 1200 sample. Using 70% samples for training, we tested our method on whole samples and obtained 99% correct recognition rate.Further, we achieved average 99.41% accuracy using three/strategy validation technique on 1200 dataset.

- **Summary**: Skin detection is one of the most important and primary stages in some of image processing applications such as face detection and human tracking. So far, many approaches are proposed to done this case. Near all of these methods have tried to find best match intensity distribution with skin pixels based on popular color spaces such as RGB, CMYK or YCbCr. Results show these methods cannot provide an accurate approach for every kinds of skin. In this paper, an approach is proposed to solve this problem using statistical features technique. This approach is including two stages. In the first one, from pure skin statistical features were extracted and at the second stage, the skin pixels are detected using HSV and YCbCr color spaces. In the result part, the proposed approach is applied on FEI database and the accuracy rate reached 99.25 + 0.2. Further proposed method is applied on complex background database and accuracy rate obtained 95.40+0.31%. The proposed approach can be used for all kinds of skin using train stage which is the main advantages of it. Low noise sensitivity and low computational complexity are some of other advantages.

  and fingerprint) using Gabor filter
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Biometric recognition systems have advanced significantly in the last decade and their use in specific applications will increase in the near future. The ability to conduct meaningful comparisons and assessments will be crucial to successful deployment and increasing biometric adoption. The best modality used as unimodal biometric systems are unable to fully address the problem of higher recognition rate. Multimodal biometric systems are able to mitigate some of the limitations encountered in unimodal biometric systems, such as non-universality, distinctiveness, non-acceptability, noisy sensor data, spoof attacks, and performance. More reliable recognition accuracy and performance are achievable as different modalities were being combined together and different algorithms or techniques were being used. The work presented in this paper focuses on a bimodal biometric system using face and fingerprint. An image enhancement technique (histogram equalization) is used to enhance the face and fingerprint images. Salient features of the face and fingerprint were extracted using the Gabor filter technique. A dimensionality reduction technique was carried out on both images extracted features using a principal component analysis technique. A feature level fusion algorithm (Mahalanobis distance technique) is used to combine each unimodal feature together. The performance of the proposed approach is validated and is effective.

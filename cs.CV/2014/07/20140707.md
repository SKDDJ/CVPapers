- **Summary**: In the last two years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved an impressive suite of results on standard recognition datasets and tasks. CNN-based features seem poised to quickly replace engineered representations, such as SIFT and HOG. However, compared to SIFT and HOG, we understand much less about the nature of the features learned by large CNNs. In this paper, we experimentally probe several aspects of CNN feature learning in an attempt to help practitioners gain useful, evidence-backed intuitions about how to apply CNNs to computer vision problems.

- **Summary**: This paper deals with the analysis of a recent reformulation of the primal-dual hybrid gradient method [Zhu and Chan 2008, Pock, Cremers, Bischof and Chambolle 2009, Esser, Zhang and Chan 2010, Chambolle and Pock 2011], which allows to apply it to nonconvex regularizers as first proposed for truncated quadratic penalization in [Strekalovskiy and Cremers 2014]. Particularly, it investigates variational problems for which the energy to be minimized can be written as $G(u) + F(Ku)$, where $G$ is convex, $F$ semiconvex, and $K$ is a linear operator. We study the method and prove convergence in the case where the nonconvexity of $F$ is compensated by the strong convexity of the $G$. The convergence proof yields an interesting requirement for the choice of algorithm parameters, which we show to not only be sufficient, but necessary. Additionally, we show boundedness of the iterates under much weaker conditions. Finally, we demonstrate effectiveness and convergence of the algorithm beyond the theoretical guarantees in several numerical experiments.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose novel methods for completion (from limited samples) and de-noising of multilinear (tensor) data and as an application consider 3-D and 4- D (color) video data completion and de-noising. We exploit the recently proposed tensor-Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD)[11]. Based on t-SVD, the notion of multilinear rank and a related tensor nuclear norm was proposed in [11] to characterize informational and structural complexity of multilinear data. We first show that videos with linear camera motion can be represented more efficiently using t-SVD compared to the approaches based on vectorizing or flattening of the tensors. Since efficiency in representation implies efficiency in recovery, we outline a tensor nuclear norm penalized algorithm for video completion from missing entries. Application of the proposed algorithm for video recovery from missing entries is shown to yield a superior performance over existing methods. We also consider the problem of tensor robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for de-noising 3-D video data from sparse random corruptions. We show superior performance of our method compared to the matrix robust PCA adapted to this setting as proposed in [4].



### Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We aim to detect all instances of a category in an image and, for each instance, mark the pixels that belong to it. We call this task Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation (SDS). Unlike classical bounding box detection, SDS requires a segmentation and not just a box. Unlike classical semantic segmentation, we require individual object instances. We build on recent work that uses convolutional neural networks to classify category-independent region proposals (R-CNN [16]), introducing a novel architecture tailored for SDS. We then use category-specific, top- down figure-ground predictions to refine our bottom-up proposals. We show a 7 point boost (16% relative) over our baselines on SDS, a 5 point boost (10% relative) over state-of-the-art on semantic segmentation, and state-of-the-art performance in object detection. Finally, we provide diagnostic tools that unpack performance and provide directions for future work.

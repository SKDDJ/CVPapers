- **Summary**: The paper presents to address this challenge, we have proposed the use of Adaptive Window Positioning technique which focuses on not just the meaning of the handwritten signature but also on the individuality of the writer. This innovative technique divides the handwritten signature into 13 small windows of size nxn(13x13).This size should be large enough to contain ample information about the style of the author and small enough to ensure a good identification performance.The process was tested with a GPDS data set containing 4870 signature samples from 90 different writers by comparing the robust features of the test signature with that of the user signature using an appropriate classifier. Experimental results reveal that adaptive window positioning technique proved to be the efficient and reliable method for accurate signature feature extraction for the identification of offline handwritten signatures.The contribution of this technique can be used to detect signatures signed under emotional duress.

- **Summary**: ARTOS is all about creating, tuning, and applying object detection models with just a few clicks. In particular, ARTOS facilitates learning of models for visual object detection by eliminating the burden of having to collect and annotate a large set of positive and negative samples manually and in addition it implements a fast learning technique to reduce the time needed for the learning step.   A clean and friendly GUI guides the user through the process of model creation, adaptation of learned models to different domains using in-situ images, and object detection on both offline images and images from a video stream. A library written in C++ provides the main functionality of ARTOS with a C-style procedural interface, so that it can be easily integrated with any other project.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Repeated brain MRI scans are performed in many clinical scenarios, such as follow up of patients with tumors and therapy response assessment. In this paper, the authors show an approach to utilize former scans of the patient for the acceleration of repeated MRI scans.   Methods: The proposed approach utilizes the possible similarity of the repeated scans in longitudinal MRI studies. Since similarity is not guaranteed, sampling and reconstruction are adjusted during acquisition to match the actual similarity between the scans. The baseline MR scan is utilized both in the sampling stage, via adaptive sampling, and in the reconstruction stage, with weighted reconstruction. In adaptive sampling, k-space sampling locations are optimized during acquisition. Weighted reconstruction uses the locations of the nonzero coefficients in the sparse domains as a prior in the recovery process. The approach was tested on 2D and 3D MRI scans of patients with brain tumors.   Results: The longitudinal adaptive CS MRI (LACS-MRI) scheme provides reconstruction quality which outperforms other CS-based approaches for rapid MRI. Examples are shown on patients with brain tumors and demonstrate improved spatial resolution. Compared with data sampled at Nyquist rate, LACS-MRI exhibits Signal-to-Error Ratio (SER) of 24.8dB with undersampling factor of 16.6 in 3D MRI.   Conclusions: The authors have presented a novel method for image reconstruction utilizing similarity of scans in longitudinal MRI studies, where possible. The proposed approach can play a major part and significantly reduce scanning time in many applications that consist of disease follow-up and monitoring of longitudinal changes in brain MRI.

- **Summary**: Models of object vision have been of great interest in computer vision and visual neuroscience. During the last decades, several models have been developed to extract visual features from images for object recognition tasks. Some of these were inspired by the hierarchical structure of primate visual system, and some others were engineered models. The models are varied in several aspects: models that are trained by supervision, models trained without supervision, and models (e.g. feature extractors) that are fully hard-wired and do not need training. Some of the models come with a deep hierarchical structure consisting of several layers, and some others are shallow and come with only one or two layers of processing. More recently, new models have been developed that are not hand-tuned but trained using millions of images, through which they learn how to extract informative task-related features. Here I will survey all these different models and provide the reader with an intuitive, as well as a more detailed, understanding of the underlying computations in each of the models.

- **Summary**: Many pattern recognition methods rely on statistical information from centered data, with the eigenanalysis of an empirical central moment, such as the covariance matrix in principal component analysis (PCA), as well as partial least squares regression, canonical-correlation analysis and Fisher discriminant analysis. Recently, many researchers advocate working on non-centered data. This is the case for instance with the singular value decomposition approach, with the (kernel) entropy component analysis, with the information-theoretic learning framework, and even with nonnegative matrix factorization. Moreover, one can also consider a non-centered PCA by using the second-order non-central moment.   The main purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between these two viewpoints in designing machine learning methods. To provide a study at the cornerstone of kernel-based machines, we conduct an eigenanalysis of the inner product matrices from centered and non-centered data. We derive several results connecting their eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. Furthermore, we explore the outer product matrices, by providing several results connecting the largest eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and its non-centered counterpart. These results lay the groundwork to several extensions beyond conventional centering, with the weighted mean shift, the rank-one update, and the multidimensional scaling. Experiments conducted on simulated and real data illustrate the relevance of this work.

- **Summary**: The mean shift algorithm is a non-parametric and iterative technique that has been used for finding modes of an estimated probability density function. It has been successfully employed in many applications in specific areas of machine vision, pattern recognition, and image processing. Although the mean shift algorithm has been used in many applications, a rigorous proof of its convergence is still missing in the literature. In this paper we address the convergence of the mean shift algorithm in the one-dimensional space and prove that the sequence generated by the mean shift algorithm is a monotone and convergent sequence.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method for real-time high density impulse noise suppression from images. In our method, we first apply an impulse detector to identify the corrupted pixels and then employ an innovative weighted-average filter to restore them. The filter takes the nearest neighboring interpolated image as the initial image and computes the weights according to the relative positions of the corrupted and uncorrupted pixels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the best existing methods in both PSNR measure and visual quality and is quite suitable for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: We attack the problem of learning face models for public faces from weakly-labelled images collected from web through querying a name. The data is very noisy even after face detection, with several irrelevant faces corresponding to other people. We propose a novel method, Face Association through Model Evolution (FAME), that is able to prune the data in an iterative way, for the face models associated to a name to evolve. The idea is based on capturing discriminativeness and representativeness of each instance and eliminating the outliers. The final models are used to classify faces on novel datasets with possibly different characteristics. On benchmark datasets, our results are comparable to or better than state-of-the-art studies for the task of face identification.

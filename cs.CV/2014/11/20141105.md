- **Summary**: The recently proposed principal component analysis network (PCANet) has been proved high performance for visual content classification. In this letter, we develop a tensorial extension of PCANet, namely, multilinear principal analysis component network (MPCANet), for tensor object classification. Compared to PCANet, the proposed MPCANet uses the spatial structure and the relationship between each dimension of tensor objects much more efficiently. Experiments were conducted on different visual content datasets including UCF sports action video sequences database and UCF11 database. The experimental results have revealed that the proposed MPCANet achieves higher classification accuracy than PCANet for tensor object classification.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a multilinear discriminant analysis network (MLDANet) for the recognition of multidimensional objects, known as tensor objects. The MLDANet is a variation of linear discriminant analysis network (LDANet) and principal component analysis network (PCANet), both of which are the recently proposed deep learning algorithms. The MLDANet consists of three parts: 1) The encoder learned by MLDA from tensor data. 2) Features maps ob-tained from decoder. 3) The use of binary hashing and histogram for feature pooling. A learning algorithm for MLDANet is described. Evaluations on UCF11 database indicate that the proposed MLDANet outperforms the PCANet, LDANet, MPCA + LDA, and MLDA in terms of classification for tensor objects.

- **Summary**: Edges of an image are considered a crucial type of information. These can be extracted by applying edge detectors with different methodology. Edge detection is a vital step in computer vision tasks, because it is an essential issue for pattern recognition and visual interpretation. In this paper, we propose a new method for edge detection in images, based on the estimation by kernel of the probability density function. In our algorithm, pixels in the image with minimum value of density function are labeled as edges. The boundary between two homogeneous regions is defined in two domains: the spatial/lattice domain and the range/color domain. Extensive experimental evaluations proved that our edge detection method is significantly a competitive algorithm.

- **Summary**: A framework for online simultaneous localization, mapping and self-calibration is presented which can detect and handle significant change in the calibration parameters. Estimates are computed in constant-time by factoring the problem and focusing on segments of the trajectory that are most informative for the purposes of calibration. A novel technique is presented to detect the probability that a significant change is present in the calibration parameters. The system is then able to re-calibrate. Maximum likelihood trajectory and map estimates are computed using an asynchronous and adaptive optimization. The system requires no prior information and is able to initialize without any special motions or routines, or in the case where observability over calibration parameters is delayed. The system is experimentally validated to calibrate camera intrinsic parameters for a nonlinear camera model on a monocular dataset featuring a significant zoom event partway through, and achieves high accuracy despite unknown initial calibration parameters. Self-calibration and re-calibration parameters are shown to closely match estimates computed using a calibration target. The accuracy of the system is demonstrated with SLAM results that achieve sub-1% distance-travel error even in the presence of significant re-calibration events.

- **Summary**: The problem of optical character recognition, OCR, has been widely discussed in the literature. Having a hand-written text, the program aims at recognizing the text. Even though there are several approaches to this issue, it is still an open problem. In this paper we would like to propose an approach that uses K-nearest neighbors algorithm, and has the accuracy of more than 90%. The training and run time is also very short.

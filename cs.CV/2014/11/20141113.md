- **Summary**: There is a requirement to determine whether a given person of interest has already been observed over a network of cameras in video surveillance systems. A human appearance obtained in one camera is usually different from the ones obtained in another camera due to difference in illumination, pose and viewpoint, camera parameters. Being related to appearance-based approaches for person re-identification, we propose a novel method based on the dominant color histogram and spatial configuration of dominant color regions on human body parts. Dominant color histogram and spatial configuration of the dominant color regions based on dominant color descriptor(DCD) can be considered to be robust to illumination and pose, viewpoint changes. The proposed method is evaluated using benchmark video datasets. Experimental results using the cumulative matching characteristic(CMC) curve demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for person re-identification.

- **Summary**: Reconstruction and monitoring of displacement and strain fields is an important problem in engineering. We analyze the remote and non-obtrusive methods of strain measurement based on photogrammetry and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The method is based on covering the photographed surface with a pattern of speckles and comparing the images taken before and after the deformation. In this study, a comprehensive literature review and comparative analysis of photogrammetric solutions is presented. The analysis is based on a specially developed Digital Image Synthesizer To Reconstruct Strain in Solids (DISTRESS) Simulator to generate synthetic images of displacement and stress fields in order to investigate the intrinsic accuracy of the existing variants of DIC. We investigated the Basic DIC and a commercial software VIC 2D, both based on displacement field reconstruction with post processing strain determination based on numerical differentiation. We also investigated what we call the Extended DIC where the strain field is determined independently of the displacement field. While the Basic DIC and VIC 2D are faster, the Extended DIC delivers the best accuracy of strain reconstruction. The speckle pattern is found to be playing a critical role in achieving high accuracy for DIC. Increase in subset size for DIC does not significantly improves the accuracy, while the smallest subset size depends on the speckle pattern and speckle size. Increase in the overall image size provides more details but does not play significant role in improving the accuracy, while significantly increasing the computation cost.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a comparative study for window-based descriptors on the application of Arabic handwritten alphabet recognition. We show a detailed experimental evaluation of different descriptors with several classifiers. The objective of the paper is to evaluate different window-based descriptors on the problem of Arabic letter recognition. Our experiments clearly show that they perform very well. Moreover, we introduce a novel spatial pyramid partitioning scheme that enhances the recognition accuracy for most descriptors. In addition, we introduce a novel dataset for Arabic handwritten isolated alphabet letters, which can serve as a benchmark for future research.

- **Summary**: Gaze stabilization is an important requisite for humanoid robots. Previous work on this topic has focused on the integration of inertial and visual information. Little attention has been given to a third component, which is the knowledge that the robot has about its own movement. In this work we propose a comprehensive framework for gaze stabilization in a humanoid robot. We focus on the problem of compensating for disturbances induced in the cameras due to self-generated movements of the robot. In this work we employ two separate signals for stabilization: (1) an anticipatory term obtained from the velocity commands sent to the joints while the robot moves autonomously; (2) a feedback term from the on board gyroscope, which compensates unpredicted external disturbances. We first provide the mathematical formulation to derive the forward and the differential kinematics of the fixation point of the stereo system. We finally test our method on the iCub robot. We show that the stabilization consistently reduces the residual optical flow during the movement of the robot and in presence of external disturbances. We also demonstrate that proper integration of the neck DoF is crucial to achieve correct stabilization.

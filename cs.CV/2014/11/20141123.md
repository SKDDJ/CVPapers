- **Summary**: It has been recently shown that incorporating priori knowledge significantly improves the performance of basic compressive sensing based approaches. We have managed to successfully exploit this idea for recovering a matrix as a summation of a Low-rank and a Sparse component from compressive measurements. When applied to the problem of construction of 4D Cardiac MR image sequences in real-time from highly under-sampled $k-$space data, our proposed method achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We are interested in inferring object segmentation by leveraging only object class information, and by considering only minimal priors on the object segmentation task. This problem could be viewed as a kind of weakly supervised segmentation task, and naturally fits the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework: every training image is known to have (or not) at least one pixel corresponding to the image class label, and the segmentation task can be rewritten as inferring the pixels belonging to the class of the object (given one image, and its object class). We propose a Convolutional Neural Network-based model, which is constrained during training to put more weight on pixels which are important for classifying the image. We show that at test time, the model has learned to discriminate the right pixels well enough, such that it performs very well on an existing segmentation benchmark, by adding only few smoothing priors. Our system is trained using a subset of the Imagenet dataset and the segmentation experiments are performed on the challenging Pascal VOC dataset (with no fine-tuning of the model on Pascal VOC). Our model beats the state of the art results in weakly supervised object segmentation task by a large margin. We also compare the performance of our model with state of the art fully-supervised segmentation approaches.

- **Summary**: Interfaces based on projection screens have become increasingly more popular in recent years, mainly due to the large screen size and resolution that they provide, as well as their stereo-vision capabilities. This work shows a local method for real-time detection of non-stationary photometric perturbations in projected images by means of computer vision techniques. The method is based on the computation of differences between the images in the projector's frame buffer and the corresponding images on the projection screen observed by the camera. It is robust under spatial variations in the intensity of light emitted by the projector on the projection surface and also robust under stationary photometric perturbations caused by external factors. Moreover, we describe the experiments carried out to show the reliability of the method.

- **Summary**: Transformations of digital spaces preserving local and global topology play an important role in thinning, skeletonization and simplification of digital images. In the present paper, we introduce and study contractions of simple pair of points based on the notions of a digital contractible space and contractible transformations of digital spaces. We show that the contraction of a simple pair of points preserves local and global topology of a digital space. Relying on the obtained results, we study properties if digital manifolds. In particular, we show that a digital n-manifold can be transformed to its compressed form with the minimal number of points by sequential contractions of simple pairs.   Key Words: Graph, digital space, contraction, splitting, simple pair, homotopy, thinning

- **Summary**: Blind deconvolution is the problem of recovering a sharp image and a blur kernel from a noisy blurry image. Recently, there has been a significant effort on understanding the basic mechanisms to solve blind deconvolution. While this effort resulted in the deployment of effective algorithms, the theoretical findings generated contrasting views on why these approaches worked. On the one hand, one could observe experimentally that alternating energy minimization algorithms converge to the desired solution. On the other hand, it has been shown that such alternating minimization algorithms should fail to converge and one should instead use a so-called Variational Bayes approach. To clarify this conundrum, recent work showed that a good image and blur prior is instead what makes a blind deconvolution algorithm work. Unfortunately, this analysis did not apply to algorithms based on total variation regularization. In this manuscript, we provide both analysis and experiments to get a clearer picture of blind deconvolution. Our analysis reveals the very reason why an algorithm based on total variation works. We also introduce an implementation of this algorithm and show that, in spite of its extreme simplicity, it is very robust and achieves a performance comparable to the state of the art.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we develop an approach to exploiting kernel methods with manifold-valued data. In many computer vision problems, the data can be naturally represented as points on a Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, usual Euclidean computer vision and machine learning algorithms yield inferior results on such data. In this paper, we define Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)-based positive definite kernels on manifolds that permit us to embed a given manifold with a corresponding metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space. These kernels make it possible to utilize algorithms developed for linear spaces on nonlinear manifold-valued data. Since the Gaussian RBF defined with any given metric is not always positive definite, we present a unified framework for analyzing the positive definiteness of the Gaussian RBF on a generic metric space. We then use the proposed framework to identify positive definite kernels on two specific manifolds commonly encountered in computer vision: the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and the Grassmann manifold, i.e., the Riemannian manifold of linear subspaces of a Euclidean space. We show that many popular algorithms designed for Euclidean spaces, such as support vector machines, discriminant analysis and principal component analysis can be generalized to Riemannian manifolds with the help of such positive definite Gaussian kernels.

- **Summary**: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) commonly use generic `max-pooling' (MP) layers to extract deformation-invariant features, but we argue in favor of a more refined treatment. First, we introduce epitomic convolution as a building block alternative to the common convolution-MP cascade of DCNNs; while having identical complexity to MP, Epitomic Convolution allows for parameter sharing across different filters, resulting in faster convergence and better generalization. Second, we introduce a Multiple Instance Learning approach to explicitly accommodate global translation and scaling when training a DCNN exclusively with class labels. For this we rely on a `patchwork' data structure that efficiently lays out all image scales and positions as candidates to a DCNN. Factoring global and local deformations allows a DCNN to `focus its resources' on the treatment of non-rigid deformations and yields a substantial classification accuracy improvement. Third, further pursuing this idea, we develop an efficient DCNN sliding window object detector that employs explicit search over position, scale, and aspect ratio. We provide competitive image classification and localization results on the ImageNet dataset and object detection results on the Pascal VOC 2007 benchmark.

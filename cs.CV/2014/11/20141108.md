- **Summary**: Trademark Image Retrieval is playing a vital role as a part of CBIR System. Trademark is of great significance because it carries the status value of any company. To retrieve such a fake or copied trademark we design a retrieval system which is based on hybrid techniques. It contains a mixture of two different feature vector which combined together to give a suitable retrieval system. In the proposed system we extract the corner feature which is applied on an edge pixel image. This feature is used to extract the relevant image and to more purify the result we apply other feature which is the invariant moment feature. From the experimental result we conclude that the system is 85 percent efficient.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present feature-based technique for construction of mosaic image from underwater video sequence, which suffers from parallax distortion due to propagation properties of light in the underwater environment. The most of the available mosaic tools and underwater image mosaicing techniques yields final result with some artifacts such as blurring, ghosting and seam due to presence of parallax in the input images. The removal of parallax from input images may not reduce its effects instead it must be corrected in successive steps of mosaicing. Thus, our approach minimizes the parallax effects by adopting an efficient local alignment technique after global registration. We extract texture features using Centre Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CS-LBP) descriptor in order to find feature correspondences, which are used further for estimation of homography through RANSAC. In order to increase the accuracy of global registration, we perform preprocessing such as colour alignment between two selected frames based on colour distribution adjustment. Because of existence of 100% overlap in consecutive frames of underwater video, we select frames with minimum overlap based on mutual offset in order to reduce the computation cost during mosaicing. Our approach minimizes the parallax effects considerably in final mosaic constructed using our own underwater video sequences.

- **Summary**: In this paper a fast triangular mesh based registration method is proposed. Having Template and Reference images as inputs, the template image is triangulated using a content adaptive mesh generation algorithm. Considering the pixel values at mesh nodes, interpolated using spline interpolation method for both of the images, the energy functional needed for image registration is minimized. The minimization process was achieved using a mesh based discretization of the distance measure and regularization term which resulted in a sparse system of linear equations, which due to the smaller size in comparison to the pixel-wise registration method, can be solved directly. Mean Squared Difference (MSD) is used as a metric for evaluating the results. Using the mesh based technique, higher speed was achieved compared to pixel-based curvature registration technique with fast DCT solver. The implementation was done in MATLAB without any specific optimization. Higher speeds can be achieved using C/C++ implementations.

- **Summary**: Recently, Babenko and Lempitsky introduced Additive Quantization (AQ), a generalization of Product Quantization (PQ) where a non-independent set of codebooks is used to compress vectors into small binary codes. Unfortunately, under this scheme encoding cannot be done independently in each codebook, and optimal encoding is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we observe that PQ and AQ are both compositional quantizers that lie on the extremes of the codebook dependence-independence assumption, and explore an intermediate approach that exploits a hierarchical structure in the codebooks. This results in a method that achieves quantization error on par with or lower than AQ, while being several orders of magnitude faster. We perform a complexity analysis of PQ, AQ and our method, and evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks of SIFT and GIST descriptors, as well as on new datasets of features obtained from state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks.

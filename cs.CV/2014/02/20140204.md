- **Summary**: Scene labeling is the problem of assigning an object label to each pixel. It unifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance of using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely realized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This training strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at multiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is purely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments or shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as object segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms state-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also outperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and achieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).

- **Summary**: Face detection is a basic task for expression recognition. The reliability of face detection & face recognition approach has a major role on the performance and usability of the entire system. There are several ways to undergo face detection & recognition. We can use Image Processing Operations, various classifiers, filters or virtual machines for the former. Various strategies are being available for Facial Expression Detection. The field of facial expression detection can have various applications along with its importance & can be interacted between human being & computer. Many few options are available to identify a face in an image in accurate & efficient manner. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based texture algorithms have gained popularity in these years. LBP is an effective approach to have facial expression recognition & is a feature-based approach.

- **Summary**: We analyze the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in a lensless compressive imaging (LCI) architecture. The architecture consists of a sensor of a single detecting element and an aperture assembly of an array of programmable elements. LCI can be used in conjunction with compressive sensing to capture images in a compressed form of compressive measurements. In this paper, we perform SNR analysis of the LCI and compare it with imaging with a pinhole or a lens. We will show that the SNR in the LCI is independent of the image resolution, while the SNR in either pinhole aperture imaging or lens aperture imaging decreases as the image resolution increases. Consequently, the SNR in the LCI is much higher if the image resolution is large enough.

- **Summary**: Computer vision is hard because of a large variability in lighting, shape, and texture; in addition the image signal is non-additive due to occlusion. Generative models promised to account for this variability by accurately modelling the image formation process as a function of latent variables with prior beliefs. Bayesian posterior inference could then, in principle, explain the observation. While intuitively appealing, generative models for computer vision have largely failed to deliver on that promise due to the difficulty of posterior inference. As a result the community has favoured efficient discriminative approaches. We still believe in the usefulness of generative models in computer vision, but argue that we need to leverage existing discriminative or even heuristic computer vision methods. We implement this idea in a principled way with an "informed sampler" and in careful experiments demonstrate it on challenging generative models which contain renderer programs as their components. We concentrate on the problem of inverting an existing graphics rendering engine, an approach that can be understood as "Inverse Graphics". The informed sampler, using simple discriminative proposals based on existing computer vision technology, achieves significant improvements of inference.

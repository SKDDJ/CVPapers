- **Summary**: We extend the framework of efficient coding, which has been used to model the development of sensory processing in isolation, to model the development of the perception/action cycle. Our extension combines sparse coding and reinforcement learning so that sensory processing and behavior co-develop to optimize a shared intrinsic motivational signal: the fidelity of the neural encoding of the sensory input under resource constraints. Applying this framework to a model system consisting of an active eye behaving in a time varying environment, we find that this generic principle leads to the simultaneous development of both smooth pursuit behavior and model neurons whose properties are similar to those of primary visual cortical neurons selective for different directions of visual motion. We suggest that this general principle may form the basis for a unified and integrated explanation of many perception/action loops.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in video segmentation, many opportunities remain to improve it using a variety of low and mid-level visual cues. We propose improvements to the leading streaming graph-based hierarchical video segmentation (streamGBH) method based on early and mid level visual processing. The extensive experimental analysis of our approach validates the improvement of hierarchical supervoxel representation by incorporating motion and color with effective filtering. We also pose and illuminate some open questions towards intermediate level video analysis as further extension to streamGBH. We exploit the supervoxels as an initialization towards estimation of dominant affine motion regions, followed by merging of such motion regions in order to hierarchically segment a video in a novel motion-segmentation framework which aims at subsequent applications such as foreground recognition.

- **Summary**: Quality control at each stage of production in textile industry has become a key factor to retaining the existence in the highly competitive global market. Problems of manual fabric defect inspection are lack of accuracy and high time consumption, where early and accurate fabric defect detection is a significant phase of quality control. Computer vision based, i.e. automated fabric defect inspection systems are thought by many researchers of different countries to be very useful to resolve these problems. There are two major challenges to be resolved to attain a successful automated fabric defect inspection system. They are defect detection and defect classification. In this work, we discuss different techniques used for automated fabric defect classification, then show a survey of classifiers used in automated fabric defect inspection systems, and finally, compare these classifiers by using performance metrics. This work is expected to be very useful for the researchers in the area of automated fabric defect inspection to understand and evaluate the many potential options in this field.

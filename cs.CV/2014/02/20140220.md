- **Summary**: Content based image retrieval, a technique which uses visual contents of image to search images from large scale image databases according to users' interests. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent technology used in the area of content based face image retrieval. Nowadays digital devices and photo sharing sites are getting more popularity, large human face photos are available in database. Multiple types of facial features are used to represent discriminality on large scale human facial image database. Searching and mining of facial images are challenging problems and important research issues. Sparse representation on features provides significant improvement in indexing related images to query image.

- **Summary**: Triangular meshes have gained much interest in image representation and have been widely used in image processing. This paper introduces a framework of anisotropic mesh adaptation (AMA) methods to image representation and proposes a GPRAMA method that is based on AMA and greedy-point removal (GPR) scheme. Different than many other methods that triangulate sample points to form the mesh, the AMA methods start directly with a triangular mesh and then adapt the mesh based on a user-defined metric tensor to represent the image. The AMA methods have clear mathematical framework and provides flexibility for both image representation and image reconstruction. A mesh patching technique is developed for the implementation of the GPRAMA method, which leads to an improved version of the popular GPRFS-ED method. The GPRAMA method can achieve better quality than the GPRFS-ED method but with lower computational cost.

- **Summary**: Fingerprint recognition requires a minimal effort from the user, does not capture other information than strictly necessary for the recognition process, and provides relatively good performance. A critical step in fingerprint identification system is thinning of the input fingerprint image. The performance of a minutiae extraction algorithm relies heavily on the quality of the thinning algorithm. So, a fast fingerprint thinning algorithm is proposed. The algorithm works directly on the gray-scale image as binarization of fingerprint causes many spurious minutiae and also removes many important features. The performance of the thinning algorithm is evaluated and experimental results show that the proposed thinning algorithm is both fast and accurate. A new minutiae-based fingerprint matching technique is proposed. The main idea is that each fingerprint is represented by a minutiae table of just two columns in the database. The number of different minutiae types (terminations and bifurcations) found in each track of a certain width around the core point of the fingerprint is recorded in this table. Each row in the table represents a certain track, in the first column, the number of terminations in each track is recorded, in the second column, the number of bifurcations in each track is recorded. The algorithm is rotation and translation invariant, and needs less storage size. Experimental results show that recognition accuracy is 98%, with Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2%. Finally, the integrity of the data transmission via communication channels must be secure all the way from the scanner to the application. After applying Gaussian noise addition, and JPEG compression with high and moderate quality factors on the watermarked fingerprint images, recognition accuracy decreases slightly to reach 96%.

- **Summary**: The multi-scale Frangi vesselness filter is an established tool in (retinal) vascular imaging. However, it cannot cope with crossings or bifurcations, since it only looks for elongated structures. Therefore, we disentangle crossing structures in the image via (multiple scale) invertible orientation scores. The described vesselness filter via scale-orientation scores performs considerably better at enhancing vessels throughout crossings and bifurcations than the Frangi version. Both methods are evaluated on a public dataset. Performance is measured by comparing ground truth data to the segmentation results obtained by basic thresholding and morphological component analysis of the filtered images.

- **Summary**: Although psychological research indicates that bodily expressions convey important affective information, to date research in emotion recognition focused mainly on facial expression or voice analysis. In this paper we propose an approach to realtime automatic emotion recognition from body movements. A set of postural, kinematic, and geometrical features are extracted from sequences 3D skeletons and fed to a multi-class SVM classifier. The proposed method has been assessed on data acquired through two different systems: a professionalgrade optical motion capture system, and Microsoft Kinect. The system has been assessed on a "six emotions" recognition problem, and using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation strategy, reached an overall recognition rate of 61.3% which is very close to the recognition rate of 61.9% obtained by human observers. To provide further testing of the system, two games were developed, where one or two users have to interact to understand and express emotions with their body.

- **Summary**: We propose a new approach, {\it two-dimensional fused binary compressive sensing} (2DFBCS) to recover 2D sparse piece-wise signals from 1-bit measurements, exploiting 2D group sparsity for 1-bit compressive sensing recovery. The proposed method is a modified 2D version of the previous {\it binary iterative hard thresholding} (2DBIHT) algorithm, where the objective function includes a 2D one-sided $\ell_1$ (or $\ell_2$) penalty function encouraging agreement with the observed data, an indicator function of $K$-sparsity, and a total variation (TV) or modified TV (MTV) constraint. The subgradient of the 2D one-sided $\ell_1$ (or $\ell_2$) penalty and the projection onto the $K$-sparsity and TV or MTV constraint can be computed efficiently, allowing the appliaction of algorithms of the {\it forward-backward splitting} (a.k.a. {\it iterative shrinkage-thresholding}) family. Experiments on the recovery of 2D sparse piece-wise smooth signals show that the proposed approach is able to take advantage of the piece-wise smoothness of the original signal, achieving more accurate recovery than 2DBIHT. More specifically, 2DFBCS with the MTV and the $\ell_2$ penalty performs best amongst the algorithms tested.

- **Summary**: We propose a new method, {\it binary fused compressive sensing} (BFCS), to recover sparse piece-wise smooth signals from 1-bit compressive measurements. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the previous {\it binary iterative hard thresholding} (BIHT) algorithm, where, in addition to the sparsity constraint, the total-variation of the recovered signal is upper constrained. As in BIHT, the data term of the objective function is an one-sided $\ell_1$ (or $\ell_2$) norm. Experiments on the recovery of sparse piece-wise smooth signals show that the proposed algorithm is able to take advantage of the piece-wise smoothness of the original signal, achieving more accurate recovery than BIHT.

- **Summary**: We apply the OSCAR (octagonal selection and clustering algorithms for regression) in recovering group-sparse matrices (two-dimensional---2D---arrays) from compressive measurements. We propose a 2D version of OSCAR (2OSCAR) consisting of the $\ell_1$ norm and the pair-wise $\ell_{\infty}$ norm, which is convex but non-differentiable. We show that the proximity operator of 2OSCAR can be computed based on that of OSCAR. The 2OSCAR problem can thus be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art proximal splitting algorithms. Experiments on group-sparse 2D array recovery show that 2OSCAR regularization solved by the SpaRSA algorithm is the fastest choice, while the PADMM algorithm (with debiasing) yields the most accurate results.

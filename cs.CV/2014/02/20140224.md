- **Summary**: Tracking-by-detection has become an attractive tracking technique, which treats tracking as a category detection problem. However, the task in tracking is to search for a specific object, rather than an object category as in detection. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking framework based on exemplar detector rather than category detector. The proposed tracker is an ensemble of exemplar-based linear discriminant analysis (ELDA) detectors. Each detector is quite specific and discriminative, because it is trained by a single object instance and massive negatives. To improve its adaptivity, we update both object and background models. Experimental results on several challenging video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm.

- **Summary**: We propose a meta-parameter free, off-the-shelf, simple and fast unsupervised feature learning algorithm, which exploits a new way of optimizing for sparsity. Experiments on STL-10 show that the method presents state-of-the-art performance and provides discriminative features that generalize well.

- **Summary**: Harmful contents are rising in internet day by day and this motivates the essence of more research in fast and reliable obscene and immoral material filtering. Pornographic image recognition is an important component in each filtering system. In this paper, a new approach for detecting pornographic images is introduced. In this approach, two new features are suggested. These two features in combination with other simple traditional features provide decent difference between porn and non-porn images. In addition, we applied fuzzy integral based information fusion to combine MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and NF (Neuro-Fuzzy) outputs. To test the proposed method, performance of system was evaluated over 18354 download images from internet. The attained precision was 93% in TP and 8% in FP on training dataset, and 87% and 5.5% on test dataset. Achieved results verify the performance of proposed system versus other related works.

- **Summary**: Image segmentation is the most challenging issue in computer vision applications. And most difficulties for crops management in agriculture are the lack of appropriate methods for detecting the leaf damage for pests treatment. In this paper we proposed an automatic method for leaf damage detection and severity estimation of coffee leaf by avoiding defoliation. After enhancing the contrast of the original image using LUT based gamma correction, the image is processed to remove the background, and the output leaf is clustered using Fuzzy c-means segmentation in V channel of YUV color space to maximize all leaf damage detection, and finally, the severity of leaf is estimated in terms of ratio for leaf pixel distribution between the normal and the detected leaf damage. The results in each proposed method was compared to the current researches and the accuracy is obvious either in the background removal or damage detection.

- **Summary**: Face recognition is a popular application of pat- tern recognition methods, and it faces challenging problems including illumination, expression, and pose. The most popular way is to learn the subspaces of the face images so that it could be project to another discriminant space where images of different persons can be separated. In this paper, a nearest line projection algorithm is developed to represent the face images for face recognition. Instead of projecting an image to its nearest image, we try to project it to its nearest line spanned by two different face images. The subspaces are learned so that each face image to its nearest line is minimized. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on some benchmark face image database, and also compared it to some other image projection algorithms. The experiment results showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms other ones.

- **Summary**: Since its beginning visual recognition research has tried to capture the huge variability of the visual world in several image collections. The number of available datasets is still progressively growing together with the amount of samples per object category. However, this trend does not correspond directly to an increasing in the generalization capabilities of the developed recognition systems. Each collection tends to have its specific characteristics and to cover just some aspects of the visual world: these biases often narrow the effect of the methods defined and tested separately over each image set. Our work makes a first step towards the analysis of the dataset bias problem on a large scale. We organize twelve existing databases in a unique corpus and we present the visual community with a useful feature repository for future research.

- **Summary**: A multiplierless pruned approximate 8-point discrete cosine transform (DCT) requiring only 10 additions is introduced. The proposed algorithm was assessed in image and video compression, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Digital implementation in 45 nm CMOS technology up to place-and-route level indicates clock speed of 288 MHz at a 1.1 V supply. The 8x8 block rate is 36 MHz.The DCT approximation was embedded into HEVC reference software; resulting video frames, at up to 327 Hz for 8-bit RGB HEVC, presented negligible image degradation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a method for Automatic Image Registration (AIR) through histogram is proposed. Automatic image registration is one of the crucial steps in the analysis of remotely sensed data. A new acquired image must be transformed, using image registration techniques, to match the orientation and scale of previous related images. This new approach combines several segmentations of the pair of images to be registered. A relaxation parameter on the histogram modes delineation is introduced. It is followed by characterization of the extracted objects through the objects area, axis ratio, and perimeter and fractal dimension. The matched objects are used for rotation and translation estimation. It allows for the registration of pairs of images with differences in rotation and translation. This method contributes to subpixel accuracy.

- **Summary**: It is believed that there are currently millions of vehicles on the roads worldwide. The over speed of vehicles,theft of vehicles, disobeying traffic rules in public, an unauthorized person entering the restricted area are keep on increasing. In order restrict against these criminal activities, we need an automatic public security system. Each vehicle has their own Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) as their primary identifier. The VIN is actually a License Number which states a legal license to participate in the public traffic. The proposed paper is to identify the vehicle with the help of vehicles License Plate (LP).LPRS is one the most important part of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to locate the LP. In this paper certain existing algorithm drawbacks are overcome by the proposed morphological operations for LPRS. Morphological operation is chosen due to its higher efficiency, noise filter capacity, accuracy, exact localization of LP and speed.

- **Summary**: We propose a statistical learning model for classifying cognitive processes based on distributed patterns of neural activation in the brain, acquired via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the proposed learning method, local meshes are formed around each voxel. The distance between voxels in the mesh is determined by using a functional neighbourhood concept. In order to define the functional neighbourhood, the similarities between the time series recorded for voxels are measured and functional connectivity matrices are constructed. Then, the local mesh for each voxel is formed by including the functionally closest neighbouring voxels in the mesh. The relationship between the voxels within a mesh is estimated by using a linear regression model. These relationship vectors, called Functional Connectivity aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) are then used to train a statistical learning machine. The proposed method was tested on a recognition memory experiment, including data pertaining to encoding and retrieval of words belonging to ten different semantic categories. Two popular classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are trained in order to predict the semantic category of the item being retrieved, based on activation patterns during encoding. The classification performance of the Functional Mesh Learning model, which range in 62%-71% is superior to the classical multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods, which range in 40%-48%, for ten semantic categories.

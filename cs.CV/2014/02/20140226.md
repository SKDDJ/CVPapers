- **Summary**: The use of high-dimensional features has become a normal practice in many computer vision applications. The large dimension of these features is a limiting factor upon the number of data points which may be effectively stored and processed, however. We address this problem by developing a novel approach to learning a compact binary encoding, which exploits both pair-wise proximity and class-label information on training data set. Exploiting this extra information allows the development of encodings which, although compact, outperform the original high-dimensional features in terms of final classification or retrieval performance. The method is general, in that it is applicable to both non-parametric and parametric learning methods. This generality means that the embedded features are suitable for a wide variety of computer vision tasks, such as image classification and content-based image retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that the new compact descriptor achieves an accuracy comparable to, and in some cases better than, the visual descriptor in the original space despite being significantly more compact. Moreover, any convex loss function and convex regularization penalty (e.g., $ \ell_p $ norm with $ p \ge 1 $) can be incorporated into the framework, which provides future flexibility.

- **Summary**: Rarely in literature a method of segmentation cares for the edit after the algorithm delivers. They provide no solution when segmentation goes wrong. We propose to formulate point distribution model in terms of centripetal-parameterized Catmull-Rom spline. Such fusion brings interactivity to model-based segmentation, so that edit is better handled. When the delivered segment is unsatisfactory, user simply shifts points to vary the curve. We ran the method on three disparate imaging modalities and achieved an average overlap of 0.879 for automated lung segmentation on chest radiographs. The edit afterward improved the average overlap to 0.945, with a minimum of 0.925. The source code and the demo video are available at http://wp.me/p3vCKy-2S

- **Summary**: We propose a method to recover the structure of a compound object from multiple silhouettes. Structure is expressed as a collection of 3D primitives chosen from a pre-defined library, each with an associated pose. This has several advantages over a volume or mesh representation both for estimation and the utility of the recovered model. The main challenge in recovering such a model is the combinatorial number of possible arrangements of parts. We address this issue by exploiting the sparse nature of the problem, and show that our method scales to objects constructed from large libraries of parts.

- **Summary**: There are many difficulties facing a handwritten Arabic recognition system such as unlimited variation in human handwriting, similarities of distinct character shapes, interconnections of neighbouring characters and their position in the word. The typical Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are based mainly on three stages, preprocessing, features extraction and recognition. This paper proposes new methods for handwritten Arabic character recognition which is based on novel preprocessing operations including different kinds of noise removal also different kind of features like structural, Statistical and Morphological features from the main body of the character and also from the secondary components. Evaluation of the accuracy of the selected features is made. The system was trained and tested by back propagation neural network with CENPRMI dataset. The proposed algorithm obtained promising results as it is able to recognize 88% of our test set accurately. In Comparable with other related works we find that our result is the highest among other published works.

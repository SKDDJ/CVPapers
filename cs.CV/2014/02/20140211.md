- **Summary**: We propose a novel regularization method for compressive imaging in the context of the compressed sensing (CS) theory with coherent and redundant dictionaries. Natural images are often complicated and several types of structures can be present at once. It is well known that piecewise smooth images exhibit gradient sparsity, and that images with extended structures are better encapsulated in wavelet frames. Therefore, we here conjecture that promoting average sparsity or compressibility over multiple frames rather than single frames is an extremely powerful regularization prior.

- **Summary**: Markerless motion capture is an active research in 3D virtualization. In proposed work we presented a system for markerless motion capture for 3D human character animation, paper presents a survey on motion and skeleton tracking techniques which are developed or are under development. The paper proposed a method to transform the motion of a performer to a 3D human character (model), the 3D human character performs similar movements as that of a performer in real time. In the proposed work, human model data will be captured by Kinect camera, processed data will be applied on 3D human model for animation. 3D human model is created using open source software (MakeHuman). Anticipated dataset for sport activity is considered as input which can be applied to any HCI application.

- **Summary**: In this paper we broadly consider techniques which utilize projections on rays for data collection, with particular emphasis on optical techniques. We formulate a variety of imaging techniques as either special cases or extensions of tomographic reconstruction. We then consider how the techniques must be extended to describe objects containing occlusion, as with a self-occluding opaque object. We formulate the reconstruction problem as a regularized nonlinear optimization problem to simultaneously solve for object brightness and attenuation, where the attenuation can become infinite. We demonstrate various simulated examples for imaging opaque objects, including sparse point sources, a conventional multiview reconstruction technique, and a super-resolving technique which exploits occlusion to resolve an image.

- **Summary**: We present a novel, realtime algorithm to compute the trajectory of each pedestrian in moderately dense crowd scenes. Our formulation is based on an adaptive particle filtering scheme that uses a multi-agent motion model based on velocity-obstacles, and takes into account local interactions as well as physical and personal constraints of each pedestrian. Our method dynamically changes the number of particles allocated to each pedestrian based on different confidence metrics. Additionally, we use a new high-definition crowd video dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of different pedestrian tracking algorithms. This dataset consists of videos of indoor and outdoor scenes, recorded at different locations with 30-80 pedestrians. We highlight the performance benefits of our algorithm over prior techniques using this dataset. In practice, our algorithm can compute trajectories of tens of pedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU at interactive rates (27-30 frames per second). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is 4-5 times faster than prior methods, which provide similar accuracy.

- **Summary**: Connected component analysis (CCA) has been heavily used to label binary images and classify segments. However, it has not been well-exploited to segment multi-valued natural images. This work proposes a novel multi-value segmentation algorithm that utilizes CCA to segment color images. A user defined distance measure is incorporated in the proposed modified CCA to identify and segment similar image regions. The raw output of the algorithm consists of distinctly labelled segmented regions. The proposed algorithm has a unique design architecture that provides several benefits: 1) it can be used to segment any multi-channel multi-valued image; 2) the distance measure/segmentation criteria can be application-specific and 3) an absolute linear-time implementation allows easy extension for real-time video segmentation. Experimental demonstrations of the aforesaid benefits are presented along with the comparison results on multiple datasets with current benchmark algorithms. A number of possible application areas are also identified and results on real-time video segmentation has been presented to show the promise of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The problem of hand shape classification is challenging since a hand is characterized by a large number of degrees of freedom. Numerous shape descriptors have been proposed and applied over the years to estimate and classify hand poses in reasonable time. In this paper we discuss our parallel framework for real-time hand shape classification applicable in real-time applications. We show how the number of gallery images influences the classification accuracy and execution time of the parallel algorithm. We present the speedup and efficiency analyses that prove the efficacy of the parallel implementation. Noteworthy, different methods can be used at each step of our parallel framework. Here, we combine the shape contexts with the appearance-based techniques to enhance the robustness of the algorithm and to increase the classification score. An extensive experimental study proves the superiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In Bag-of-Words (BoW) based image retrieval, the SIFT visual word has a low discriminative power, so false positive matches occur prevalently. Apart from the information loss during quantization, another cause is that the SIFT feature only describes the local gradient distribution. To address this problem, this paper proposes a coupled Multi-Index (c-MI) framework to perform feature fusion at indexing level. Basically, complementary features are coupled into a multi-dimensional inverted index. Each dimension of c-MI corresponds to one kind of feature, and the retrieval process votes for images similar in both SIFT and other feature spaces. Specifically, we exploit the fusion of local color feature into c-MI. While the precision of visual match is greatly enhanced, we adopt Multiple Assignment to improve recall. The joint cooperation of SIFT and color features significantly reduces the impact of false positive matches.   Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that c-MI improves the retrieval accuracy significantly, while consuming only half of the query time compared to the baseline. Importantly, we show that c-MI is well complementary to many prior techniques. Assembling these methods, we have obtained an mAP of 85.8% and N-S score of 3.85 on Holidays and Ukbench datasets, respectively, which compare favorably with the state-of-the-arts.

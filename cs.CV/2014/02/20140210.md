- **Summary**: We propose a foreground segmentation algorithm that does foreground extraction under different scales and refines the result by matting. First, the input image is filtered and resampled to 5 different resolutions. Then each of them is segmented by adaptive figure-ground classification and the best segmentation is automatically selected by an evaluation score that maximizes the difference between foreground and background. This segmentation is upsampled to the original size, and a corresponding trimap is built. Closed-form matting is employed to label the boundary region, and the result is refined by a final figure-ground classification. Experiments show the success of our method in treating challenging images with cluttered background and adapting to loose initial bounding-box.

- **Summary**: We present a multiple-person tracking algorithm, based on combining particle filters and RVO, an agent-based crowd model that infers collision-free velocities so as to predict pedestrian's motion. In addition to position and velocity, our tracking algorithm can estimate the internal goals (desired destination or desired velocity) of the tracked pedestrian in an online manner, thus removing the need to specify this information beforehand. Furthermore, we leverage the longer-term predictions of RVO by deriving a higher-order particle filter, which aggregates multiple predictions from different prior time steps. This yields a tracker that can recover from short-term occlusions and spurious noise in the appearance model. Experimental results show that our tracking algorithm is suitable for predicting pedestrians' behaviors online without needing scene priors or hand-annotated goal information, and improves tracking in real-world crowded scenes under low frame rates.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel binary-based cost computation and aggregation approach for stereo matching problem. The cost volume is constructed through bitwise operations on a series of binary strings. Then this approach is combined with traditional winner-take-all strategy, resulting in a new local stereo matching algorithm called binary stereo matching (BSM). Since core algorithm of BSM is based on binary and integer computations, it has a higher computational efficiency than previous methods. Experimental results on Middlebury benchmark show that BSM has comparable performance with state-of-the-art local stereo methods in terms of both quality and speed. Furthermore, experiments on images with radiometric differences demonstrate that BSM is more robust than previous methods under these changes, which is common under real illumination.

- **Summary**: The comparison of heterogeneous samples extensively exists in many applications, especially in the task of image classification. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective coupled neural network, called Deeply Coupled Autoencoder Networks (DCAN), which seeks to build two deep neural networks, coupled with each other in every corresponding layers. In DCAN, each deep structure is developed via stacking multiple discriminative coupled auto-encoders, a denoising auto-encoder trained with maximum margin criterion consisting of intra-class compactness and inter-class penalty. This single layer component makes our model simultaneously preserve the local consistency and enhance its discriminative capability. With increasing number of layers, the coupled networks can gradually narrow the gap between the two views. Extensive experiments on cross-view image classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: A new signal processing framework based on making orthogonal Projections onto the Epigraph Set of a Convex cost function (PESC) is developed. In this way it is possible to solve convex optimization problems using the well-known Projections onto Convex Set (POCS) approach. In this algorithm, the dimension of the minimization problem is lifted by one and a convex set corresponding to the epigraph of the cost function is defined. If the cost function is a convex function in $R^N$, the corresponding epigraph set is also a convex set in R^{N+1}. The PESC method provides globally optimal solutions for total-variation (TV), filtered variation (FV), L_1, L_2, and entropic cost function based convex optimization problems. In this article, the PESC based denoising and compressive sensing algorithms are developed. Simulation examples are presented.

- **Summary**: Handwritten character recognition is one of the most challenging and ongoing areas of research in the field of pattern recognition. HCR research is matured for foreign languages like Chinese and Japanese but the problem is much more complex for Indian languages. The problem becomes even more complicated for South Indian languages due to its large character set and the presence of vowels modifiers and compound characters. This paper provides an overview of important contributions and advances in offline as well as online handwritten character recognition of Malayalam scripts.

- **Summary**: The existing methods for image search reranking suffer from the unfaithfulness of the assumptions under which the text-based images search result. The resulting images contain more irrelevant images. Hence the re ranking concept arises to re rank the retrieved images based on the text around the image and data of data of image and visual feature of image. A number of methods are differentiated for this re-ranking. The high ranked images are used as noisy data and a k means algorithm for classification is learned to rectify the ranking further. We are study the affect ability of the cross validation method to this training data. The pre eminent originality of the overall method is in collecting text/metadata of image and visual features in order to achieve an automatic ranking of the images. Supervision is initiated to learn the model weights offline, previous to reranking process. While model learning needs manual labeling of the results for a some limited queries, the resulting model is query autonomous and therefore applicable to any other query .Examples are given for a selection of other classes like vehicles, animals and other classes.

- **Summary**: Bi-linear feature learning models, like the gated autoencoder, were proposed as a way to model relationships between frames in a video. By minimizing reconstruction error of one frame, given the previous frame, these models learn "mapping units" that encode the transformations inherent in a sequence, and thereby learn to encode motion. In this work we extend bi-linear models by introducing "higher-order mapping units" that allow us to encode transformations between frames and transformations between transformations.   We show that this makes it possible to encode temporal structure that is more complex and longer-range than the structure captured within standard bi-linear models. We also show that a natural way to train the model is by replacing the commonly used reconstruction objective with a prediction objective which forces the model to correctly predict the evolution of the input multiple steps into the future. Learning can be achieved by back-propagating the multi-step prediction through time. We test the model on various temporal prediction tasks, and show that higher-order mappings and predictive training both yield a significant improvement over bi-linear models in terms of prediction accuracy.

- **Summary**: Ultra low radiation dose in X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is an important clinical objective in order to minimize the risk of carcinogenesis. Compressed Sensing (CS) enables significant reductions in radiation dose to be achieved by producing diagnostic images from a limited number of CT projections. However, the excessive computation time that conventional CS-based CT reconstruction typically requires has limited clinical implementation. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a thorough analysis of CT reconstruction through a Maximum a Posteriori objective function results in a weighted compressive sensing problem. This analysis enables us to formulate a low dose fan beam and helical cone beam CT reconstruction. Subsequently, we provide an efficient solution to the formulated CS problem based on a Fast Composite Splitting Algorithm-Latent Expected Maximization (FCSA-LEM) algorithm. In the proposed method we use pseudo polar Fourier transform as the measurement matrix in order to decrease the computational complexity; and rebinning of the projections to parallel rays in order to extend its application to fan beam and helical cone beam scans. The weight involved in the proposed weighted CS model, denoted by Error Adaptation Weight (EAW), is calculated based on the statistical characteristics of CT reconstruction and is a function of Poisson measurement noise and rebinning interpolation error. Simulation results show that low computational complexity of the proposed method made the fast recovery of the CT images possible and using EAW reduces the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude. Recovery of a high quality 512$\times$ 512 image was achieved in less than 20 sec on a desktop computer without numerical optimizations.

- **Summary**: Single-sample face recognition is one of the most challenging problems in face recognition. We propose a novel algorithm to address this problem based on a sparse representation based classification (SRC) framework. The new algorithm is robust to image misalignment and pixel corruption, and is able to reduce required gallery images to one sample per class. To compensate for the missing illumination information traditionally provided by multiple gallery images, a sparse illumination learning and transfer (SILT) technique is introduced. The illumination in SILT is learned by fitting illumination examples of auxiliary face images from one or more additional subjects with a sparsely-used illumination dictionary. By enforcing a sparse representation of the query image in the illumination dictionary, the SILT can effectively recover and transfer the illumination and pose information from the alignment stage to the recognition stage. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the new algorithms significantly outperform the state of the art in the single-sample regime and with less restrictions. In particular, the single-sample face alignment accuracy is comparable to that of the well-known Deformable SRC algorithm using multiple gallery images per class. Furthermore, the face recognition accuracy exceeds those of the SRC and Extended SRC algorithms using hand labeled alignment initialization.

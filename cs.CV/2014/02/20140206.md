- **Summary**: Palmprints are emerging as a new entity in multi-modal biometrics for human identification and verification. Multispectral palmprint images captured in the visible and infrared spectrum not only contain the wrinkles and ridge structure of a palm, but also the underlying pattern of veins; making them a highly discriminating biometric identifier. In this paper, we propose a feature encoding scheme for robust and highly accurate representation and matching of multispectral palmprints. To facilitate compact storage of the feature, we design a binary hash table structure that allows for efficient matching in large databases. Comprehensive experiments for both identification and verification scenarios are performed on two public datasets -- one captured with a contact-based sensor (PolyU dataset), and the other with a contact-free sensor (CASIA dataset). Recognition results in various experimental setups show that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Error rates achieved by our method (0.003% on PolyU and 0.2% on CASIA) are the lowest reported in literature on both dataset and clearly indicate the viability of palmprint as a reliable and promising biometric. All source codes are publicly available.

- **Summary**: Nowadays digital image compression and decompression techniques are very much important. So our aim is to calculate the quality of face and other regions of the compressed image with respect to the original image. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves etc.)in images. After segmentation the image is changed into something which is more meaningful to analyze. Using Universal Image Quality Index(Q),Structural Similarity Index(SSIM) and Gradient-based Structural Similarity Index(G-SSIM) it can be shown that face region is less compressed than any other region of the image.

- **Summary**: Cellular Automata (CA) are common and most simple models of parallel computations. Edge detection is one of the crucial task in image processing, especially in processing biological and medical images. CA can be successfully applied in image processing. This paper presents a new method for edge detection of binary images based on two dimensional twenty five neighborhood cellular automata. The method considers only linear rules of CA for extraction of edges under null boundary condition. The performance of this approach is compared with some existing edge detection techniques. This comparison shows that the proposed method to be very promising for edge detection of binary images. All the algorithms and results used in this paper are prepared in MATLAB.

- **Summary**: This manuscript presents an efficient approach to map pedestrian surveillance footage to an aerial view for global assessment of features. The analysis of the footages relies on low level computer vision and enable real-time surveillance. While we neglect object tracking, we introduce cumulative grids on top view scene flow visualization to highlight situations of interest in the footage. Our approach is tested on multiview footage both from RGB cameras and, for the first time in the field, on RGB-D-sensors.

- **Summary**: In the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, an important task is to classify images of slides containing several HEp-2 cells. All cells from one slide share the same label, and by classifying cells from one slide independently, some information on the global image quality and intensity is lost. Considering one whole slide as a collection (a bag) of feature vectors, however, poses the problem of how to handle this bag. A simple, and surprisingly effective, approach is to summarize the bag of feature vectors by a few quantile values per feature. This characterizes the full distribution of all instances, thereby assuming that all instances in a bag are informative. This representation is particularly useful when each bag contains many feature vectors, which is the case in the classification of the immunofluorescence images. Experiments on the classification of indirect immunofluorescence images show the usefulness of this approach.

- **Summary**: Joint matching over a collection of objects aims at aggregating information from a large collection of similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to improve maps between pairs of them. Given multiple matches computed between a few object pairs in isolation, the goal is to recover an entire collection of maps that are (1) globally consistent, and (2) close to the provided maps --- and under certain conditions provably the ground-truth maps. Despite recent advances on this problem, the best-known recovery guarantees are limited to a small constant barrier --- none of the existing methods find theoretical support when more than $50\%$ of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover, prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically more demanding to match instances that are only partially similar to each other.   In this paper, we develop an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that exhibit only partial similarities, given a few pairwise matches that are densely corrupted. Specifically, we propose to recover the ground-truth maps via a parameter-free convex program called MatchLift, following a spectral method that pre-estimates the total number of distinct elements to be matched. Encouragingly, MatchLift exhibits near-optimal error-correction ability, i.e. in the asymptotic regime it is guaranteed to work even when a dominant fraction $1-\Theta\left(\frac{\log^{2}n}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ of the input maps behave like random outliers. Furthermore, MatchLift succeeds with minimal input complexity, namely, perfect matching can be achieved as soon as the provided maps form a connected map graph. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various benchmark data sets including synthetic examples and real-world examples, all of which confirm the practical applicability of MatchLift.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a method for tracking structures (e.g., ventricles and myocardium) in cardiac images (e.g., magnetic resonance) by propagating forward in time a previous estimate of the structures via a new deformation estimation scheme that is motivated by physical constraints of fluid motion. The method employs within structure motion estimation (so that differing motions among different structures are not mixed) while simultaneously satisfying the physical constraint in fluid motion that at the interface between a fluid and a medium, the normal component of the fluid's motion must match the normal component of the motion of the medium. We show how to estimate the motion according to the previous considerations in a variational framework, and in particular, show that these conditions lead to PDEs with boundary conditions at the interface that resemble Robin boundary conditions and induce coupling between structures. We illustrate the use of this motion estimation scheme in propagating a segmentation across frames and show that it leads to more accurate segmentation than traditional motion estimation that does not make use of physical constraints. Further, the method is naturally suited to interactive segmentation methods, which are prominently used in practice in commercial applications for cardiac analysis, where typically a segmentation from the previous frame is used to predict a segmentation in the next frame. We show that our propagation scheme reduces the amount of user interaction by predicting more accurate segmentations than commonly used and recent interactive commercial techniques.

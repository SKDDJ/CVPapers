- **Summary**: In this paper, we revisit the "FTVd" algorithm for Fast Total Variation Regularized Deconvolution, which has been widely used in the past few years. Both its original version implemented in the MATLAB software FTVd 3.0 and its related variant implemented in the latter version FTVd 4.0 are considered \cite{Wang08FTVdsoftware}. We propose that the intermediate results during the iterations are the solutions of a series of combined Tikhonov and total variation regularized image deconvolution models and therefore some of them often have even better image quality than the final solution, which is corresponding to the pure total variation regularized model.

- **Summary**: An image super-resolution method from multiple observation of low-resolution images is proposed. The method is based on sub-pixel accuracy block matching for estimating relative displacements of observed images, and sparse signal representation for estimating the corresponding high-resolution image. Relative displacements of small patches of observed low-resolution images are accurately estimated by a computationally efficient block matching method. Since the estimated displacements are also regarded as a warping component of image degradation process, the matching results are directly utilized to generate low-resolution dictionary for sparse image representation. The matching scores of the block matching are used to select a subset of low-resolution patches for reconstructing a high-resolution patch, that is, an adaptive selection of informative low-resolution images is realized. When there is only one low-resolution image, the proposed method works as a single-frame super-resolution method. The proposed method is shown to perform comparable or superior to conventional single- and multi-frame super-resolution methods through experiments using various real-world datasets.

- **Summary**: We deal with the Fourier-like analysis of functions on discrete grids in two-dimensional simplexes using $C-$ and $E-$ Weyl group orbit functions. For these cases we present the convolution theorem. We provide an example of application of image processing using the $C-$ functions and the convolutions for spatial filtering of the treated image.

- **Summary**: We study phase retrieval from magnitude measurements of an unknown signal as an algebraic estimation problem. Indeed, phase retrieval from rank-one and more general linear measurements can be treated in an algebraic way. It is verified that a certain number of generic rank-one or generic linear measurements are sufficient to enable signal reconstruction for generic signals, and slightly more generic measurements yield reconstructability for all signals. Our results solve a few open problems stated in the recent literature. Furthermore, we show how the algebraic estimation problem can be solved by a closed-form algebraic estimation technique, termed ideal regression, providing non-asymptotic success guarantees.

- **Summary**: A complete first and second order statistical characterization of noise in SENSE reconstructed data is proposed. SENSE acquisitions have usually been modeled as Rician distributed, since the data reconstruction takes place into the spatial domain, where Gaussian noise is assumed. However, this model just holds for the first order statistics and obviates other effects induced by coils correlations and the reconstruction interpolation. Those effects are properly taken into account in this study, in order to fully justify a final SENSE noise model. As a result, some interesting features of the reconstructed image arise: (1) There is a strong correlation between adjacent lines. (2) The resulting distribution is non-stationary and therefore the variance of noise will vary from point to point across the image. Closed equations for the calculation of the variance of noise and the correlation coefficient between lines are proposed. The proposed model is totally compatible with g-factor formulations.

- **Summary**: Ring theory is one of the branches of the abstract algebra that has been broadly used in images. However, ring theory has not been very related with image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a new index of similarity among images using Zn rings and the entropy function. This new index was applied as a new stopping criterion to the Mean Shift Iterative Algorithm with the goal to reach a better segmentation. An analysis on the performance of the algorithm with this new stopping criterion is carried out. The obtained results proved that the new index is a suitable tool to compare images.

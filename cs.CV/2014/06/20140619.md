- **Comment**: The approach presented in this paper (ECCV14 submission) is closely
  related to multi-stage vector quantization and residual quantization. Thanks
  the reviewers (CVPR14 and ECCV14) for pointing out the relationship to the
  two algorithms. Related paper:

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the nearest neighbor search problem under inner product similarity and introduces a compact code-based approach. The idea is to approximate a vector using the composition of several elements selected from a source dictionary and to represent this vector by a short code composed of the indices of the selected elements. The inner product between a query vector and a database vector is efficiently estimated from the query vector and the short code of the database vector. We show the superior performance of the proposed group $M$-selection algorithm that selects $M$ elements from $M$ source dictionaries for vector approximation in terms of search accuracy and efficiency for compact codes of the same length via theoretical and empirical analysis. Experimental results on large-scale datasets ($1M$ and $1B$ SIFT features, $1M$ linear models and Netflix) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: It is a well observed phenomenon that natural images are smooth, in the sense that nearby pixels tend to have similar values. We describe a mathematical model of images that makes no assumptions on the nature of the environment that images depict. It only assumes that images can be taken at different scales (zoom levels). We provide quantitative bounds on the smoothness of a typical image in our model, as a function of the number of available scales. These bounds can serve as a baseline against which to compare the observed smoothness of natural images.

- **Summary**: Outliers are the points which are different from or inconsistent with the rest of the data. They can be novel, new, abnormal, unusual or noisy information. Outliers are sometimes more interesting than the majority of the data. The main challenges of outlier detection with the increasing complexity, size and variety of datasets, are how to catch similar outliers as a group, and how to evaluate the outliers. This paper describes an approach which uses Univariate outlier detection as a pre-processing step to detect the outlier and then applies K-means algorithm hence to analyse the effects of the outliers on the cluster analysis of dataset.

- **Summary**: Robust foreground object segmentation via background modelling is a difficult problem in cluttered environments, where obtaining a clear view of the background to model is almost impossible. In this paper, we propose a method capable of robustly estimating the background and detecting regions of interest in such environments. In particular, we propose to extend the background initialisation component of a recent patch-based foreground detection algorithm with an elaborate technique based on Markov Random Fields, where the optimal labelling solution is computed using iterated conditional modes. Rather than relying purely on local temporal statistics, the proposed technique takes into account the spatial continuity of the entire background. Experiments with several tracking algorithms on the CAVIAR dataset indicate that the proposed method leads to considerable improvements in object tracking accuracy, when compared to methods based on Gaussian mixture models and feature histograms.

- **Summary**: We present convolutional neural networks for the tasks of keypoint (pose) prediction and action classification of people in unconstrained images. Our approach involves training an R-CNN detector with loss functions depending on the task being tackled. We evaluate our method on the challenging PASCAL VOC dataset and compare it to previous leading approaches. Our method gives state-of-the-art results for keypoint and action prediction. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset for action detection, the task of simultaneously localizing people and classifying their actions, and present results using our approach.

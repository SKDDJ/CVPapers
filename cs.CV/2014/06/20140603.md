- **Summary**: A novel representation of images for image retrieval is introduced in this paper, by using a new type of feature with remarkable discriminative power. Despite the multi-scale nature of objects, most existing models perform feature extraction on a fixed scale, which will inevitably degrade the performance of the whole system. Motivated by this, we introduce a hierarchical sparse coding architecture for image retrieval to explore multi-scale cues. Sparse codes extracted on lower layers are transmitted to higher layers recursively. With this mechanism, cues from different scales are fused. Experiments on the Holidays dataset show that the proposed method achieves an excellent retrieval performance with a small code length.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces an improved reranking method for the Bag-of-Words (BoW) based image search. Built on [1], a directed image graph robust to outlier distraction is proposed. In our approach, the relevance among images is encoded in the image graph, based on which the initial rank list is refined. Moreover, we show that the rank-level feature fusion can be adopted in this reranking method as well. Taking advantage of the complementary nature of various features, the reranking performance is further enhanced. Particularly, we exploit the reranking method combining the BoW and color information. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that ourmethod yields significant improvements and the reranking results are competitive to the state-of-the-art methods.

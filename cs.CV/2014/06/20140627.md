- **Summary**: The triangulation of images has become an active research area in recent years for its compressive representation and ease of image processing and visualization. However, little work has been done on how to faithfully recover image intensities from a triangulated mesh of an image, a process also known as image restoration or decoding from meshes. The existing methods such as linear interpolation, least-square interpolation, or interpolation based on radial basis functions (RBFs) work to some extent, but often yield blurred features (edges, corners, etc.). The main reason for this problem is due to the isotropically-defined Euclidean distance that is taken into consideration in these methods, without considering the anisotropicity of feature intensities in an image. Moreover, most existing methods use intensities defined at mesh nodes whose intensities are often ambiguously defined on or near image edges (or feature boundaries). In the current paper, a new method of restoring an image from its triangulation representation is proposed, by utilizing anisotropic radial basis functions (ARBFs). This method considers not only the geometrical (Euclidean) distances but also the local feature orientations (anisotropic intensities). Additionally, this method is based on the intensities of mesh faces instead of mesh nodes and thus provides a more robust restoration. The two strategies together guarantee excellent feature-preserving restoration of an image with arbitrary super-resolutions from its triangulation representation, as demonstrated by various experiments provided in the paper.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in image quality, data storage, and computational capacity have heightened the need for texture analysis in image process. To date various methods have been developed and introduced for assessing textures in images. One of the most popular texture analysis methods is the Texture Energy Measure (TEM) and it has been used for detecting edges, levels, waves, spots and ripples by employing predefined TEM masks to images. Despite several success- ful studies, TEM has a number of serious weaknesses in use. The major drawback is; the masks are predefined therefore they cannot be adapted to image. A new method, Adaptive Texture Energy Measure Method (aTEM), was offered to over- come this disadvantage of TEM by using adaptive masks by adjusting the contrast, sharpening and orientation angle of the mask. To assess the applicability of aTEM, it is compared with TEM. The accuracy of the classification of butterfly, flower seed and Brodatz datasets are 0.08, 0.3292 and 0.3343, respectively by TEM and 0.0053, 0.2417 and 0.3153, respectively by aTEM. The results of this study indicate that aTEM is a successful method for texture analysis.

- **Summary**: This article presents a novel 3D planar patch extraction method using a probabilistic region growing algorithm. Our method works by simultaneously initiating multiple planar patches from seed points, the latter determined by an intensity-based 2D segmentation algorithm in the stereo-pair images. The patches are grown incrementally and in parallel as 3D scene points are considered for membership, using a probabilistic distance likelihood measure. In addition, we have incorporated prior information based on the noise model in the 2D images and the scene configuration but also include the intensity information resulting from the initial segmentation. This method works well across many different data-sets, involving real and synthetic examples of both regularly and non-regularly sampled data, and is fast enough that may be used for robot navigation tasks of path detection and obstacle avoidance.

- **Summary**: Nonlocal filters are simple and powerful techniques for image denoising. In this paper we study the reformulation of a broad class of nonlocal filters in terms of two functional rearrangements: the decreasing and the relative rearrangements.   Independently of the dimension of the image, we reformulate these filters as integral operators defined in a one-dimensional space corresponding to the level sets measures.   We prove the equivalency between the original and the rearranged versions of the filters and propose a discretization in terms of constant-wise interpolators, which we prove to be convergent to the solution of the continuous setting.   For some particular cases, this new formulation allows us to perform a detailed analysis of the filtering properties. Among others, we prove that the filtered image is a contrast change of the original image, and that the filtering procedure behaves asymptotically as a shock filter combined with a border diffusive term, responsible for the staircaising effect and the loss of contrast.

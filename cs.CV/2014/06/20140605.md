- **Summary**: After intensive research, heterogenous face recognition is still a challenging problem. The main difficulties are owing to the complex relationship between heterogenous face image spaces. The heterogeneity is always tightly coupled with other variations, which makes the relationship of heterogenous face images highly nonlinear. Many excellent methods have been proposed to model the nonlinear relationship, but they apt to overfit to the training set, due to limited samples. Inspired by the unsupervised algorithms in deep learning, this paper proposes an novel framework for heterogeneous face recognition. We first extract Gabor features at some localized facial points, and then use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to learn a shared representation locally to remove the heterogeneity around each facial point. Finally, the shared representations of local RBMs are connected together and processed by PCA. Two problems (Sketch-Photo and NIR-VIS) and three databases are selected to evaluate the proposed method. For Sketch-Photo problem, we obtain perfect results on the CUFS database. For NIR-VIS problem, we produce new state-of-the-art performance on the CASIA HFB and NIR-VIS 2.0 databases.

- **Summary**: We propose a new variational illusory shape (VIS) model via phase fields and phase transitions. It is inspired by the first-order variational illusory contour (VIC) model proposed by Jung and Shen [{\em J. Visual Comm. Image Repres.}, {\bf 19}:42-55, 2008]. Under the new VIS model, illusory shapes are represented by phase values close to 1 while the rest by values close to 0. The 0-1 transition is achieved by an elliptic energy with a double-well potential, as in the theory of $\Gamma$-convergence. The VIS model is non-convex, with the zero field as its trivial global optimum. To seek visually meaningful local optima that can induce illusory shapes, an iterative algorithm is designed and its convergence behavior is closely studied. Several generic numerical examples confirm the versatility of the model and the algorithm.

- **Summary**: Electron Microscopy (EM) image (or volume) segmentation has become significantly important in recent years as an instrument for connectomics. This paper proposes a novel agglomerative framework for EM segmentation. In particular, given an over-segmented image or volume, we propose a novel framework for accurately clustering regions of the same neuron. Unlike existing agglomerative methods, the proposed context-aware algorithm divides superpixels (over-segmented regions) of different biological entities into different subsets and agglomerates them separately. In addition, this paper describes a "delayed" scheme for agglomerative clustering that postpones some of the merge decisions, pertaining to newly formed bodies, in order to generate a more confident boundary prediction. We report significant improvements attained by the proposed approach in segmentation accuracy over existing standard methods on 2D and 3D datasets.

- **Summary**: We describe a system that builds a high dynamic-range and wide-angle image of the night sky by combining a large set of input images. The method makes use of pixel-rank information in the individual input images to improve a "consensus" pixel rank in the combined image. Because it only makes use of ranks and the complexity of the algorithm is linear in the number of images, the method is useful for large sets of uncalibrated images that might have undergone unknown non-linear tone mapping transformations for visualization or aesthetic reasons. We apply the method to images of the night sky (of unknown provenance) discovered on the Web. The method permits discovery of astronomical objects or features that are not visible in any of the input images taken individually. More importantly, however, it permits scientific exploitation of a huge source of astronomical images that would not be available to astronomical research without our automatic system.

- **Summary**: In the current age, use of natural communication in human computer interaction is a known and well installed thought. Hand gesture recognition and gesture based applications has gained a significant amount of popularity amongst people all over the world. It has a number of applications ranging from security to entertainment. These applications generally are real time applications and need fast, accurate communication with machines. On the other end, gesture based communications have few limitations also like bent finger information is not provided in vision based techniques. In this paper, a novel method for fingertip detection and for angle calculation of both hands bent fingers is discussed. Angle calculation has been done before with sensor based gloves/devices. This study has been conducted in the context of natural computing for calculating angles without using any wired equipment, colors, marker or any device. The pre-processing and segmentation of the region of interest is performed in a HSV color space and a binary format respectively. Fingertips are detected using level-set method and angles were calculated using geometrical analysis. This technique requires no training for system to perform the task.

- **Summary**: We propose an heterogeneous multi-task learning framework for human pose estimation from monocular image with deep convolutional neural network. In particular, we simultaneously learn a pose-joint regressor and a sliding-window body-part detector in a deep network architecture. We show that including the body-part detection task helps to regularize the network, directing it to converge to a good solution. We report competitive and state-of-art results on several data sets. We also empirically show that the learned neurons in the middle layer of our network are tuned to localized body parts.

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (re-id), an emerging problem in visual surveillance, deals with maintaining entities of individuals whilst they traverse various locations surveilled by a camera network. From a visual perspective re-id is challenging due to significant changes in visual appearance of individuals in cameras with different pose, illumination and calibration. Globally the challenge arises from the need to maintain structurally consistent matches among all the individual entities across different camera views. We propose PRISM, a structured matching method to jointly account for these challenges. We view the global problem as a weighted graph matching problem and estimate edge weights by learning to predict them based on the co-occurrences of visual patterns in the training examples. These co-occurrence based scores in turn account for appearance changes by inferring likely and unlikely visual co-occurrences appearing in training instances. We implement PRISM on single shot and multi-shot scenarios. PRISM uniformly outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of matching rate while being computationally efficient.

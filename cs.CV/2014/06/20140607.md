- **Summary**: Holistic methods based on dense trajectories are currently the de facto standard for recognition of human activities in video. Whether holistic representations will sustain or will be superseded by higher level video encoding in terms of body pose and motion is the subject of an ongoing debate. In this paper we aim to clarify the underlying factors responsible for good performance of holistic and pose-based representations. To that end we build on our recent dataset leveraging the existing taxonomy of human activities. This dataset includes 24,920 video snippets covering 410 human activities in total. Our analysis reveals that holistic and pose-based methods are highly complementary, and their performance varies significantly depending on the activity. We find that holistic methods are mostly affected by the number and speed of trajectories, whereas pose-based methods are mostly influenced by viewpoint of the person. We observe striking performance differences across activities: for certain activities results with pose-based features are more than twice as accurate compared to holistic features, and vice versa. The best performing approach in our comparison is based on the combination of holistic and pose-based approaches, which again underlines their complementarity.

- **Summary**: In this contribution, a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm for (medical) image analysis is presented. More precise, the approach belongs to the category of interactive contouring algorithms, which provide real-time feedback of the segmentation result. However, even with interactive real-time contouring approaches there are always cases where the user cannot find a satisfying segmentation, e.g. due to homogeneous appearances between the object and the background, or noise inside the object. For these difficult cases the algorithm still needs additional user support. However, this additional user support should be intuitive and rapid integrated into the segmentation process, without breaking the interactive real-time segmentation feedback. I propose a solution where the user can support the algorithm by an easy and fast placement of one or more seed points to guide the algorithm to a satisfying segmentation result also in difficult cases. These additional seed(s) restrict(s) the calculation of the segmentation for the algorithm, but at the same time, still enable to continue with the interactive real-time feedback segmentation. For a practical and genuine application in translational science, the approach has been tested on medical data from the clinical routine in 2D and 3D.

- **Summary**: Shape-from-X is an important class of problems in the fields of geometry processing, computer graphics, and vision, attempting to recover the structure of a shape from some observations. In this paper, we formulate the problem of shape-from-operator (SfO), recovering an embedding of a mesh from intrinsic differential operators defined on the mesh. Particularly interesting instances of our SfO problem include synthesis of shape analogies, shape-from-Laplacian reconstruction, and shape exaggeration. Numerically, we approach the SfO problem by splitting it into two optimization sub-problems that are applied in an alternating scheme: metric-from-operator (reconstruction of the discrete metric from the intrinsic operator) and embedding-from-metric (finding a shape embedding that would realize a given metric, a setting of the multidimensional scaling problem).

- **Summary**: Recent trends in image understanding have pushed for holistic scene understanding models that jointly reason about various tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, shape analysis, contextual reasoning, and local appearance based classifiers. In this work, we are interested in understanding the roles of these different tasks in improved scene understanding, in particular semantic segmentation, object detection and scene recognition. Towards this goal, we "plug-in" human subjects for each of the various components in a state-of-the-art conditional random field model. Comparisons among various hybrid human-machine CRFs give us indications of how much "head room" there is to improve scene understanding by focusing research efforts on various individual tasks.

- **Summary**: Retrieving similar images from a large dataset based on the image content has been a very active research area and is a very challenging task. Studies have shown that retrieving similar images based on their shape is a very effective method. For this purpose a large number of methods exist in literature. The combination of more than one feature has also been investigated for this purpose and has shown promising results. In this paper a fusion based shapes recognition method has been proposed. A set of local boundary based and region based features are derived from the labeled grid based representation of the shape and are combined with a few global shape features to produce a composite shape descriptor. This composite shape descriptor is then used in a weighted ranking algorithm to find similarities among shapes from a large dataset. The experimental analysis has shown that the proposed method is powerful enough to discriminate the geometrically similar shapes from the non-similar ones.

- **Summary**: Multi-task feature learning aims to identity the shared features among tasks to improve generalization. It has been shown that by minimizing non-convex learning models, a better solution than the convex alternatives can be obtained. Therefore, a non-convex model based on the capped-$\ell_{1},\ell_{1}$ regularization was proposed in \cite{Gong2013}, and a corresponding efficient multi-stage multi-task feature learning algorithm (MSMTFL) was presented. However, this algorithm harnesses a prescribed fixed threshold in the definition of the capped-$\ell_{1},\ell_{1}$ regularization and the lack of adaptivity might result in suboptimal performance. In this paper we propose to employ an adaptive threshold in the capped-$\ell_{1},\ell_{1}$ regularized formulation, where the corresponding variant of MSMTFL will incorporate an additional component to adaptively determine the threshold value. This variant is expected to achieve a better feature selection performance over the original MSMTFL algorithm. In particular, the embedded adaptive threshold component comes from our previously proposed iterative support detection (ISD) method \cite{Wang2010}. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of this new variant over the original MSMTFL.

- **Summary**: Soft Clustering plays a very important rule on clustering real world data where a data item contributes to more than one cluster. Fuzzy logic based algorithms are always suitable for performing soft clustering tasks. Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm is a very popular fuzzy logic based algorithm. In case of fuzzy logic based algorithm, the parameter like exponent for the partition matrix that we have to fix for the clustering task plays a very important rule on the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, an experimental analysis is done on FCM algorithm to observe the impact of this parameter on the performance of the algorithm.



### Semantic Graph for Zero-Shot Learning

- **Summary**: Zero-shot learning aims to classify visual objects without any training data via knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. This is typically achieved by exploring a semantic embedding space where the seen and unseen classes can be related. Previous works differ in what embedding space is used and how different classes and a test image can be related. In this paper, we utilize the annotation-free semantic word space for the former and focus on solving the latter issue of modeling relatedness. Specifically, in contrast to previous work which ignores the semantic relationships between seen classes and focus merely on those between seen and unseen classes, in this paper a novel approach based on a semantic graph is proposed to represent the relationships between all the seen and unseen class in a semantic word space. Based on this semantic graph, we design a special absorbing Markov chain process, in which each unseen class is viewed as an absorbing state. After incorporating one test image into the semantic graph, the absorbing probabilities from the test data to each unseen class can be effectively computed; and zero-shot classification can be achieved by finding the class label with the highest absorbing probability. The proposed model has a closed-form solution which is linear with respect to the number of test images. We demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts on the AwA (animals with attributes) dataset.

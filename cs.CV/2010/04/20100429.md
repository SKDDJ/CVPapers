- **Summary**: This work reveals an experimental microscopy acquisition scheme successfully combining Compressed Sensing (CS) and digital holography in off-axis and frequency-shifting conditions. CS is a recent data acquisition theory involving signal reconstruction from randomly undersampled measurements, exploiting the fact that most images present some compact structure and redundancy. We propose a genuine CS-based imaging scheme for sparse gradient images, acquiring a diffraction map of the optical field with holographic microscopy and recovering the signal from as little as 7% of random measurements. We report experimental results demonstrating how CS can lead to an elegant and effective way to reconstruct images, opening the door for new microscopy applications.

- **Summary**: We explore the practicability of Nash's Embedding Theorem in vision and imaging sciences. In particular, we investigate the relevance of a result of Burago and Zalgaller regarding the existence of isometric embeddings of polyhedral surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and we show that their proof does not extended directly to higher dimensions.

- **Summary**: In this paper an accurate real-time sequence-based system for representation, recognition, interpretation, and analysis of the facial action units (AUs) and expressions is presented. Our system has the following characteristics: 1) employing adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and temporal information, we developed a classification scheme based on neuro-fuzzy modeling of the AU intensity, which is robust to intensity variations, 2) using both geometric and appearance-based features, and applying efficient dimension reduction techniques, our system is robust to illumination changes and it can represent the subtle changes as well as temporal information involved in formation of the facial expressions, and 3) by continuous values of intensity and employing top-down hierarchical rule-based classifiers, we can develop accurate human-interpretable AU-to-expression converters. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade database show the superiority of the proposed method, in comparison with support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and neural network classifiers. Keywords: biased discriminant analysis (BDA), classifier design and evaluation, facial action units (AUs), hybrid learning, neuro-fuzzy modeling.

- **Summary**: Facial Action Coding System consists of 44 action units (AUs) and more than 7000 combinations. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) classifier has been used successfully to recognize facial action units (AUs) and expressions due to its ability to deal with AU dynamics. However, a separate HMM is necessary for each single AU and each AU combination. Since combinations of AU numbering in thousands, a more efficient method will be needed. In this paper an accurate real-time sequence-based system for representation and recognition of facial AUs is presented. Our system has the following characteristics: 1) employing a mixture of HMMs and neural network, we develop a novel accurate classifier, which can deal with AU dynamics, recognize subtle changes, and it is also robust to intensity variations, 2) although we use an HMM for each single AU only, by employing a neural network we can recognize each single and combination AU, and 3) using both geometric and appearance-based features, and applying efficient dimension reduction techniques, our system is robust to illumination changes and it can represent the temporal information involved in formation of the facial expressions. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade database show the superiority of the proposed method, in comparison with other classifiers. Keywords: classifier design and evaluation, data fusion, facial action units (AUs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), neural network (NN).

- **Summary**: In this paper a novel efficient method for representation of facial action units by encoding an image sequence as a fourth-order tensor is presented. The multilinear tensor-based extension of the biased discriminant analysis (BDA) algorithm, called multilinear biased discriminant analysis (MBDA), is first proposed. Then, we apply the MBDA and two-dimensional BDA (2DBDA) algorithms, as the dimensionality reduction techniques, to Gabor representations and the geometric features of the input image sequence respectively. The proposed scheme can deal with the asymmetry between positive and negative samples as well as curse of dimensionality dilemma. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade database show the superiority of the proposed method for representation of the subtle changes and the temporal information involved in formation of the facial expressions. As an accurate tool, this representation can be applied to many areas such as recognition of spontaneous and deliberate facial expressions, multi modal/media human computer interaction and lie detection efforts.

- **Summary**: Contour tracking in adverse environments is a challenging problem due to cluttered background, illumination variation, occlusion, and noise, among others. This paper presents a robust contour tracking method by contributing to some of the key issues involved, including (a) a region functional formulation and its optimization; (b) design of a robust and effective feature; and (c) development of an integrated tracking algorithm. First, we formulate a region functional based on robust Earth Mover's distance (EMD) with kernel density for distribution modeling, and propose a two-phase method for its optimization. In the first phase, letting the candidate contour be fixed, we express EMD as the transportation problem and solve it by the simplex algorithm. Next, using the theory of shape derivative, we make a perturbation analysis of the contour around the best solution to the transportation problem. This leads to a partial differential equation (PDE) that governs the contour evolution. Second, we design a novel and effective feature for tracking applications. We propose a dimensionality reduction method by tensor decomposition, achieving a low-dimensional description of SIFT features called Tensor-SIFT for characterizing local image region properties. Applicable to both color and gray-level images, Tensor-SIFT is very distinctive, insensitive to illumination changes, and noise. Finally, we develop an integrated algorithm that combines various techniques of the simplex algorithm, narrow-band level set and fast marching algorithms. Particularly, we introduce an inter-frame initialization method and a stopping criterion for the termination of PDE iteration. Experiments in challenging image sequences show that the proposed work has promising performance.

- **Summary**: Classification is one of the most important tasks of machine learning. Although the most well studied model is the two-class problem, in many scenarios there is the opportunity to label critical items for manual revision, instead of trying to automatically classify every item. In this paper we adapt a paradigm initially proposed for the classification of ordinal data to address the classification problem with reject option. The technique reduces the problem of classifying with reject option to the standard two-class problem. The introduced method is then mapped into support vector machines and neural networks. Finally, the framework is extended to multiclass ordinal data with reject option. An experimental study with synthetic and real data sets, verifies the usefulness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: The Peirce quincuncial projection is a mapping of the surface of a sphere to the interior of a square. It is a conformal map except for four points on the equator. These points of non-conformality cause significant artifacts in photographic applications. In this paper, we propose an algorithm and user-interface to mitigate these artifacts. Moreover, in order to facilitate an interactive user-interface, we present a fast algorithm for calculating the Peirce quincuncial projection of spherical imagery. We then promote the Peirce quincuncial projection as a viable alternative to the more popular stereographic projection in some scenarios.

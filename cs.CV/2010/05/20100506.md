- **Summary**: The use of OCR in postal services is not yet universal and there are still many countries that process mail sorting manually. Automated Arabic/Indian numeral Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for Postal services are being used in some countries, but still there are errors during the mail sorting process, thus causing a reduction in efficiency. The need to investigate fast and efficient recognition algorithms/systems is important so as to correctly read the postal codes from mail addresses and to eliminate any errors during the mail sorting stage. The objective of this study is to recognize printed numerical postal codes from mail addresses. The proposed system is a multistage hybrid system which consists of three different feature extraction methods, i.e., binary, zoning, and fuzzy features, and three different classifiers, i.e., Hamming Nets, Euclidean Distance, and Fuzzy Neural Network Classifiers. The proposed system, systematically compares the performance of each of these methods, and ensures that the numerals are recognized correctly. Comprehensive results provide a very high recognition rate, outperforming the other known developed methods in literature.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an efficient human recognition system based on vein pattern from the palma dorsa. A new absorption based technique has been proposed to collect good quality images with the help of a low cost camera and light source. The system automatically detects the region of interest from the image and does the necessary preprocessing to extract features. A Euclidean Distance based matching technique has been used for making the decision. It has been tested on a data set of 1750 image samples collected from 341 individuals. The accuracy of the verification system is found to be 99.26% with false rejection rate (FRR) of 0.03%.

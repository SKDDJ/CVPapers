- **Summary**: This paper attempts to undertake the study of segmentation image techniques by using five threshold methods as Mean method, P-tile method, Histogram Dependent Technique (HDT), Edge Maximization Technique (EMT) and visual Technique and they are compared with one another so as to choose the best technique for threshold segmentation techniques image. These techniques applied on three satellite images to choose base guesses for threshold segmentation image.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present an OCR for Handwritten Devnagari Characters. Basic symbols are recognized by neural classifier. We have used four feature extraction techniques namely, intersection, shadow feature, chain code histogram and straight line fitting features. Shadow features are computed globally for character image while intersection features, chain code histogram features and line fitting features are computed by dividing the character image into different segments. Weighted majority voting technique is used for combining the classification decision obtained from four Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) based classifier. On experimentation with a dataset of 4900 samples the overall recognition rate observed is 92.80% as we considered top five choices results. This method is compared with other recent methods for Handwritten Devnagari Character Recognition and it has been observed that this approach has better success rate than other methods.

- **Summary**: This paper aims at generating a new face based on the human like description using a new concept. The FASY (FAce SYnthesis) System is a Face Database Retrieval and new Face generation System that is under development. One of its main features is the generation of the requested face when it is not found in the existing database, which allows a continuous growing of the database also.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach to handle the challenges of face recognition. In this work thermal face images are considered, which minimizes the affect of illumination changes and occlusion due to moustache, beards, adornments etc. The proposed approach registers the training and testing thermal face images in polar coordinate, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Polar images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark thermal face images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 97.05%.

- **Summary**: In this paper we describe a procedure to reduce the size of the input feature vector. A complex pattern recognition problem like face recognition involves huge dimension of input feature vector. To reduce that dimension here we have used eigenspace projection (also called as Principal Component Analysis), which is basically transformation of space. To reduce further we have applied feature selection method to select indispensable features, which will remain in the final feature vectors. Features those are not selected are removed from the final feature vector considering them as redundant or superfluous. For selection of features we have used the concept of reduct and core from rough set theory. This method has shown very good performance. It is worth to mention that in some cases the recognition rate increases with the decrease in the feature vector dimension.

- **Summary**: Euclidean norm calculations arise frequently in scientific and engineering applications. Several approximations for this norm with differing complexity and accuracy have been proposed in the literature. Earlier approaches were based on minimizing the maximum error. Recently, Seol and Cheun proposed an approximation based on minimizing the average error. In this paper, we first examine these approximations in detail, show that they fit into a single mathematical formulation, and compare their average and maximum errors. We then show that the maximum errors given by Seol and Cheun are significantly optimistic.

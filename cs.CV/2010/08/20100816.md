- **Summary**: The famous Perona-Malik (P-M) equation which was at first introduced for image restoration has been solved via various numerical methods. In this paper we will solve it for the first time via applying a new numerical method called Homotopy Perturbation Method (HMP) and the correspondent approximated solutions will be obtained for the P-M equation with regards to relevant error analysis. Through implementation of our algorithm we will access some effective results which are deserved to be considered as worthy as the other solutions issued by the other methods.

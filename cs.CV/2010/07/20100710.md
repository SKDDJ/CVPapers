- **Summary**: Template matching is one of the simplest methods used for eyes and mouth detection. However, it can be modified and extended to become a powerful tool. Since the patch itself plays a significant role in optimizing detection performance, a study on the influence of patch size and shape is carried out. The optimum patch size and shape is determined using the proposed method. Usually, template matching is also combined with other methods in order to improve detection accuracy. Thus, in this paper, the effectiveness of two image processing methods i.e. grayscale and Haar wavelet transform, when used with template matching are analyzed.

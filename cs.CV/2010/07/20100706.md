- **Summary**: Nonlinear bilateral filters (BF) deliver a fine blend of computational simplicity and blur-free denoising. However, little is known about their nature, noise-suppressing properties, and optimal choices of filter parameters. Our study is meant to fill this gap-explaining the underlying mechanism of bilateral filtering and providing the methodology for optimal filter selection. Practical application to CT image denoising is discussed to illustrate our results.

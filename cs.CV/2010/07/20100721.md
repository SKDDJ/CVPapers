- **Summary**: This paper proposes a robust ear identification system which is developed by fusing SIFT features of color segmented slice regions of an ear. The proposed ear identification method makes use of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to build ear model with mixture of Gaussian using vector quantization algorithm and K-L divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of reference ear and probe ear. SIFT features are then detected and extracted from each color slice region as a part of invariant feature extraction. The extracted keypoints are then fused separately by the two fusion approaches, namely concatenation and the Dempster-Shafer theory. Finally, the fusion approaches generate two independent augmented feature vectors which are used for identification of individuals separately. The proposed identification technique is tested on IIT Kanpur ear database of 400 individuals and is found to achieve 98.25% accuracy for identification while top 5 matched criteria is set for each subject.

- **Summary**: L1-minimization refers to finding the minimum L1-norm solution to an underdetermined linear system b=Ax. Under certain conditions as described in compressive sensing theory, the minimum L1-norm solution is also the sparsest solution. In this paper, our study addresses the speed and scalability of its algorithms. In particular, we focus on the numerical implementation of a sparsity-based classification framework in robust face recognition, where sparse representation is sought to recover human identities from very high-dimensional facial images that may be corrupted by illumination, facial disguise, and pose variation. Although the underlying numerical problem is a linear program, traditional algorithms are known to suffer poor scalability for large-scale applications. We investigate a new solution based on a classical convex optimization framework, known as Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM). The new convex solvers provide a viable solution to real-world, time-critical applications such as face recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to validate and compare the performance of the ALM algorithms against several popular L1-minimization solvers, including interior-point method, Homotopy, FISTA, SESOP-PCD, approximate message passing (AMP) and TFOCS. To aid peer evaluation, the code for all the algorithms has been made publicly available.

- **Summary**: VERSA provides a general-purpose framework for defining and recognizing events in live or recorded surveillance video streams. The approach for event recognition in VERSA is using a declarative logic language to define the spatial and temporal relationships that characterize a given event or activity. Doing so requires the definition of certain fundamental spatial and temporal relationships and a high-level syntax for specifying frame templates and query parameters. Although the handling of uncertainty in the current VERSA implementation is simplistic, the language and architecture is amenable to extending using Fuzzy Logic or similar approaches. VERSA's high-level architecture is designed to work in XML-based, services- oriented environments. VERSA can be thought of as subscribing to the XML annotations streamed by a lower-level video analytics service that provides basic entity detection, labeling, and tracking. One or many VERSA Event Monitors could thus analyze video streams and provide alerts when certain events are detected.

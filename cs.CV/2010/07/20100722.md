- **Summary**: In this paper orthogonal multifilters for astronomical image processing are presented. We obtained new orthogonal multifilters based on the orthogonal wavelet of Haar and Daubechies. Recently, multiwavelets have been introduced as a more powerful multiscale analysis tool. It adds several degrees of freedom in multifilter design and makes it possible to have several useful properties such as symmetry, orthogonality, short support, and a higher number of vanishing moments simultaneously. Multifilter decomposition of scanned photographic plates with astronomical images is made.

- **Summary**: Many techniques have been proposed to speedup the performance of classic Hough Transform. These techniques are primarily based on converting the voting procedure to a hierarchy based voting method. These methods use approximate decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a fast decision making process that enhances the speed and reduces the space requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is much faster than a similar Fast Hough Transform.

- **Summary**: This paper aims at determining the characteristics of a face image by extracting its components. The FASY (FAce SYnthesis) System is a Face Database Retrieval and new Face generation System that is under development. One of its main features is the generation of the requested face when it is not found in the existing database, which allows a continuous growing of the database also. To generate the new face image, we need to store the face components in the database. So we have designed a new technique to extract the face components by a sophisticated method. After extraction of the facial feature points we have analyzed the components to determine their characteristics. After extraction and analysis we have stored the components along with their characteristics into the face database for later use during the face construction.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the multiresolution level-1 and level-2 Quotient based Fusion of thermal and visual images. In the proposed system, the method-1 namely "Decompose then Quotient Fuse Level-1" and the method-2 namely "Decompose-Reconstruct then Quotient Fuse Level-2" both work on wavelet transformations of the visual and thermal face images. The wavelet transform is well-suited to manage different image resolution and allows the image decomposition in different kinds of coefficients, while preserving the image information without any loss. This approach is based on a definition of an illumination invariant signature image which enables an analytic generation of the image space with varying illumination. The quotient fused images are passed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and then those images are classified using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The performances of both the methods have been evaluated using OTCBVS and IRIS databases. All the different classes have been tested separately, among them the maximum recognition result is 100%.

- **Summary**: In this paper fusion of visual and thermal images in wavelet transformed domain has been presented. Here, Daubechies wavelet transform, called as D2, coefficients from visual and corresponding coefficients computed in the same manner from thermal images are combined to get fused coefficients. After decomposition up to fifth level (Level 5) fusion of coefficients is done. Inverse Daubechies wavelet transform of those coefficients gives us fused face images. The main advantage of using wavelet transform is that it is well-suited to manage different image resolution and allows the image decomposition in different kinds of coefficients, while preserving the image information. Fused images thus found are passed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for reduction of dimensions and then those reduced fused images are classified using a multi-layer perceptron. For experiments IRIS Thermal/Visual Face Database was used. Experimental results show that the performance of the approach presented here achieves maximum success rate of 100% in many cases.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a comparative study on fusion of visual and thermal images using different wavelet transformations. Here, coefficients of discrete wavelet transforms from both visual and thermal images are computed separately and combined. Next, inverse discrete wavelet transformation is taken in order to obtain fused face image. Both Haar and Daubechies (db2) wavelet transforms have been used to compare recognition results. For experiments IRIS Thermal/Visual Face Database was used. Experimental results using Haar and Daubechies wavelets show that the performance of the approach presented here achieves maximum success rate of 100% in many cases.

- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks have already shown their success in face recognition and similar complex pattern recognition tasks. However, a major disadvantage of the technique is that it is extremely slow during training for larger classes and hence not suitable for real-time complex problems such as pattern recognition. This is an attempt to develop a parallel framework for the training algorithm of a perceptron. In this paper, two general architectures for a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been demonstrated. The first architecture is All-Class-in-One-Network (ACON) where all the classes are placed in a single network and the second one is One-Class-in-One-Network (OCON) where an individual single network is responsible for each and every class. Capabilities of these two architectures were compared and verified in solving human face recognition, which is a complex pattern recognition task where several factors affect the recognition performance like pose variations, facial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination changes. Both the structures were implemented and tested for face recognition purpose and experimental results show that the OCON structure performs better than the generally used ACON ones in term of training convergence speed of the network. Unlike the conventional sequential approach of training the neural networks, the OCON technique may be implemented by training all the classes of the face images simultaneously.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a technique for fusion of optical and thermal face images based on image pixel fusion approach. Out of several factors, which affect face recognition performance in case of visual images, illumination changes are a significant factor that needs to be addressed. Thermal images are better in handling illumination conditions but not very consistent in capturing texture details of the faces. Other factors like sunglasses, beard, moustache etc also play active role in adding complicacies to the recognition process. Fusion of thermal and visual images is a solution to overcome the drawbacks present in the individual thermal and visual face images. Here fused images are projected into an eigenspace and the projected images are classified using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network and also by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In the experiments Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark for thermal and visual face images have been used. Comparison of experimental results show that the proposed approach performs significantly well in recognizing face images with a success rate of 96% and 95.07% for RBF Neural Network and MLP respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a concept of image pixel fusion of visual and thermal faces, which can significantly improve the overall performance of a face recognition system. Several factors affect face recognition performance including pose variations, facial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination changes. So, image pixel fusion of thermal and visual images is a solution to overcome the drawbacks present in the individual thermal and visual face images. Fused images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark thermal and visual face images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 95.07%. The main objective of employing fusion is to produce a fused image that provides the most detailed and reliable information. Fusion of multiple images together produces a more efficient representation of the image.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a simple novel approach to tackle the challenges of scaling and rotation of face images in face recognition. The proposed approach registers the training and testing visual face images by log-polar transformation, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Log-polar images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using an improved multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used ORL face database and Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database for visual face images. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the recognition performances from visual to log-polar-visual face images. In case of ORL face database, recognition rate for visual face images is 89.5% and that is increased to 97.5% for log-polar-visual face images whereas for OTCBVS face database recognition rate for visual images is 87.84% and 96.36% for log-polar-visual face images.

- **Summary**: In this work we investigate a novel approach to handle the challenges of face recognition, which includes rotation, scale, occlusion, illumination etc. Here, we have used thermal face images as those are capable to minimize the affect of illumination changes and occlusion due to moustache, beards, adornments etc. The proposed approach registers the training and testing thermal face images in polar coordinate, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Line features are extracted from thermal polar images and feature vectors are constructed using these line. Feature vectors thus obtained passes through principal component analysis (PCA) for the dimensionality reduction of feature vectors. Finally, the images projected into eigenspace are classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 99.25%.

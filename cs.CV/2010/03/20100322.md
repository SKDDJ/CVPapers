- **Summary**: Principle objective of Image enhancement is to process an image so that result is more suitable than original image for specific application. Digital image enhancement techniques provide a multitude of choices for improving the visual quality of images. Appropriate choice of such techniques is greatly influenced by the imaging modality, task at hand and viewing conditions. This paper will provide an overview of underlying concepts, along with algorithms commonly used for image enhancement. The paper focuses on spatial domain techniques for image enhancement, with particular reference to point processing methods and histogram processing.

- **Summary**: Area of classifying satellite imagery has become a challenging task in current era where there is tremendous growth in settlement i.e. construction of buildings, roads, bridges, dam etc. This paper suggests an improvised k-means and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier for land-cover mapping of Eastern Himalayan state Sikkim. The improvised k-means algorithm shows satisfactory results compared to existing methods that includes k-Nearest Neighbor and maximum likelihood classifier. The strength of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier lies in the fact that they are fast and have good recognition rate and it's capability of self-learning compared to other classification algorithms has made it widely accepted. Classifier based on ANN shows satisfactory and accurate result in comparison with the classical method.

- **Summary**: High-throughput screening (HTS) using model organisms is a promising method to identify a small number of genes or drugs potentially relevant to human biology or disease. In HTS experiments, robots and computers do a significant portion of the experimental work. However, one remaining major bottleneck is the manual analysis of experimental results, which is commonly in the form of microscopy images. This manual inspection is labor intensive, slow and subjective. Here we report our progress towards applying computer vision and machine learning methods to analyze HTS experiments that use Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worms grown on agar. Our main contribution is a robust segmentation algorithm for separating the worms from the background using brightfield images. We also show that by combining the output of this segmentation algorithm with an algorithm to detect the fluorescent dye, Nile Red, we can reliably distinguish different fluorescence-based phenotypes even though the visual differences are subtle. The accuracy of our method is similar to that of expert human analysts. This new capability is a significant step towards fully automated HTS experiments using C. elegans.

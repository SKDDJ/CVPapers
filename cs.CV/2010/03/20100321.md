- **Summary**: Among the many ways to model signals, a recent approach that draws considerable attention is sparse representation modeling. In this model, the signal is assumed to be generated as a random linear combination of a few atoms from a pre-specified dictionary. In this work we analyze two Bayesian denoising algorithms -- the Maximum-Aposteriori Probability (MAP) and the Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error (MMSE) estimators, under the assumption that the dictionary is unitary. It is well known that both these estimators lead to a scalar shrinkage on the transformed coefficients, albeit with a different response curve. In this work we start by deriving closed-form expressions for these shrinkage curves and then analyze their performance. Upper bounds on the MAP and the MMSE estimation errors are derived. We tie these to the error obtained by a so-called oracle estimator, where the support is given, establishing a worst-case gain-factor between the MAP/MMSE estimation errors and the oracle's performance. These denoising algorithms are demonstrated on synthetic signals and on true data (images).

- **Summary**: Linear inverse problems are very common in signal and image processing. Many algorithms that aim at solving such problems include unknown parameters that need tuning. In this work we focus on optimally selecting such parameters in iterative shrinkage methods for image deblurring and image zooming. Our work uses the projected Generalized Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE) for determining the threshold value lambda and the iterations number K in these algorithms. The proposed parameter selection is shown to handle any degradation operator, including ill-posed and even rectangular ones. This is achieved by using GSURE on the projected expected error. We further propose an efficient greedy parameter setting scheme, that tunes the parameter while iterating without impairing the resulting deblurring performance. Finally, we provide extensive comparisons to conventional methods for parameter selection, showing the superiority of the use of the projected GSURE.

- **Summary**: Interest point detection is a common task in various computer vision applications. Although a big variety of detector are developed so far computational efficiency of interest point based image analysis remains to be the problem. Current paper proposes a system-theoretic approach to interest point detection. Starting from the analysis of interdependency between detector and descriptor it is shown that given a descriptor it is possible to introduce to notion of detector redundancy. Furthermore for each detector it is possible to construct its irredundant and equivalent modification. Modified detector possesses lower computational complexity and is preferable. It is also shown that several known approaches to reduce computational complexity of image registration can be generalized in terms of proposed theory.

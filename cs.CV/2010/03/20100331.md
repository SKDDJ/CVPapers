- **Summary**: Integrated Traffic Management Systems (ITMS) are now implemented in different cities in India to primarily address the concerns of road-safety and security. An automated Red Light Violation Detection System (RLVDS) is an integral part of the ITMS. In our present work we have designed and developed a complete system for generating the list of all stop-line violating vehicle images automatically from video snapshots of road-side surveillance cameras. The system first generates adaptive background images for each camera view, subtracts captured images from the corresponding background images and analyses potential occlusions over the stop-line in a traffic signal. Considering round-the-clock operations in a real-life test environment, the developed system could successfully track 92% images of vehicles with violations on the stop-line in a "Red" traffic signal.

- **Summary**: Automatic License Plate Recognition system is a challenging area of research now-a-days and binarization is an integral and most important part of it. In case of a real life scenario, most of existing methods fail to properly binarize the image of a vehicle in a congested road, captured through a CCD camera. In the current work we have applied histogram equalization technique over the complete image and also over different hierarchy of image partitioning. A novel scheme is formulated for giving the membership value to each pixel for each hierarchy of histogram equalization. Then the image is binarized depending on the net membership value of each pixel. The technique is exhaustively evaluated on the vehicle image dataset as well as the license plate dataset, giving satisfactory performances.

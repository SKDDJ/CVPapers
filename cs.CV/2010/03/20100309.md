- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new technique based on nonlinear Adaptive Median filter (AMF) for image restoration. Image denoising is a common procedure in digital image processing aiming at the removal of noise, which may corrupt an image during its acquisition or transmission, while retaining its quality. This procedure is traditionally performed in the spatial or frequency domain by filtering. The aim of image enhancement is to reconstruct the true image from the corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to degradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the original image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter is the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of smoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is the one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small neighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high noise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Median (CWM) filter has got a better average performance over the median filter [8]. However the original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high noise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach by overcoming the existing problem, the proposed new scheme (AMF) Adaptive Median Filter has been simulated along with the standard ones and various performance measures have been compared.

- **Summary**: Augmenting human computer interaction with automated analysis and synthesis of facial expressions is a goal towards which much research effort has been devoted recently. Facial gesture recognition is one of the important component of natural human-machine interfaces; it may also be used in behavioural science, security systems and in clinical practice. Although humans recognise facial expressions virtually without effort or delay, reliable expression recognition by machine is still a challenge. The face expression recognition problem is challenging because different individuals display the same expression differently. This paper presents an overview of gesture recognition in real time using the concepts of correlation and Mahalanobis distance.We consider the six universal emotional categories namely joy, anger, fear, disgust, sadness and surprise.

- **Summary**: Image denoising is getting more significance, especially in Computed Tomography (CT), which is an important and most common modality in medical imaging. This is mainly due to that the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis using CT image lies on the image quality. The denoising technique for CT images using window-based Multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding shows the effectiveness in denoising, however, a drawback exists in selecting the closer windows in the process of window-based multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding. Generally, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are closer to each window of original noisy image are obtained by the checking them sequentially. This leads to the possibility of missing out very closer windows and so enhancement is required in the aforesaid process of the denoising technique. In this paper, we propose a GA-based window selection methodology to include the denoising technique. With the aid of the GA-based window selection methodology, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are very closer to every window of the original noisy image are extracted in an effective manner. By incorporating the proposed GA-based window selection methodology, the denoising the CT image is performed effectively. Eventually, a comparison is made between the denoising technique with and without the proposed GA-based window selection methodology.

- **Summary**: Digital image plays a vital role in the early detection of cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, lungs cancer, cervical cancer. Ultrasound imaging method is also suitable for early detection of the abnormality of fetus. The accurate detection of region of interest in ultrasound image is crucial. Since the result of reflection, refraction and deflection of ultrasound waves from different types of tissues with different acoustic impedance. Usually, the contrast in ultrasound image is very low and weak edges make the image difficult to identify the fetus region in the ultrasound image. So the analysis of ultrasound image is more challenging one. We try to develop a new algorithmic approach to solve the problem of non clarity and find disorder of it. Generally there is no common enhancement approach for noise reduction. This paper proposes different filtering techniques based on statistical methods for the removal of various noise. The quality of the enhanced images is measured by the statistical quantity measures: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

- **Summary**: Handwritten numeral recognition is in general a benchmark problem of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence. Compared to the problem of printed numeral recognition, the problem of handwritten numeral recognition is compounded due to variations in shapes and sizes of handwritten characters. Considering all these, the problem of handwritten numeral recognition is addressed under the present work in respect to handwritten Arabic numerals. Arabic is spoken throughout the Arab World and the fifth most popular language in the world slightly before Portuguese and Bengali. For the present work, we have developed a feature set of 88 features is designed to represent samples of handwritten Arabic numerals for this work. It includes 72 shadow and 16 octant features. A Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier is used here for recognition handwritten Arabic digits represented with the said feature set. On experimentation with a database of 3000 samples, the technique yields an average recognition rate of 94.93% evaluated after three-fold cross validation of results. It is useful for applications related to OCR of handwritten Arabic Digit and can also be extended to include OCR of handwritten characters of Arabic alphabet.

- **Summary**: The work presents a comparative assessment of seven different feature sets for recognition of handwritten Arabic numerals using a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier. The seven feature sets employed here consist of shadow features, octant centroids, longest runs, angular distances, effective spans, dynamic centers of gravity, and some of their combinations. On experimentation with a database of 3000 samples, the maximum recognition rate of 95.80% is observed with both of two separate combinations of features. One of these combinations consists of shadow and centriod features, i. e. 88 features in all, and the other shadow, centroid and longest run features, i. e. 124 features in all. Out of these two, the former combination having a smaller number of features is finally considered effective for applications related to Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of handwritten Arabic numerals. The work can also be extended to include OCR of handwritten characters of Arabic alphabet.

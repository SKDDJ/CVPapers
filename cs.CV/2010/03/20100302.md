- **Summary**: For many machine learning algorithms such as $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) classifiers and $ k $-means clustering, often their success heavily depends on the metric used to calculate distances between different data points.   An effective solution for defining such a metric is to learn it from a set of labeled training samples. In this work, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric. By employing the principle of margin maximization to achieve better generalization performances, this algorithm formulates the metric learning as a convex optimization problem and a positive semidefinite (psd) matrix is the unknown variable. a specialized gradient descent method is proposed. our algorithm is much more efficient and has a better performance in scalability compared with existing methods. Experiments on benchmark data sets suggest that, compared with state-of-the-art metric learning algorithms, our algorithm can achieve a comparable classification accuracy with reduced computational complexity.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a unified algorithmic framework for solving many known variants of \mds. Our algorithm is a simple iterative scheme with guaranteed convergence, and is \emph{modular}; by changing the internals of a single subroutine in the algorithm, we can switch cost functions and target spaces easily. In addition to the formal guarantees of convergence, our algorithms are accurate; in most cases, they converge to better quality solutions than existing methods, in comparable time. We expect that this framework will be useful for a number of \mds variants that have not yet been studied.   Our framework extends to embedding high-dimensional points lying on a sphere to points on a lower dimensional sphere, preserving geodesic distances. As a compliment to this result, we also extend the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma to this spherical setting, where projecting to a random $O((1/\eps^2) \log n)$-dimensional sphere causes $\eps$-distortion.

- **Summary**: Designing a Business Card Reader (BCR) for mobile devices is a challenge to the researchers because of huge deformation in acquired images, multiplicity in nature of the business cards and most importantly the computational constraints of the mobile devices. This paper presents a text extraction method designed in our work towards developing a BCR for mobile devices. At first, the background of a camera captured image is eliminated at a coarse level. Then, various rule based techniques are applied on the Connected Components (CC) to filter out the noises and picture regions. The CCs identified as text are then binarized using an adaptive but light-weight binarization technique. Experiments show that the text extraction accuracy is around 98% for a wide range of resolutions with varying computation time and memory requirements. The optimum performance is achieved for the images of resolution 1024x768 pixels with text extraction accuracy of 98.54% and, space and time requirements as 1.1 MB and 0.16 seconds respectively.

- **Summary**: Business card images are of multiple natures as these often contain graphics, pictures and texts of various fonts and sizes both in background and foreground. So, the conventional binarization techniques designed for document images can not be directly applied on mobile devices. In this paper, we have presented a fast binarization technique for camera captured business card images. A card image is split into small blocks. Some of these blocks are classified as part of the background based on intensity variance. Then the non-text regions are eliminated and the text ones are skew corrected and binarized using a simple yet adaptive technique. Experiment shows that the technique is fast, efficient and applicable for the mobile devices.

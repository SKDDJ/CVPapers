- **Summary**: The Coherence Length Diagram and the related maps have been shown to represent a useful tool for image analysis. Setting threshold parameters is one of the most important issues when dealing with such applications, as they affect both the computability, which is outlined by the support map, and the appearance of the coherence length diagram itself and of defect maps. A coupled optimization analysis, returning a range for the basic (saturation) threshold, and a histogram based method, yielding suitable values for a desired map appearance, are proposed for an effective control of the analysis process.

- **Summary**: This paper presents multi-appearance fusion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and generalization of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for multi-camera view offline face recognition (verification) system. The generalization of LDA has been extended to establish correlations between the face classes in the transformed representation and this is called canonical covariate. The proposed system uses Gabor filter banks for characterization of facial features by spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation to make compensate to the variations of face instances occurred due to illumination, pose and facial expression changes. Convolution of Gabor filter bank to face images produces Gabor face representations with high dimensional feature vectors. PCA and canonical covariate are then applied on the Gabor face representations to reduce the high dimensional feature spaces into low dimensional Gabor eigenfaces and Gabor canonical faces. Reduced eigenface vector and canonical face vector are fused together using weighted mean fusion rule. Finally, support vector machines (SVM) have trained with augmented fused set of features and perform the recognition task. The system has been evaluated with UMIST face database consisting of multiview faces. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed system for multi-view face images with high recognition rates. Complexity analysis of the proposed system is also presented at the end of the experimental results.

- **Summary**: This paper uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to fuse multiple classifiers for an offline signature system. From the signature images, global and local features are extracted and the signatures are verified with the help of Gaussian empirical rule, Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance based classifiers. SVM is used to fuse matching scores of these matchers. Finally, recognition of query signatures is done by comparing it with all signatures of the database. The proposed system is tested on a signature database contains 5400 offline signatures of 600 individuals and the results are found to be promising.

- **Summary**: The objective of the paper is to recognize handwritten samples of lower case Roman script using Tesseract open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine under Apache License 2.0. Handwritten data samples containing isolated and free-flow text were collected from different users. Tesseract is trained with user-specific data samples of both the categories of document pages to generate separate user-models representing a unique language-set. Each such language-set recognizes isolated and free-flow handwritten test samples collected from the designated user. On a three user model, the system is trained with 1844, 1535 and 1113 isolated handwritten character samples collected from three different users and the performance is tested on 1133, 1186 and 1204 character samples, collected form the test sets of the three users respectively. The user specific character level accuracies were obtained as 87.92%, 81.53% and 65.71% respectively. The overall character-level accuracy of the system is observed as 78.39%. The system fails to segment 10.96% characters and erroneously classifies 10.65% characters on the overall dataset.

- **Summary**: Objective of the current work is to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine for information Just In Time (iJIT) system that can be used for recognition of handwritten textual annotations of lower case Roman script. Tesseract open source OCR engine under Apache License 2.0 is used to develop user-specific handwriting recognition models, viz., the language sets, for the said system, where each user is identified by a unique identification tag associated with the digital pen. To generate the language set for any user, Tesseract is trained with labeled handwritten data samples of isolated and free-flow texts of Roman script, collected exclusively from that user. The designed system is tested on five different language sets with free- flow handwritten annotations as test samples. The system could successfully segment and subsequently recognize 87.92%, 81.53%, 92.88%, 86.75% and 90.80% handwritten characters in the test samples of five different users.

- **Summary**: The objective of the paper is to recognize handwritten samples of basic Bangla characters using Tesseract open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine under Apache License 2.0. Handwritten data samples containing isolated Bangla basic characters and digits were collected from different users. Tesseract is trained with user-specific data samples of document pages to generate separate user-models representing a unique language-set. Each such language-set recognizes isolated basic Bangla handwritten test samples collected from the designated users. On a three user model, the system is trained with 919, 928 and 648 isolated handwritten character and digit samples and the performance is tested on 1527, 14116 and 1279 character and digit samples, collected form the test datasets of the three users respectively. The user specific character/digit recognition accuracies were obtained as 90.66%, 91.66% and 96.87% respectively. The overall basic character-level and digit level accuracy of the system is observed as 92.15% and 97.37%. The system fails to segment 12.33% characters and 15.96% digits and also erroneously classifies 7.85% characters and 2.63% on the overall dataset.

- **Summary**: The objective of the paper is to recognize handwritten samples of Roman numerals using Tesseract open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. Tesseract is trained with data samples of different persons to generate one user-independent language model, representing the handwritten Roman digit-set. The system is trained with 1226 digit samples collected form the different users. The performance is tested on two different datasets, one consisting of samples collected from the known users (those who prepared the training data samples) and the other consisting of handwritten data samples of unknown users. The overall recognition accuracy is obtained as 92.1% and 86.59% on these test datasets respectively.

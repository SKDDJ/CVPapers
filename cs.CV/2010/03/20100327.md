- **Summary**: We provide a novel search technique, which uses a hierarchical model and a mutual information gain heuristic to efficiently prune the search space when localizing faces in images. We show exponential gains in computation over traditional sliding window approaches, while keeping similar performance levels.

- **Summary**: Fast evolution of Internet technologies has led to an explosive growth of video data available in the public domain and created unprecedented challenges in the analysis, organization, management, and control of such content. The problems encountered in video analysis such as identifying a video in a large database (e.g. detecting pirated content in YouTube), putting together video fragments, finding similarities and common ancestry between different versions of a video, have analogous counterpart problems in genetic research and analysis of DNA and protein sequences. In this paper, we exploit the analogy between genetic sequences and videos and propose an approach to video analysis motivated by genomic research. Representing video information as video DNA sequences and applying bioinformatic algorithms allows to search, match, and compare videos in large-scale databases. We show an application for content-based metadata mapping between versions of annotated video.

- **Summary**: This paper shows how a folded Markov chain network can be applied to the problem of processing data from multiple sensors, with an emphasis on the special case of 2 sensors. It is necessary to design the network so that it can transform a high dimensional input vector into a posterior probability, for which purpose the partitioned mixture distribution network is ideally suited. The underlying theory is presented in detail, and a simple numerical simulation is given that shows the emergence of ocular dominance stripes.

- **Summary**: Rendering techniques based on a random grid can be improved by adapting brushstrokes to the shape of different areas of the original picture. In this paper, the concept of Coherence Length Diagram is applied to determine the adaptive brushstrokes, in order to simulate an impressionist painting. Some examples are provided to instance the proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: Estimating intrinsic dimensionality of data is a classic problem in pattern recognition and statistics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool in discovering dimensionality of data sets with a linear structure; it, however, becomes ineffective when data have a nonlinear structure. In this paper, we propose a new PCA-based method to estimate intrinsic dimension of data with nonlinear structures. Our method works by first finding a minimal cover of the data set, then performing PCA locally on each subset in the cover and finally giving the estimation result by checking up the data variance on all small neighborhood regions. The proposed method utilizes the whole data set to estimate its intrinsic dimension and is convenient for incremental learning. In addition, our new PCA procedure can filter out noise in data and converge to a stable estimation with the neighborhood region size increasing. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Microcalcifications in mammogram have been mainly targeted as a reliable earliest sign of breast cancer and their early detection is vital to improve its prognosis. Since their size is very small and may be easily overlooked by the examining radiologist, computer-based detection output can assist the radiologist to improve the diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm for detecting microcalcification in mammogram. The proposed microcalcification detection algorithm involves mammogram quality enhancement using multirresolution analysis based on the dyadic wavelet transform and microcalcification detection by fuzzy shell clustering. It may be possible to detect nodular components such as microcalcification accurately by introducing shape information. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for microcalcification detection is confirmed by experimental results.

- **Summary**: A method for the design of Fast Haar wavelet for signal processing and image processing has been proposed. In the proposed work, the analysis bank and synthesis bank of Haar wavelet is modified by using polyphase structure. Finally, the Fast Haar wavelet was designed and it satisfies alias free and perfect reconstruction condition. Computational time and computational complexity is reduced in Fast Haar wavelet transform.

- **Summary**: A Human Computer Interface (HCI) System for playing games is designed here for more natural communication with the machines. The system presented here is a vision-based system for detection of long voluntary eye blinks and interpretation of blink patterns for communication between man and machine. This system replaces the mouse with the human face as a new way to interact with the computer. Facial features (nose tip and eyes) are detected and tracked in realtime to use their actions as mouse events. The coordinates and movement of the nose tip in the live video feed are translated to become the coordinates and movement of the mouse pointer on the application. The left or right eye blinks fire left or right mouse click events. The system works with inexpensive USB cameras and runs at a frame rate of 30 frames per second.

- **Summary**: Faces are highly deformable objects which may easily change their appearance over time. Not all face areas are subject to the same variability. Therefore decoupling the information from independent areas of the face is of paramount importance to improve the robustness of any face recognition technique. This paper presents a robust face recognition technique based on the extraction and matching of SIFT features related to independent face areas. Both a global and local (as recognition from parts) matching strategy is proposed. The local strategy is based on matching individual salient facial SIFT features as connected to facial landmarks such as the eyes and the mouth. As for the global matching strategy, all SIFT features are combined together to form a single feature. In order to reduce the identification errors, the Dempster-Shafer decision theory is applied to fuse the two matching techniques. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with the ORL and the IITK face databases. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed face recognition techniques also in the case of partially occluded faces or with missing information.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an efficient technique for partitioning large biometric database during identification. In this technique feature vector which comprises of global and local descriptors extracted from offline signature are used by fuzzy clustering technique to partition the database. As biometric features posses no natural order of sorting, thus it is difficult to index them alphabetically or numerically. Hence, some supervised criteria is required to partition the search space. At the time of identification the fuzziness criterion is introduced to find the nearest clusters for declaring the identity of query sample. The system is tested using bin-miss rate and performs better in comparison to traditional k-means approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new face identification system based on Graph Matching Technique on SIFT features extracted from face images. Although SIFT features have been successfully used for general object detection and recognition, only recently they were applied to face recognition. This paper further investigates the performance of identification techniques based on Graph matching topology drawn on SIFT features which are invariant to rotation, scaling and translation. Face projections on images, represented by a graph, can be matched onto new images by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial distortions and the similarities of the local features. Two graph based matching techniques have been investigated to deal with false pair assignment and reducing the number of features to find the optimal feature set between database and query face SIFT features. The experimental results, performed on the BANCA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for automatic face identification.

- **Summary**: Ear biometric is considered as one of the most reliable and invariant biometrics characteristics in line with iris and fingerprint characteristics. In many cases, ear biometrics can be compared with face biometrics regarding many physiological and texture characteristics. In this paper, a robust and efficient ear recognition system is presented, which uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) as feature descriptor for structural representation of ear images. In order to make it more robust to user authentication, only the regions having color probabilities in a certain ranges are considered for invariant SIFT feature extraction, where the K-L divergence is used for keeping color consistency. Ear skin color model is formed by Gaussian mixture model and clustering the ear color pattern using vector quantization. Finally, K-L divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of reference model and probe ear images. After segmentation of ear images in some color slice regions, SIFT keypoints are extracted and an augmented vector of extracted SIFT features are created for matching, which is accomplished between a pair of reference model and probe ear images. The proposed technique has been tested on the IITK Ear database and the experimental results show improvements in recognition accuracy while invariant features are extracted from color slice regions to maintain the robustness of the system.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a multimodal biometric system of fingerprint and ear biometrics. Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor based feature sets extracted from fingerprint and ear are fused. The fused set is encoded by K-medoids partitioning approach with less number of feature points in the set. K-medoids partition the whole dataset into clusters to minimize the error between data points belonging to the clusters and its center. Reduced feature set is used to match between two biometric sets. Matching scores are generated using wolf-lamb user-dependent feature weighting scheme introduced by Doddington. The technique is tested to exhibit its robust performance.

- **Summary**: This paper uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to fuse multiple classifiers for an offline signature system. From the signature images, global and local features are extracted and the signatures are verified with the help of Gaussian empirical rule, Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance based classifiers. SVM is used to fuse matching scores of these matchers. Finally, recognition of query signatures is done by comparing it with all signatures of the database. The proposed system is tested on a signature database contains 5400 offline signatures of 600 individuals and the results are found to be promising.

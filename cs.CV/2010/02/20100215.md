- **Summary**: Relationships that exist between the classical, Shannon-type, and geometric-based approaches to sampling are investigated. Some aspects of coding and communication through a Gaussian channel are considered. In particular, a constructive method to determine the quantizing dimension in Zador's theorem is provided. A geometric version of Shannon's Second Theorem is introduced. Applications to Pulse Code Modulation and Vector Quantization of Images are addressed.

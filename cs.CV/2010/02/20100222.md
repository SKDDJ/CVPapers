- **Summary**: A novel approach for recognition of handwritten compound Bangla characters, along with the Basic characters of Bangla alphabet, is presented here. Compared to English like Roman script, one of the major stumbling blocks in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of handwritten Bangla script is the large number of complex shaped character classes of Bangla alphabet. In addition to 50 basic character classes, there are nearly 160 complex shaped compound character classes in Bangla alphabet. Dealing with such a large varieties of handwritten characters with a suitably designed feature set is a challenging problem. Uncertainty and imprecision are inherent in handwritten script. Moreover, such a large varieties of complex shaped characters, some of which have close resemblance, makes the problem of OCR of handwritten Bangla characters more difficult. Considering the complexity of the problem, the present approach makes an attempt to identify compound character classes from most frequently to less frequently occurred ones, i.e., in order of importance. This is to develop a frame work for incrementally increasing the number of learned classes of compound characters from more frequently occurred ones to less frequently occurred ones along with Basic characters. On experimentation, the technique is observed produce an average recognition rate of 79.25 after three fold cross validation of data with future scope of improvement and extension.

- **Summary**: Nowadays government and private agencies use remote sensing imagery for a wide range of applications from military applications to farm development. The images may be a panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral or even ultraspectral of terra bytes. Remote sensing image classification is one amongst the most significant application worlds for remote sensing. A few number of image classification algorithms have proved good precision in classifying remote sensing data. But, of late, due to the increasing spatiotemporal dimensions of the remote sensing data, traditional classification algorithms have exposed weaknesses necessitating further research in the field of remote sensing image classification. So an efficient classifier is needed to classify the remote sensing images to extract information. We are experimenting with both supervised and unsupervised classification. Here we compare the different classification methods and their performances. It is found that Mahalanobis classifier performed the best in our classification.

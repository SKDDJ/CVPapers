- **Summary**: Accurately detecting pedestrians in images plays a critically important role in many computer vision applications. Extraction of effective features is the key to this task. Promising features should be discriminative, robust to various variations and easy to compute. In this work, we present novel features, termed dense center-symmetric local binary patterns (CS-LBP) and pyramid center-symmetric local binary/ternary patterns (CS-LBP/LTP), for pedestrian detection. The standard LBP proposed by Ojala et al. \cite{c4} mainly captures the texture information. The proposed CS-LBP feature, in contrast, captures the gradient information and some texture information. Moreover, the proposed dense CS-LBP and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP are easy to implement and computationally efficient, which is desirable for real-time applications. Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense CS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and the start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection kernel SVMs. We also demonstrate that the combination of our pyramid CS-LBP feature and the PHOG feature could significantly improve the detection performance-producing state-of-the-art accuracy on the INRIA pedestrian dataset.

- **Summary**: Reduced ordering based vector filters have proved successful in removing long-tailed noise from color images while preserving edges and fine image details. These filters commonly utilize variants of the Minkowski distance to order the color vectors with the aim of distinguishing between noisy and noise-free vectors. In this paper, we review various alternative distance measures and evaluate their performance on a large and diverse set of images using several effectiveness and efficiency criteria. The results demonstrate that there are in fact strong alternatives to the popular Minkowski metrics.

- **Summary**: Vector filters based on order-statistics have proved successful in removing impulsive noise from color images while preserving edges and fine image details. Among these filters, the ones that involve the cosine distance function (directional filters) have particularly high computational requirements, which limits their use in time critical applications. In this paper, we introduce two methods to speed up these filters. Experiments on a diverse set of color images show that the proposed methods provide substantial computational gains without significant loss of accuracy.

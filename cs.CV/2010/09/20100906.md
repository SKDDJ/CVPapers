- **Summary**: Vector operators based on robust order statistics have proved successful in digital multichannel imaging applications, particularly color image filtering and enhancement, in dealing with impulsive noise while preserving edges and fine image details. These operators often have very high computational requirements which limits their use in time-critical applications. This paper introduces techniques to speed up vector filters using the minimax approximation theory. Extensive experiments on a large and diverse set of color images show that proposed approximations achieve an excellent balance among ease of implementation, accuracy, and computational speed.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a fast switching filter for impulsive noise removal from color images. The filter exploits the HSL color space, and is based on the peer group concept, which allows for the fast detection of noise in a neighborhood without resorting to pairwise distance computations between each pixel. Experiments on large set of diverse images demonstrate that the proposed approach is not only extremely fast, but also gives excellent results in comparison to various state-of-the-art filters.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a comprehensive survey of 48 filters for impulsive noise removal from color images is presented. The filters are formulated using a uniform notation and categorized into 8 families. The performance of these filters is compared on a large set of images that cover a variety of domains using three effectiveness and one efficiency criteria. In order to ensure a fair efficiency comparison, a fast and accurate approximation for the inverse cosine function is introduced. In addition, commonly used distance measures (Minkowski, angular, and directional-distance) are analyzed and evaluated. Finally, suggestions are provided on how to choose a filter given certain requirements.

- **Summary**: Dermoscopy is a non-invasive skin imaging technique, which permits visualization of features of pigmented melanocytic neoplasms that are not discernable by examination with the naked eye. One of the most important features for the diagnosis of melanoma in dermoscopy images is the blue-white veil (irregular, structureless areas of confluent blue pigmentation with an overlying white "ground-glass" film). In this article, we present a machine learning approach to the detection of blue-white veil and related structures in dermoscopy images. The method involves contextual pixel classification using a decision tree classifier. The percentage of blue-white areas detected in a lesion combined with a simple shape descriptor yielded a sensitivity of 69.35% and a specificity of 89.97% on a set of 545 dermoscopy images. The sensitivity rises to 78.20% for detection of blue veil in those cases where it is a primary feature for melanoma recognition.

- **Summary**: Background: Dermoscopy is one of the major imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, dermoscopy image analysis has become an important research area. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders. Although numerous methods have been developed for the detection of lesion borders, very few studies were comprehensive in the evaluation of their results. Methods: In this paper, we evaluate five recent border detection methods on a set of 90 dermoscopy images using three sets of dermatologist-drawn borders as the ground-truth. In contrast to previous work, we utilize an objective measure, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand Index, which takes into account the variations in the ground-truth images. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the differences between four of the evaluated border detection methods are in fact smaller than those predicted by the commonly used XOR measure.

- **Summary**: Background: Dermoscopy is one of the major imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, automated analysis of dermoscopy images has become an important research area. Border detection is often the first step in this analysis. Methods: In this article, we present an approximate lesion localization method that serves as a preprocessing step for detecting borders in dermoscopy images. In this method, first the black frame around the image is removed using an iterative algorithm. The approximate location of the lesion is then determined using an ensemble of thresholding algorithms. Results: The method is tested on a set of 428 dermoscopy images. The localization error is quantified by a metric that uses dermatologist determined borders as the ground truth. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the method presented here achieves both fast and accurate localization of lesions in dermoscopy images.

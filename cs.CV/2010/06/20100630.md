- **Summary**: Classification methods based on learning from examples have been widely applied to character recognition from the 1990s and have brought forth significant improvements of recognition accuracies. This class of methods includes statistical methods, artificial neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), multiple classifier combination, etc. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of the some classification methods that have been successfully applied to handwritten Devnagari character recognition and results of SVM and ANNs classification method, applied on Handwritten Devnagari characters. After preprocessing the character image, we extracted shadow features, chain code histogram features, view based features and longest run features. These features are then fed to Neural classifier and in support vector machine for classification. In neural classifier, we explored three ways of combining decisions of four MLP's designed for four different features.

- **Summary**: This paper deals with a new method for recognition of offline Handwritten non-compound Devnagari Characters in two stages. It uses two well known and established pattern recognition techniques: one using neural networks and the other one using minimum edit distance. Each of these techniques is applied on different sets of characters for recognition. In the first stage, two sets of features are computed and two classifiers are applied to get higher recognition accuracy. Two MLP's are used separately to recognize the characters. For one of the MLP's the characters are represented with their shadow features and for the other chain code histogram feature is used. The decision of both MLP's is combined using weighted majority scheme. Top three results produced by combined MLP's in the first stage are used to calculate the relative difference values. In the second stage, based on these relative differences character set is divided into two. First set consists of the characters with distinct shapes and second set consists of confused characters, which appear very similar in shapes. Characters of distinct shapes of first set are classified using MLP. Confused characters in second set are classified using minimum edit distance method. Method of minimum edit distance makes use of corner detected in a character image using modified Harris corner detection technique. Experiment on this method is carried out on a database of 7154 samples. The overall recognition is found to be 90.74%.

- **Summary**: In this paper a scheme for offline Handwritten Devnagari Character Recognition is proposed, which uses different feature extraction methodologies and recognition algorithms. The proposed system assumes no constraints in writing style or size. First the character is preprocessed and features namely : Chain code histogram and moment invariant features are extracted and fed to Multilayer Perceptrons as a preliminary recognition step. Finally the results of both MLP's are combined using weighted majority scheme. The proposed system is tested on 1500 handwritten devnagari character database collected from different people. It is observed that the proposed system achieves recognition rates 98.03% for top 5 results and 89.46% for top 1 result.

- **Summary**: This work presents the application of weighted majority voting technique for combination of classification decision obtained from three Multi_Layer Perceptron(MLP) based classifiers for Recognition of Handwritten Devnagari characters using three different feature sets. The features used are intersection, shadow feature and chain code histogram features. Shadow features are computed globally for character image while intersection features and chain code histogram features are computed by dividing the character image into different segments. On experimentation with a dataset of 4900 samples the overall recognition rate observed is 92.16% as we considered top five choices results. This method is compared with other recent methods for Handwritten Devnagari Character Recognition and it has been observed that this approach has better success rate than other methods.

- **Summary**: The paper presents a two stage classification approach for handwritten devanagari characters The first stage is using structural properties like shirorekha, spine in character and second stage exploits some intersection features of characters which are fed to a feedforward neural network. Simple histogram based method does not work for finding shirorekha, vertical bar (Spine) in handwritten devnagari characters. So we designed a differential distance based technique to find a near straight line for shirorekha and spine. This approach has been tested for 50000 samples and we got 89.12% success

- **Summary**: In this paper a method for recognition of handwritten devanagari characters is described. Here, feature vector is constituted by accumulated directional gradient changes in different segments, number of intersections points for the character, type of spine present and type of shirorekha present in the character. One Multi-layer Perceptron with conjugate-gradient training is used to classify these feature vectors. This method is applied to a database with 1000 sample characters and the recognition rate obtained is 88.12%

- **Summary**: A novel, generic scheme for off-line handwritten English alphabets character images is proposed. The advantage of the technique is that it can be applied in a generic manner to different applications and is expected to perform better in uncertain and noisy environments. The recognition scheme is using a multilayer perceptron(MLP) neural networks. The system was trained and tested on a database of 300 samples of handwritten characters. For improved generalization and to avoid overtraining, the whole available dataset has been divided into two subsets: training set and test set. We achieved 99.10% and 94.15% correct recognition rates on training and test sets respectively. The purposed scheme is robust with respect to various writing styles and size as well as presence of considerable noise.

- **Summary**: This paper aims at VLSI realization for generation of a new face from textual description. The FASY (FAce SYnthesis) System is a Face Database Retrieval and new Face generation System that is under development. One of its main features is the generation of the requested face when it is not found in the existing database. The new face generation system works in three steps - searching phase, assembling phase and tuning phase. In this paper the tuning phase using hardware description language and its implementation in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device is presented.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel type-2 Fuzzy logic System to define the Shape of a facial component with the crisp output. This work is the part of our main research effort to design a system (called FASY) which offers a novel face construction approach based on the textual description and also extracts and analyzes the facial components from a face image by an efficient technique. The Fuzzy model, designed in this paper, takes crisp value of width and height of a facial component and produces the crisp value of Shape for different facial components. This method is designed using Matlab 6.5 and Visual Basic 6.0 and tested with the facial components extracted from 200 male and female face images of different ages from different face databases.

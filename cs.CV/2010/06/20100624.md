- **Summary**: A denoising technique based on noise invalidation is proposed. The adaptive approach derives a noise signature from the noise order statistics and utilizes the signature to denoise the data. The novelty of this approach is in presenting a general-purpose denoising in the sense that it does not need to employ any particular assumption on the structure of the noise-free signal, such as data smoothness or sparsity of the coefficients. An advantage of the method is in denoising the corrupted data in any complete basis transformation (orthogonal or non-orthogonal). Experimental results show that the proposed method, called Noise Invalidation Denoising (NIDe), outperforms existing denoising approaches in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE).

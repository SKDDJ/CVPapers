- **Summary**: The Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager is an instrument, specially designed for investigation of the wave processes in the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere. In order to determine the kinematics parameters of a wave, the values of a physical quantity in different space points and their changes in the time should be known. An approach for image processing of registered spectrograms is proposed. A detailed description is made of the steps of this approach, related to recovering CCD pixel values, influenced by cosmic particles, dark image correction and filter parameters determination.

- **Summary**: The Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager is an instrument, specially designed for investigation of the wave processes in the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere. In order to determine the kinematic parameters of a wave, the values of a physical quantity in different space points and their changes in the time should be known. As a result of the possibilities of the SATI instrument for space scanning, different parts of the images (sectors of spectrograms) correspond to the respective mesopause areas (where the radiation is generated). Algorithms for sector spectra calculation are proposed. In contrast to the original algorithms where twelve sectors with angles of 30 degrees are only determined now sectors with arbitrary orientation and angles are calculated. An algorithm is presented for sector calculation based on pixel division into sub pixels. A comparative results are shown.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a survey of human action recognition approaches based on visual data recorded from a single video camera. We propose an organizing framework which puts in evidence the evolution of the area, with techniques moving from heavily constrained motion capture scenarios towards more challenging, realistic, "in the wild" videos. The proposed organization is based on the representation used as input for the recognition task, emphasizing the hypothesis assumed and thus, the constraints imposed on the type of video that each technique is able to address. Expliciting the hypothesis and constraints makes the framework particularly useful to select a method, given an application. Another advantage of the proposed organization is that it allows categorizing newest approaches seamlessly with traditional ones, while providing an insightful perspective of the evolution of the action recognition task up to now. That perspective is the basis for the discussion in the end of the paper, where we also present the main open issues in the area.

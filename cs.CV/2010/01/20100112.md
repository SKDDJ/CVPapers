- **Summary**: Among all biometric, dorsal hand vein pattern is attracting the attention of researchers, of late. Extensive research is being carried out on various techniques in the hope of finding an efficient one which can be applied on dorsal hand vein pattern to improve its accuracy and matching time. One of the crucial step in biometric is the extraction of features. In this paper, we propose a method based on quadratic inference function to the dorsal hand vein features to extract its features. The biometric system developed was tested on a database of 100 images. The false acceptance rate (FAR), false rejection rate (FRR) and the matching time are being computed.

- **Summary**: The need of sign language is increasing radically especially to hearing impaired community. Only few research groups try to automatically recognize sign language from video, colored gloves and etc. Their approach requires a valid segmentation of the data that is used for training and of the data that is used to be recognized. Recognition of a sign language image sequence is challenging because of the variety of hand shapes and hand motions. Here, this paper proposes to apply a combination of image segmentation with restoration using topological derivatives for achieving high recognition accuracy. Image quality measures are conceded here to differentiate the methods both subjectively as well as objectively. Experiments show that the additional use of the restoration before segmenting the postures significantly improves the correct rate of hand detection, and that the discrete derivatives yields a high rate of discrimination between different static hand postures as well as between hand postures and the scene background. Eventually, the research is to contribute to the implementation of automated sign language recognition system mainly established for the welfare purpose.

- **Summary**: In this paper, A new image steganography scheme is proposed which is a kind of spatial domain technique. In order to hide secret data in cover-image, the first component alteration technique is used. Techniques used so far focuses only on the two or four bits of a pixel in a image (at the most five bits at the edge of an image) which results in less peak to signal noise ratio and high root mean square error. In this technique, 8 bits of blue components of pixels are replaced with secret data bits. Proposed scheme can embed more data than previous schemes and shows better image quality. To prove this scheme, several experiments are performed, and are compared the experimental results with the related previous works.

- **Summary**: An improved image mining technique for brain tumor classification using pruned association rule with MARI algorithm is presented in this paper. The method proposed makes use of association rule mining technique to classify the CT scan brain images into three categories namely normal, benign and malign. It combines the low level features extracted from images and high level knowledge from specialists. The developed algorithm can assist the physicians for efficient classification with multiple keywords per image to improve the accuracy. The experimental result on prediagnosed database of brain images showed 96 percent and 93 percent sensitivity and accuracy respectively.

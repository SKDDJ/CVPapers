- **Summary**: As the Internet help us cross cultural border by providing different information, plagiarism issue is bound to arise. As a result, plagiarism detection becomes more demanding in overcoming this issue. Different plagiarism detection tools have been developed based on various detection techniques. Nowadays, fingerprint matching technique plays an important role in those detection tools. However, in handling some large content articles, there are some weaknesses in fingerprint matching technique especially in space and time consumption issue. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect plagiarism which integrates the use of fingerprint matching technique with four key features to assist in the detection process. These proposed features are capable to choose the main point or key sentence in the articles to be compared. Those selected sentence will be undergo the fingerprint matching process in order to detect the similarity between the sentences. Hence, time and space usage for the comparison process is reduced without affecting the effectiveness of the plagiarism detection.

- **Summary**: Biometrics has become a "hot" area. Governments are funding research programs focused on biometrics. In this paper the problem of person recognition and verification based on a different biometric application has been addressed. The system is based on the 3DSkull recognition using 3D matching technique, in fact this paper present several bio-metric approaches in order of assign the weak point in term of used the biometric from the authorize person and insure the person who access the data is the real person. The feature of the simulate system shows the capability of using 3D matching system as an efficient way to identify the person through his or her skull by match it with database, this technique grantee fast processing with optimizing the false positive and negative as well .

- **Summary**: The main focus of image mining in the proposed method is concerned with the classification of brain tumor in the CT scan brain images. The major steps involved in the system are: pre-processing, feature extraction, association rule mining and hybrid classifier. The pre-processing step has been done using the median filtering process and edge features have been extracted using canny edge detection technique. The two image mining approaches with a hybrid manner have been proposed in this paper. The frequent patterns from the CT scan images are generated by frequent pattern tree (FP-Tree) algorithm that mines the association rules. The decision tree method has been used to classify the medical images for diagnosis. This system enhances the classification process to be more accurate. The hybrid method improves the efficiency of the proposed method than the traditional image mining methods. The experimental result on prediagnosed database of brain images showed 97% sensitivity and 95% accuracy respectively. The physicians can make use of this accurate decision tree classification phase for classifying the brain images into normal, benign and malignant for effective medical diagnosis.

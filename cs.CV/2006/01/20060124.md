- **Summary**: This article examines the design of Quadratic Fisher Discriminants (QFDs) that operate directly on image pixels, when image ensembles are taken to comprise all rotated and reflected versions of distinct sample images. A procedure based on group theory is devised to identify and discard QFD coefficients made redundant by symmetry, for arbitrary sampling lattices. This procedure introduces the concept of a degeneracy matrix. Tensor representations are established for the square lattice point group (8-fold symmetry) and hexagonal lattice point group (12-fold symmetry). The analysis is largely applicable to the symmetrisation of any quadratic filter, and generalises to higher order polynomial (Volterra) filters. Experiments on square lattice sampled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery verify that symmetrisation of QFDs can improve their generalisation and discrimination ability.

- **Summary**: A novel algorithm for tunable compression to within the precision of reproduction targets, or storage, is proposed. The new algorithm is termed the `Perceptron Algorithm', which utilises simple existing concepts in a novel way, has multiple immediate commercial application aspects as well as it opens up a multitude of fronts in computational science and technology. The aims of this paper are to present the concepts underlying the algorithm, observations by its application to some example cases, and the identification of a multitude of potential areas of applications such as: image compression by orders of magnitude, signal compression including sound as well, image analysis in a multilayered detailed analysis, pattern recognition and matching and rapid database searching (e.g. face recognition), motion analysis, biomedical applications e.g. in MRI and CAT scan image analysis and compression, as well as hints on the link of these ideas to the way how biological memory might work leading to new points of view in neural computation. Commercial applications of immediate interest are the compression of images at the source (e.g. photographic equipment, scanners, satellite imaging systems), DVD film compression, pay-per-view downloads acceleration and many others identified in the present paper at its conclusion and future work section.

- **Summary**: This short article presents an alternative view of high resolution imaging from various sources with the aim of the discovery of potential sites of archaeological importance, or sites that exhibit `anomalies' such that they may merit closer inspection and analysis. It is conjectured, and to a certain extent demonstrated here, that it is possible for advanced civilizations to factor in erosion by natural processes into a large scale design so that main features be preserved even with the passage of millions of years. Alternatively viewed, even without such intent embedded in a design left for posterity, it is possible that a gigantic construction may naturally decay in such a way that even cataclysmic (massive) events may leave sufficient information intact with the passage of time, provided one changes the point of view from high resolution images to enhanced blurred renderings of the sites in question.

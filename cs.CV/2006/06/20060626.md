- **Summary**: In vector quantization the number of vectors used to construct the codebook is always an undefined problem, there is always a compromise between the number of vectors and the quantity of information lost during the compression. In this text we present a minimum of Entropy principle that gives solution to this compromise and represents an Entropy point of view of signal compression in general. Also we present a new adaptive Object Quantization technique that is the same for the compression and the perception.

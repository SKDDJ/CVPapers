- **Summary**: This article discusses how concepts and methods of complex networks can be applied to real-time imaging and computer vision. After a brief introduction of complex networks basic concepts, their use as means to represent and characterize images, as well as for modeling visual saliency, are briefly described. The possibility to apply complex networks in order to model and simulate the performance of parallel and distributed computing systems for performance of visual methods is also proposed.

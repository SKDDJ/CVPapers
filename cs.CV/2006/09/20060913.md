- **Summary**: Canonical correlation analysis is a technique to extract common features from a pair of multivariate data. In complex situations, however, it does not extract useful features because of its linearity. On the other hand, kernel method used in support vector machine is an efficient approach to improve such a linear method. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of applying kernel method to canonical correlation analysis.

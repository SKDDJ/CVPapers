- **Summary**: This communication describes a representation of images as a set of edges characterized by their position and orientation. This representation allows the comparison of two images and the computation of their similarity. The first step in this computation of similarity is the seach of a geometrical basis of the two dimensional space where the two images are represented simultaneously after transformation of one of them. Presently, this simultaneous representation takes into account a shift and a scaling ; it may be extended to rotations or other global geometrical transformations. An elementary probabilistic computation shows that a sufficient but not excessive number of trials (a few tens) ensures that the exhibition of this common basis is guaranteed in spite of possible errors in the detection of edges. When this first step is performed, the search of similarity between the two images reduces to counting the coincidence of edges in the two images. The approach may be applied to many problems of pattern matching ; it was checked on face recognition.

- **Summary**: This paper proves that in Size Theory the comparison of multidimensional size functions can be reduced to the 1-dimensional case by a suitable change of variables. Indeed, we show that a foliation in half-planes can be given, such that the restriction of a multidimensional size function to each of these half-planes turns out to be a classical size function in two scalar variables. This leads to the definition of a new distance between multidimensional size functions, and to the proof of their stability with respect to that distance.

- **Summary**: A review of works on associative neural networks accomplished during last four years in the Institute of Optical Neural Technologies RAS is given. The presentation is based on description of parametrical neural networks (PNN). For today PNN have record recognizing characteristics (storage capacity, noise immunity and speed of operation). Presentation of basic ideas and principles is accentuated.

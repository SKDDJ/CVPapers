- **Summary**: Action recognition from still images is an important task of computer vision applications such as image annotation, robotic navigation, video surveillance and several others. Existing approaches mainly rely on either bag-of-feature representations or articulated body-part models. However, the relationship between the action and the image segments is still substantially unexplored. For this reason, in this paper we propose to approach action recognition by leveraging an intermediate layer of "superpixels" whose latent classes can act as attributes of the action. In the proposed approach, the action class is predicted by a structural model(learnt by Latent Structural SVM) based on measurements from the image superpixels and their latent classes. Experimental results over the challenging Stanford 40 Actions dataset report a significant average accuracy of 74.06% for the positive class and 88.50% for the negative class, giving evidence to the performance of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Vectors of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) have emerged as powerful image/video representations that compete with or even outperform state-of-the-art approaches on many challenging visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we address two fundamental limitations of VLAD: its requirement for the local descriptors to have vector form and its restriction to linear classifiers due to its high-dimensionality. To this end, we introduce a kernelized version of VLAD. This not only lets us inherently exploit more sophisticated classification schemes, but also enables us to efficiently aggregate non-vector descriptors (e.g., tensors) in the VLAD framework. Furthermore, we propose three approximate formulations that allow us to accelerate the coding process while still benefiting from the properties of kernel VLAD. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at handling manifold-valued data, such as covariance descriptors, on several classification tasks. Our results also evidence the benefits of our nonlinear VLAD descriptors against the linear ones in Euclidean space using several standard benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose and study a technique to impose structural constraints on the output of a neural network, which can reduce amount of computation and number of parameters besides improving prediction accuracy when the output is known to approximately conform to the low-rankness prior. The technique proceeds by replacing the output layer of neural network with the so-called MLM layers, which forces the output to be the result of some Multilinear Map, like a hybrid-Kronecker-dot product or Kronecker Tensor Product. In particular, given an "autoencoder" model trained on SVHN dataset, we can construct a new model with MLM layer achieving 62\% reduction in total number of parameters and reduction of $\ell_2$ reconstruction error from 0.088 to 0.004. Further experiments on other autoencoder model variants trained on SVHN datasets also demonstrate the efficacy of MLM layers.

- **Summary**: We present a method of estimating the number of people in high density crowds from still images. The method estimates counts by fusing information from multiple sources. Most of the existing work on crowd counting deals with very small crowds (tens of individuals) and use temporal information from videos. Our method uses only still images to estimate the counts in high density images (hundreds to thousands of individuals). At this scale, we cannot rely on only one set of features for count estimation. We, therefore, use multiple sources, viz. interest points (SIFT), Fourier analysis, wavelet decomposition, GLCM features and low confidence head detections, to estimate the counts. Each of these sources gives a separate estimate of the count along with confidences and other statistical measures which are then combined to obtain the final estimate. We test our method on an existing dataset of fifty images containing over 64000 individuals. Further, we added another fifty annotated images of crowds and tested on the complete dataset of hundred images containing over 87000 individuals. The counts per image range from 81 to 4633. We report the performance in terms of mean absolute error, which is a measure of accuracy of the method, and mean normalised absolute error, which is a measure of the robustness.

- **Summary**: The key in agglomerative clustering is to define the affinity measure between two sets. A novel agglomerative clustering method is proposed by utilizing the path integral to define the affinity measure. Firstly, the path integral descriptor of an edge, a node and a set is computed by path integral and exponent generating function. Then, the affinity measure between two sets is obtained by path integral descriptor of sets. Several good properties of the path integral descriptor is proposed in this paper. In addition, we give the physical interpretation of the proposed path integral descriptor of a set. The proposed path integral descriptor of a set can be regard as the collectiveness measure of a set, which can be a moving system such as human crowd, sheep herd and so on. Self-driven particle (SDP) model is used to test the ability of the proposed method in measuring collectiveness.

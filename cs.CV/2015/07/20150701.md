- **Summary**: This paper presents a simple yet effective supervised deep hash approach that constructs binary hash codes from labeled data for large-scale image search. We assume that the semantic labels are governed by several latent attributes with each attribute on or off, and classification relies on these attributes. Based on this assumption, our approach, dubbed supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH), constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design, SSDH has a nice characteristic that classification and retrieval are unified in a single learning model. Moreover, SSDH performs joint learning of image representations, hash codes, and classification in a point-wised manner, and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classification; yet it is effective and outperforms other hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, SSDH achieves higher retrieval accuracy, while the classification performance is not sacrificed.

- **Summary**: For polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image classification, it is a challenge to classify the aggregated terrain types, such as the urban area, into semantic homogenous regions due to sharp bright-dark variations in intensity. The aggregated terrain type is formulated by the similar ground objects aggregated together. In this paper, a polarimetric hierarchical semantic model (PHSM) is firstly proposed to overcome this disadvantage based on the constructions of a primal-level and a middle-level semantic. The primal-level semantic is a polarimetric sketch map which consists of sketch segments as the sparse representation of a PolSAR image. The middle-level semantic is a region map which can extract semantic homogenous regions from the sketch map by exploiting the topological structure of sketch segments. Mapping the region map to the PolSAR image, a complex PolSAR scene is partitioned into aggregated, structural and homogenous pixel-level subspaces with the characteristics of relatively coherent terrain types in each subspace. Then, according to the characteristics of three subspaces above, three specific methods are adopted, and furthermore polarimetric information is exploited to improve the segmentation result. Experimental results on PolSAR data sets with different bands and sensors demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in region homogeneity and edge preservation for terrain classification.

- **Summary**: The interest of compressive sampling in ultrasound imaging has been recently extensively evaluated by several research teams. Following the different application setups, it has been shown that the RF data may be reconstructed from a small number of measurements and/or using a reduced number of ultrasound pulse emissions. Nevertheless, RF image spatial resolution, contrast and signal to noise ratio are affected by the limited bandwidth of the imaging transducer and the physical phenomenon related to US wave propagation. To overcome these limitations, several deconvolution-based image processing techniques have been proposed to enhance the ultrasound images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named compressive deconvolution, that reconstructs enhanced RF images from compressed measurements. Exploiting an unified formulation of the direct acquisition model, combining random projections and 2D convolution with a spatially invariant point spread function, the benefit of our approach is the joint data volume reduction and image quality improvement. The proposed optimization method, based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.

- **Summary**: We explore the efficiency of the CRF inference module beyond image level semantic segmentation. The key idea is to combine the best of two worlds of semantic co-labeling and exploiting more expressive models. Similar to [Alvarez14] our formulation enables us perform inference over ten thousand images within seconds. On the other hand, it can handle higher-order clique potentials similar to [vineet2014] in terms of region-level label consistency and context in terms of co-occurrences. We follow the mean-field updates for higher order potentials similar to [vineet2014] and extend the spatial smoothness and appearance kernels [DenseCRF13] to address video data inspired by [Alvarez14]; thus making the system amenable to perform video semantic segmentation most effectively.

- **Summary**: We present a method for learning an embedding that places images of humans in similar poses nearby. This embedding can be used as a direct method of comparing images based on human pose, avoiding potential challenges of estimating body joint positions. Pose embedding learning is formulated under a triplet-based distance criterion. A deep architecture is used to allow learning of a representation capable of making distinctions between different poses. Experiments on human pose matching and retrieval from video data demonstrate the potential of the method.

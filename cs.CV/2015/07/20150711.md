- **Summary**: One popular approach to interactively segment the foreground object of interest from an image is to annotate a bounding box that covers the foreground object. Then, a binary labeling is performed to achieve a refined segmentation. One major issue of the existing algorithms for such interactive image segmentation is their preference of an input bounding box that tightly encloses the foreground object. This increases the annotation burden, and prevents these algorithms from utilizing automatically detected bounding boxes. In this paper, we develop a new LooseCut algorithm that can handle cases where the input bounding box only loosely covers the foreground object. We propose a new Markov Random Fields (MRF) model for segmentation with loosely bounded boxes, including a global similarity constraint to better distinguish the foreground and background, and an additional energy term to encourage consistent labeling of similar-appearance pixels. This MRF model is then solved by an iterated max-flow algorithm. In the experiments, we evaluate LooseCut in three publicly-available image datasets, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation algorithms. We also show that LooseCut can be used for enhancing the performance of unsupervised video segmentation and image saliency detection.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a supervised initialization scheme for cascaded face alignment based on explicit head pose estimation. We first investigate the failure cases of most state of the art face alignment approaches and observe that these failures often share one common global property, i.e. the head pose variation is usually large. Inspired by this, we propose a deep convolutional network model for reliable and accurate head pose estimation. Instead of using a mean face shape, or randomly selected shapes for cascaded face alignment initialisation, we propose two schemes for generating initialisation: the first one relies on projecting a mean 3D face shape (represented by 3D facial landmarks) onto 2D image under the estimated head pose; the second one searches nearest neighbour shapes from the training set according to head pose distance. By doing so, the initialisation gets closer to the actual shape, which enhances the possibility of convergence and in turn improves the face alignment performance. We demonstrate the proposed method on the benchmark 300W dataset and show very competitive performance in both head pose estimation and face alignment.

- **Summary**: Practical face recognition has been studied in the past decades, but still remains an open challenge. Current prevailing approaches have already achieved substantial breakthroughs in recognition accuracy. However, their performance usually drops dramatically if face samples are severely misaligned. To address this problem, we propose a highly efficient misalignment-robust locality-constrained representation (MRLR) algorithm for practical real-time face recognition. Specifically, the locality constraint that activates the most correlated atoms and suppresses the uncorrelated ones, is applied to construct the dictionary for face alignment. Then we simultaneously align the warped face and update the locality-constrained dictionary, eventually obtaining the final alignment. Moreover, we make use of the block structure to accelerate the derived analytical solution. Experimental results on public data sets show that MRLR significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and scalability with even better performance.

- **Summary**: Mathematical morphology (MM) helps to describe and analyze shapes using set theory. MM can be effectively applied to binary images which are treated as sets. Basic morphological operators defined can be used as an effective tool in image processing. Morphological operators are also developed based on graph and hypergraph. These operators have found better performance and applications in image processing. Bino et al. [8], [9] developed the theory of morphological operators on hypergraph. A hypergraph structure is considered and basic morphological operation erosion/dilation is defined. Several new operators opening/closing and filtering are also defined on the hypergraphs. Hypergraph based filtering have found comparatively better performance with morphological filters based on graph. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of hypergraph based ASF on binary images. Experimental results shows that hypergraph based ASF filters have outperformed graph based ASF.

- **Summary**: In compressed sensing (CS) framework, a signal is sampled below Nyquist rate, and the acquired compressed samples are generally random in nature. However, for efficient estimation of the actual signal, the sensing matrix must preserve the relative distances among the acquired compressed samples. Provided this condition is fulfilled, we show that CS samples will preserve the envelope of the actual signal even at different compression ratios. Exploiting this envelope preserving property of CS samples, we propose a new fast dictionary learning (DL) algorithm which is able to extract prototype signals from compressive samples for efficient sparse representation and recovery of signals. These prototype signals are orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is one of the popular methods to capture the envelope of a signal. The extracted IMFs are used to build the dictionary without even comprehending the original signal or the sensing matrix. Moreover, one can build the dictionary on-line as new CS samples are available. In particularly, to recover first $L$ signals ($\in\mathbb{R}^n$) at the decoder, one can build the dictionary in just $\mathcal{O}(nL\log n)$ operations, that is far less as compared to existing approaches. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated experimentally for recovery of speech signals.

- **Summary**: The object recognition is a complex problem in the image processing. Mathematical morphology is Shape oriented operations, that simplify image data, preserving their essential shape characteristics and eliminating irrelevancies. This paper briefly describes morphological operators using hypergraph and its applications for thinning algorithms. The morphological operators using hypergraph method is used to preventing errors and irregularities in skeleton, and is an important step recognizing line objects. The morphological operators using hypergraph such as dilation, erosion, opening, closing is a novel approach in image processing and it act as a filter remove the noise and errors in the images.

- **Summary**: Digitization of images has made image editing easier. Ease of image editing tempted users and professionals to manipulate digital images leading to digital image forgeries. Today digital image forgery has posed a great threat to the authenticity of the popular digital media, the digital images. A lot of research is going on worldwide to detect image forgery and to separate the forged images from their authentic counterparts. This paper provides a novel intensity invariant detection model (IIDM) for detection of intensity variant clones that is robust against JPEG compression, noise attacks and blurring.

- **Summary**: Several methods have been proposed to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset; the basic ideal behind all of them has been to study an index that measures inter-cluster separation and intra-cluster cohesion over a range of cluster numbers and report the number which gives an optimum value of the index. In this paper we propose a simple, parameter free approach that is like human cognition to form clusters, where closely lying points are easily identified to form a cluster and total number of clusters are revealed. To identify closely lying points, affinity of two points is defined as a function of distance and a threshold affinity is identified, above which two points in a dataset are likely to be in the same cluster. Well separated clusters are identified even in the presence of outliers, whereas for not so well separated dataset, final number of clusters are estimated and the detected clusters are merged to produce the final clusters. Experiments performed with several large dimensional synthetic and real datasets show good results with robustness to noise and density variation within dataset.

- **Summary**: As incremental Structure from Motion algorithms become effective, a good sparse point cloud representing the map of the scene becomes available frame-by-frame. From the 3D Delaunay triangulation of these points, state-of-the-art algorithms build a manifold rough model of the scene. These algorithms integrate incrementally new points to the 3D reconstruction only if their position estimate does not change. Indeed, whenever a point moves in a 3D Delaunay triangulation, for instance because its estimation gets refined, a set of tetrahedra have to be removed and replaced with new ones to maintain the Delaunay property; the management of the manifold reconstruction becomes thus complex and it entails a potentially big overhead. In this paper we investigate different approaches and we propose an efficient policy to deal with moving points in the manifold estimation process. We tested our approach with four sequences of the KITTI dataset and we show the effectiveness of our proposal in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Tree-structured data usually contain both topological and geometrical information, and are necessarily considered on manifold instead of Euclidean space for appropriate data parameterization and analysis. In this study, we propose a novel tree-structured data parameterization, called Topology-Attribute matrix (T-A matrix), so the data clustering task can be conducted on matrix manifold. We incorporate the structure constraints embedded in data into the negative matrix factorization method to determine meta-trees from the T-A matrix, and the signature vector of each single tree can then be extracted by meta-tree decomposition. The meta-tree space turns out to be a cone space, in which we explore the distance metric and implement the clustering algorithm based on the concepts like Fr\'echet mean. Finally, the T-A matrix based clustering (TAMBAC) framework is evaluated and compared using both simulated data and real retinal images to illustrate its efficiency and accuracy.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose subspace alignment based domain adaptation of the state of the art RCNN based object detector. The aim is to be able to achieve high quality object detection in novel, real world target scenarios without requiring labels from the target domain. While, unsupervised domain adaptation has been studied in the case of object classification, for object detection it has been relatively unexplored. In subspace based domain adaptation for objects, we need access to source and target subspaces for the bounding box features. The absence of supervision (labels and bounding boxes are absent) makes the task challenging. In this paper, we show that we can still adapt sub- spaces that are localized to the object by obtaining detections from the RCNN detector trained on source and applied on target. Then we form localized subspaces from the detections and show that subspace alignment based adaptation between these subspaces yields improved object detection. This evaluation is done by considering challenging real world datasets of PASCAL VOC as source and validation set of Microsoft COCO dataset as target for various categories.

- **Summary**: The complexity of the visual world creates significant challenges for comprehensive visual understanding. In spite of recent successes in visual recognition, today's vision systems would still struggle to deal with visual queries that require a deeper reasoning. We propose a knowledge base (KB) framework to handle an assortment of visual queries, without the need to train new classifiers for new tasks. Building such a large-scale multimodal KB presents a major challenge of scalability. We cast a large-scale MRF into a KB representation, incorporating visual, textual and structured data, as well as their diverse relations. We introduce a scalable knowledge base construction system that is capable of building a KB with half billion variables and millions of parameters in a few hours. Our system achieves competitive results compared to purpose-built models on standard recognition and retrieval tasks, while exhibiting greater flexibility in answering richer visual queries.

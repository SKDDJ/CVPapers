- **Summary**: This paper presents a framework designed for the multi-object detection purposes and adjusted for the application of product search on the market shelves. The framework uses a single feedback loop and a pattern resizing mechanism to demonstrate the top effectiveness of the state-of-the-art local features. A high detection rate with a low false detection chance can be achieved with use of only one pattern per object and no manual parameters adjustments. The method incorporates well known local features and a basic matching process to create a reliable voting space. Further steps comprise of metric transformations, graphical vote space representation, two-phase vote aggregation process and a cascade of verifying filters.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an effective scene text recognition method using sparse coding based features, called Histograms of Sparse Codes (HSC) features. For character detection, we use the HSC features instead of using the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The HSC features are extracted by computing sparse codes with dictionaries that are learned from data using K-SVD, and aggregating per-pixel sparse codes to form local histograms. For word recognition, we integrate multiple cues including character detection scores and geometric contexts in an objective function. The final recognition results are obtained by searching for the words which correspond to the maximum value of the objective function. The parameters in the objective function are learned using the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) training method. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed HSC-based scene text recognition method outperforms HOG-based methods significantly and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to improve the accuracy of texture classification based on extracting texture features using five different texture methods and classifying the patterns using a naive Bayesian classifier. Three statistical-based and two model-based methods are used to extract texture features from eight different texture images, then their accuracy is ranked after using each method individually and in pairs. The accuracy improved up to 97.01% when model based -Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm) - were used together for classification as compared to the highest achieved using each of the five different methods alone; and proved to be better in classifying as compared to statistical methods. Also, using GMRF with statistical based methods, such as Gray level co-occurrence (GLCM) and run-length (RLM) matrices, improved the overall accuracy to 96.94% and 96.55%; respectively.

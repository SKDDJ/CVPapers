- **Summary**: Understanding human activity is very challenging even with the recently developed 3D/depth sensors. To solve this problem, this work investigates a novel deep structured model, which adaptively decomposes an activity instance into temporal parts using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our model advances the traditional deep learning approaches in two aspects. First, { we incorporate latent temporal structure into the deep model, accounting for large temporal variations of diverse human activities. In particular, we utilize the latent variables to decompose the input activity into a number of temporally segmented sub-activities, and accordingly feed them into the parts (i.e. sub-networks) of the deep architecture}. Second, we incorporate a radius-margin bound as a regularization term into our deep model, which effectively improves the generalization performance for classification. For model training, we propose a principled learning algorithm that iteratively (i) discovers the optimal latent variables (i.e. the ways of activity decomposition) for all training instances, (ii) { updates the classifiers} based on the generated features, and (iii) updates the parameters of multi-layer neural networks. In the experiments, our approach is validated on several complex scenarios for human activity recognition and demonstrates superior performances over other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Progressive Visual Analytics aims at improving the interactivity in existing analytics techniques by means of visualization as well as interaction with intermediate results. One key method for data analysis is dimensionality reduction, for example, to produce 2D embeddings that can be visualized and analyzed efficiently. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) is a well-suited technique for the visualization of several high-dimensional data. tSNE can create meaningful intermediate results but suffers from a slow initialization that constrains its application in Progressive Visual Analytics. We introduce a controllable tSNE approximation (A-tSNE), which trades off speed and accuracy, to enable interactive data exploration. We offer real-time visualization techniques, including a density-based solution and a Magic Lens to inspect the degree of approximation. With this feedback, the user can decide on local refinements and steer the approximation level during the analysis. We demonstrate our technique with several datasets, in a real-world research scenario and for the real-time analysis of high-dimensional streams to illustrate its effectiveness for interactive data analysis.

- **Summary**: False alarm is one of the main concerns in intensive care units and can result in care disruption, sleep deprivation, and insensitivity of care-givers to alarms. Several methods have been proposed to suppress the false alarm rate through improving the quality of physiological signals by filtering, and developing more accurate sensors. However, significant intrinsic correlation among the extracted features limits the performance of most currently available data mining techniques, as they often discard the predictors with low individual impact that may potentially have strong discriminatory power when grouped with others. We propose a model based on coalition game theory that considers the inter-features dependencies in determining the salient predictors in respect to false alarm, which results in improved classification accuracy. The superior performance of this method compared to current methods is shown in simulation results using PhysionNet's MIMIC II database.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a framework for secure identification using deep neural networks, and apply it to the task of template protection for face authentication. We use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn a mapping from face images to maximum entropy binary (MEB) codes. The mapping is robust enough to tackle the problem of exact matching, yielding the same code for new samples of a user as the code assigned during training. These codes are then hashed using any hash function that follows the random oracle model (like SHA-512) to generate protected face templates (similar to text based password protection). The algorithm makes no unrealistic assumptions and offers high template security, cancelability, and state-of-the-art matching performance. The efficacy of the approach is shown on CMU-PIE, Extended Yale B, and Multi-PIE face databases. We achieve high (~95%) genuine accept rates (GAR) at zero false accept rate (FAR) with up to 1024 bits of template security.

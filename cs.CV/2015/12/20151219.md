- **Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has achieved notable successes in many machine learning tasks. A number of frameworks have been developed to expedite the process of designing and training deep neural networks (DNNs), such as Caffe, Torch and Theano. Currently they can harness multiple GPUs on a single machine, but are unable to use GPUs that are distributed across multiple machines; as even average-sized DNNs can take days to train on a single GPU with 100s of GBs to TBs of data, distributed GPUs present a prime opportunity for scaling up DL. However, the limited bandwidth available on commodity Ethernet networks presents a bottleneck to distributed GPU training, and prevents its trivial realization.   To investigate how to adapt existing frameworks to efficiently support distributed GPUs, we propose Poseidon, a scalable system architecture for distributed inter-machine communication in existing DL frameworks. We integrate Poseidon with Caffe and evaluate its performance at training DNNs for object recognition. Poseidon features three key contributions that accelerate DNN training on clusters: (1) a three-level hybrid architecture that allows Poseidon to support both CPU-only and GPU-equipped clusters, (2) a distributed wait-free backpropagation (DWBP) algorithm to improve GPU utilization and to balance communication, and (3) a structure-aware communication protocol (SACP) to minimize communication overheads. We empirically show that Poseidon converges to same objectives as a single machine, and achieves state-of-art training speedup across multiple models and well-established datasets using a commodity GPU cluster of 8 nodes (e.g. 4.5x speedup on AlexNet, 4x on GoogLeNet, 4x on CIFAR-10). On the much larger ImageNet22K dataset, Poseidon with 8 nodes achieves better speedup and competitive accuracy to recent CPU-based distributed systems such as Adam and Le et al., which use 10s to 1000s of nodes.

- **Summary**: The objective of this study is to develop a patch-based labeling method that cooperates with a label fusion using non-rigid registrations. We present a novel patch-based label fusion method, whose selected patches and their weights are calculated from a combination of similarity measures between patches using intensity-based distances and labeling-based distances, where a previous labeling of the target image is inferred through a label fusion method using non-rigid registrations. These combined similarity measures result in better selection of the patches, and their weights are more robust, which improves the segmentation results compared to other label fusion methods, including the conventional patch-based labeling method. To evaluate the performance and the robustness of the proposed label fusion method, we employ two available databases of T1-weighted (T1W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human brains. We compare our approach with other label fusion methods in the automatic hippocampal segmentation from T1W-MRI.   Our label fusion method yields mean Dice coefficients of 0.847 and 0.798 for the two databases used with mean times of approximately 180 and 320 seconds, respectively. The collaboration between the patch-based labeling method and the label fusion using non-rigid registrations is given in the several levels: (a) The pre-selection of the patches in the atlases are improved, (b) The weights of our selected patches are also more robust, (c) our approach imposes geometrical restrictions, such as shape priors, and (d) the work-flow is very efficient. We show that the proposed approach is very competitive with respect to recently reported methods.

- **Summary**: Several methods have been proposed for large-scale 3D reconstruction from large, unorganized image collections. A large reconstruction problem is typically divided into multiple components which are reconstructed independently using structure from motion (SFM) and later merged together. Incremental SFM methods are most popular for the basic structure recovery of a single component. They are robust and effective but are strictly sequential in nature. We present a multistage approach for SFM reconstruction of a single component that breaks the sequential nature of the incremental SFM methods. Our approach begins with quickly building a coarse 3D model using only a fraction of features from given images. The coarse model is then enriched by localizing remaining images and matching and triangulating remaining features in subsequent stages. These stages are made efficient and highly parallel by leveraging the geometry of the coarse model. Our method produces similar quality models as compared to incremental SFM methods while being notably fast and parallel.

- **Summary**: Interactive image segmentation is a challenging task and receives increasing attention recently; however, two major drawbacks exist in interactive segmentation approaches. First, the segmentation performance of ROI-based methods is sensitive to the initial ROI: different ROIs may produce results with great difference. Second, most seed-based methods need intense interactions, and are not applicable in many cases. In this work, we generalize the Neutro-Connectedness (NC) to be independent of top-down priors of objects and to model image topology with indeterminacy measurement on image regions, propose a novel method for determining object and background regions, which is applied to exclude isolated background regions and enforce label consistency, and put forward a hybrid interactive segmentation method, Neutro-Connectedness Cut (NC-Cut), which can overcome the above two problems by utilizing both pixel-wise appearance information and region-based NC properties. We evaluate the proposed NC-Cut by employing two image datasets (265 images), and demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation methods (Grabcut, MILCut, One-Cut, MGC_max^sum and pPBC).

- **Summary**: The simultaneous capture of imaging data at multiple wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum is highly challenging, requiring complex and costly multispectral image sensors. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for performing simultaneous multispectral imaging using conventional image sensors with color filter arrays via numerical demultiplexing of the color image sensor measurements. A numerical forward model characterizing the formation of sensor measurements from light spectra hitting the sensor is constructed based on a comprehensive spectral characterization of the sensor. A numerical demultiplexer is then learned via non-linear random forest modeling based on the forward model. Given the learned numerical demultiplexer, one can then demultiplex simultaneously-acquired measurements made by the image sensor into reflectance intensities at discrete selectable wavelengths, resulting in a higher resolution reflectance spectrum. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of such a method for simultaneous multispectral imaging.

- **Summary**: Search with local intent is becoming increasingly useful due to the popularity of the mobile device. The creation and maintenance of accurate listings of local businesses worldwide is time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically discover businesses that are visible on street level imagery. Precise business store front detection enables accurate geo-location of businesses, and further provides input for business categorization, listing generation, etc. The large variety of business categories in different countries makes this a very challenging problem. Moreover, manual annotation is prohibitive due to the scale of this problem. We propose the use of a MultiBox based approach that takes input image pixels and directly outputs store front bounding boxes. This end-to-end learning approach instead preempts the need for hand modeling either the proposal generation phase or the post-processing phase, leveraging large labelled training datasets. We demonstrate our approach outperforms the state of the art detection techniques with a large margin in terms of performance and run-time efficiency. In the evaluation, we show this approach achieves human accuracy in the low-recall settings. We also provide an end-to-end evaluation of business discovery in the real world.

- **Summary**: High resolution ultrasound image reconstruction from a reduced number of measurements is of great interest in ultrasound imaging, since it could enhance both the frame rate and image resolution. Compressive deconvolution, combining compressed sensing and image deconvolution, represents an interesting possibility to consider this challenging task. The model of compressive deconvolution includes, in addition to the compressive sampling matrix, a 2D convolution operator carrying the information on the system point spread function. Through this model, the resolution of reconstructed ultrasound images from compressed measurements mainly depends on three aspects: the acquisition setup, i.e. the incoherence of the sampling matrix, the image regularization, i.e. the sparsity prior, and the optimization technique. In this paper, we mainly focused on the last two aspects. We proposed a novel simultaneous direction method of multipliers-based optimization scheme to invert the linear model, including two regularization terms expressing the sparsity of the RF images in a given basis and the generalized Gaussian statistical assumption on tissue reflectivity functions. The performance of the method is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.

- **Summary**: Learning deeper convolutional neural networks becomes a tendency in recent years. However, many empirical evidences suggest that performance improvement cannot be gained by simply stacking more layers. In this paper, we consider the issue from an information theoretical perspective, and propose a novel method Relay Backpropagation, that encourages the propagation of effective information through the network in training stage. By virtue of the method, we achieved the first place in ILSVRC 2015 Scene Classification Challenge. Extensive experiments on two challenging large scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method is not restricted to a specific dataset or network architecture. Our models will be available to the research community later.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning is a recent field of machine learning research that aims to resolve the challenge of dealing with insufficient training data in the domain of interest. This is a particular issue with traditional deep neural networks where a large amount of training data is needed. Recently, StochasticNets was proposed to take advantage of sparse connectivity in order to decrease the number of parameters that needs to be learned, which in turn may relax training data size requirements. In this paper, we study the efficacy of transfer learning on StochasticNet frameworks. Experimental results show ~7% improvement on StochasticNet performance when the transfer learning is applied in training step.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks demonstrated outstanding empirical results in computer vision and speech recognition tasks where labeled training data is abundant. In medical imaging, there is a huge variety of possible imaging modalities and contrasts, where annotated data is usually very scarce. We present two approaches to deal with this challenge. A network pretrained in a different domain with abundant data is used as a feature extractor, while a subsequent classifier is trained on a small target dataset; and a deep architecture trained with heavy augmentation and equipped with sophisticated regularization methods. We test the approaches on a corpus of X-ray images to design an anatomy detection system.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses fully automated multi-person tracking in complex environments with challenging occlusion and extensive pose variations. Our solution combines multiple detectors for a set of different regions of interest (e.g., full-body and head) for multi-person tracking. The use of multiple detectors leads to fewer miss detections as it is able to exploit the complementary strengths of the individual detectors. While the number of false positives may increase with the increased number of bounding boxes detected from multiple detectors, we propose to group the detection outputs by bounding box location and depth information. For robustness to significant pose variations, deformable spatial relationship between detectors are learnt in our multi-person tracking system. On RGBD data from a live Intensive Care Unit (ICU), we show that the proposed method significantly improves multi-person tracking performance over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Most face super-resolution methods assume that low-resolution and high-resolution manifolds have similar local geometrical structure, hence learn local models on the lowresolution manifolds (e.g. sparse or locally linear embedding models), which are then applied on the high-resolution manifold. However, the low-resolution manifold is distorted by the oneto-many relationship between low- and high- resolution patches. This paper presents a method which learns linear models based on the local geometrical structure on the high-resolution manifold rather than on the low-resolution manifold. For this, in a first step, the low-resolution patch is used to derive a globally optimal estimate of the high-resolution patch. The approximated solution is shown to be close in Euclidean space to the ground-truth but is generally smooth and lacks the texture details needed by state-ofthe-art face recognizers. This first estimate allows us to find the support of the high-resolution manifold using sparse coding (SC), which are then used as support for learning a local projection (or upscaling) model between the low-resolution and the highresolution manifolds using Multivariate Ridge Regression (MRR). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms six face super-resolution methods in terms of both recognition and quality. These results also reveal that the recognition and quality are significantly affected by the method used for stitching all super-resolved patches together, where quilting was found to better preserve the texture details which helps to achieve higher recognition rates.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we report a hidden Markov model based multiclass classification of cervical cancer tissues. This model has been validated directly over time series generated by the medium refractive index fluctuations extracted from differential interference contrast images of healthy and different stages of cancer tissues. The method shows promising results for multiclass classification with higher accuracy.

  It is intended for wider scope
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: This paper considers the intra-image color-space of an object or a scene when these are subject to a dominant single-source of variation. The source of variation can be intrinsic or extrinsic (i.e., imaging conditions) to the object. We observe that the quantized colors for such objects typically lie on a planar subspace of RGB, and in some cases linear or polynomial curves on this plane are effective in capturing these color variations. We also observe that the inter-image color sub-spaces are robust as long as drastic illumination change is not involved.   We illustrate the use of this analysis for: discriminating between shading-change and reflectance-change for patches, and object detection, segmentation and recognition based on a single exemplar. We focus on images of food items to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

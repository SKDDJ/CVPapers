- **Summary**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging technology for the screening and diagnosis of frequently occurring cancers. However image quality may suffer by long acquisition times for MRIs due to patient motion, as well as result in great patient discomfort. Reducing MRI acquisition time can reduce patient discomfort and as a result reduces motion artifacts from the acquisition process. Compressive sensing strategies, when applied to MRI, have been demonstrated to be effective at decreasing acquisition times significantly by sparsely sampling the \emph{k}-space during the acquisition process. However, such a strategy requires advanced reconstruction algorithms to produce high quality and reliable images from compressive sensing MRI. This paper proposes a new reconstruction approach based on cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields (CD-SFCRF) for compressive sensing MRI. The CD-SFCRF introduces constraints in both \emph{k}-space and spatial domains within a stochastically fully connected graphical model to produce improved MRI reconstruction. Experimental results using T2-weighted (T2w) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate show strong performance in preserving fine details and tissue structures in the reconstructed images when compared to other tested methods even at low sampling rates.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets is an essential step for calculation of clinical indices such as ventricular volume and ejection fraction. In this work, we employ deep learning algorithms combined with deformable models to develop and evaluate a fully automatic segmentation tool for the LV from short-axis cardiac MRI datasets. The method employs deep learning algorithms to learn the segmentation task from the ground true data. Convolutional networks are employed to automatically detect the LV chamber in MRI dataset. Stacked autoencoders are utilized to infer the shape of the LV. The inferred shape is incorporated into deformable models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the segmentation. We validated our method using 45 cardiac MR datasets taken from the MICCAI 2009 LV segmentation challenge and showed that it outperforms the state-of-the art methods. Excellent agreement with the ground truth was achieved. Validation metrics, percentage of good contours, Dice metric, average perpendicular distance and conformity, were computed as 96.69%, 0.94, 1.81mm and 0.86, versus those of 79.2%-95.62%, 0.87-0.9, 1.76-2.97mm and 0.67-0.78, obtained by other methods, respectively.

- **Summary**: Noise is one of the major problems that hinder an effective texture analysis of disease in medical images, which may cause variability in the reported diagnosis. In this paper seven texture measurement methods (two wavelet, two model and three statistical based) were applied to investigate their susceptibility to subtle noise caused by acquisition and reconstruction deficiencies in computed tomography (CT) images. Features of lung tumours were extracted from two different conventional and contrast enhanced CT image data-sets under filtered and noisy conditions. When measuring the noise in the background open-air region of the analysed CT images, noise of Gaussian and Rayleigh distributions with varying mean and variance was encountered, and Fisher distance was used to differentiate between an original extracted lung tumour region of interest (ROI) with the filtered and noisy reconstructed versions. It was determined that the wavelet packet (WP) and fractal dimension measures were the least affected, while the Gaussian Markov random field, run-length and co-occurrence matrices were the most affected by noise. Depending on the selected ROI size, it was concluded that texture measures with fewer extracted features can decrease susceptibility to noise, with the WP and the Gabor filter having a stable performance in both filtered and noisy CT versions and for both data-sets. Knowing how robust each texture measure under noise presence is can assist physicians using an automated lung texture classification system in choosing the appropriate feature extraction algorithm for a more accurate diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Providing an improved technique which can assist pathologists in correctly classifying meningioma tumours with a significant accuracy is our main objective. The proposed technique, which is based on optimum texture measure combination, inspects the separability of the RGB colour channels and selects the channel which best segments the cell nuclei of the histopathological images. The morphological gradient was applied to extract the region of interest for each subtype and for elimination of possible noise (e.g. cracks) which might occur during biopsy preparation. Meningioma texture features are extracted by four different texture measures (two model-based and two statistical-based) and then corresponding features are fused together in different combinations after excluding highly correlated features, and a Bayesian classifier was used for meningioma subtype discrimination. The combined Gaussian Markov random field and run-length matrix texture measures outperformed all other combinations in terms of quantitatively characterising the meningioma tissue, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 92.50%, improving from 83.75% which is the best accuracy achieved if the texture measures are used individually.

- **Summary**: Tissue texture is known to exhibit a heterogeneous or non-stationary nature, therefore using a single resolution approach for optimum classification might not suffice. A clinical decision support system that exploits the subband textural fractal characteristics for best bases selection of meningioma brain histopathological image classification is proposed. Each subband is analysed using its fractal dimension instead of energy, which has the advantage of being less sensitive to image intensity and abrupt changes in tissue texture. The most significant subband that best identifies texture discontinuities will be chosen for further decomposition, and its fractal characteristics would represent the optimal feature vector for classification. The performance was tested using the support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifiers and a leave-one-patient-out method was employed for validation. Our method outperformed the classical energy based selection approaches, achieving for SVM, Bayesian and kNN classifiers an overall classification accuracy of 94.12%, 92.50% and 79.70%, as compared to 86.31%, 83.19% and 51.63% for the co-occurrence matrix, and 76.01%, 73.50% and 50.69% for the energy texture signatures, respectively. These results indicate the potential usefulness as a decision support system that could complement radiologists diagnostic capability to discriminate higher order statistical textural information, for which it would be otherwise difficult via ordinary human vision.

- **Summary**: Pointwise matches between two time series are of great importance in time series analysis, and dynamic time warping (DTW) is known to provide generally reasonable matches. There are situations where time series alignment should be invariant to scaling and offset in amplitude or where local regions of the considered time series should be strongly reflected in pointwise matches. Two different variants of DTW, affine DTW (ADTW) and regional DTW (RDTW), are proposed to handle scaling and offset in amplitude and provide regional emphasis respectively. Furthermore, ADTW and RDTW can be combined in two different ways to generate alignments that incorporate advantages from both methods, where the affine model can be applied either globally to the entire time series or locally to each region. The proposed alignment methods outperform DTW on specific simulated datasets, and one-nearest-neighbor classifiers using their associated difference measures are competitive with the difference measures associated with state-of-the-art alignment methods on real datasets.

- **Summary**: The bilateral filter has diverse applications in image processing, computer vision, and computational photography. In particular, this non-linear filter is quite effective in denoising images corrupted with additive Gaussian noise. The filter, however, is known to perform poorly at large noise levels. Several adaptations of the filter have been proposed in the literature to address this shortcoming, but often at an added computational cost. In this paper, we report a simple yet effective modification that improves the denoising performance of the bilateral filter at almost no additional cost. We provide visual and quantitative results on standard test images which show that this improvement is significant both visually and in terms of PSNR and SSIM (often as large as 5 dB). We also demonstrate how the proposed filtering can be implemented at reduced complexity by adapting a recent idea for fast bilateral filtering.

- **Summary**: Detecting edges is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many applications, some involving very noisy images. While most edge detection methods are fast, they perform well only on relatively clean images. Indeed, edges in such images can be reliably detected using only local filters. Detecting faint edges under high levels of noise cannot be done locally at the individual pixel level, and requires more sophisticated global processing. Unfortunately, existing methods that achieve this goal are quite slow. In this paper we develop a novel multiscale method to detect curved edges in noisy images. While our algorithm searches for edges over a huge set of candidate curves, it does so in a practical runtime, nearly linear in the total number of image pixels. As we demonstrate experimentally, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than previous methods designed to deal with high noise levels. Nevertheless, it obtains comparable, if not better, edge detection quality on a variety of challenging noisy images.

- **Summary**: With a view to provide a user-friendly interface for designing, training and developing deep learning frameworks, we have developed Expresso, a GUI tool written in Python. Expresso is built atop Caffe, the open-source, prize-winning framework popularly used to develop Convolutional Neural Networks. Expresso provides a convenient wizard-like graphical interface which guides the user through various common scenarios -- data import, construction and training of deep networks, performing various experiments, analyzing and visualizing the results of these experiments. The multi-threaded nature of Expresso enables concurrent execution and notification of events related to the aforementioned scenarios. The GUI sub-components and inter-component interfaces in Expresso have been designed with extensibility in mind. We believe Expresso's flexibility and ease of use will come in handy to researchers, newcomers and seasoned alike, in their explorations related to deep learning.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have successfully contributed to improve the accuracy of regression-based methods for computer vision tasks such as human pose estimation, landmark localization, and object detection. The network optimization has been usually performed with L2 loss and without considering the impact of outliers on the training process, where an outlier in this context is defined by a sample estimation that lies at an abnormal distance from the other training sample estimations in the objective space. In this work, we propose a regression model with ConvNets that achieves robustness to such outliers by minimizing Tukey's biweight function, an M-estimator robust to outliers, as the loss function for the ConvNet. In addition to the robust loss, we introduce a coarse-to-fine model, which processes input images of progressively higher resolutions for improving the accuracy of the regressed values. In our experiments, we demonstrate faster convergence and better generalization of our robust loss function for the tasks of human pose estimation and age estimation from face images. We also show that the combination of the robust loss function with the coarse-to-fine model produces comparable or better results than current state-of-the-art approaches in four publicly available human pose estimation datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent years, low-rank based tensor completion, which is a higher-order extension of matrix completion, has received considerable attention. However, the low-rank assumption is not sufficient for the recovery of visual data, such as color and 3D images, where the ratio of missing data is extremely high. In this paper, we consider "smoothness" constraints as well as low-rank approximations, and propose an efficient algorithm for performing tensor completion that is particularly powerful regarding visual data. The proposed method admits significant advantages, owing to the integration of smooth PARAFAC decomposition for incomplete tensors and the efficient selection of models in order to minimize the tensor rank. Thus, our proposed method is termed as "smooth PARAFAC tensor completion (SPC)." In order to impose the smoothness constraints, we employ two strategies, total variation (SPC-TV) and quadratic variation (SPC-QV), and invoke the corresponding algorithms for model learning. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world visual data illustrate the significant improvements of our method, in terms of both prediction performance and efficiency, compared with many state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.

- **Summary**: We present an innovative method called FilExSeC (Filaments Extraction, Selection and Classification), a data mining tool developed to investigate the possibility to refine and optimize the shape reconstruction of filamentary structures detected with a consolidated method based on the flux derivative analysis, through the column-density maps computed from Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) observations of the Galactic plane. The present methodology is based on a feature extraction module followed by a machine learning model (Random Forest) dedicated to select features and to classify the pixels of the input images. From tests on both simulations and real observations the method appears reliable and robust with respect to the variability of shape and distribution of filaments. In the cases of highly defined filament structures, the presented method is able to bridge the gaps among the detected fragments, thus improving their shape reconstruction. From a preliminary "a posteriori" analysis of derived filament physical parameters, the method appears potentially able to add a sufficient contribution to complete and refine the filament reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an effective method to analyze the recognition confidence of handwritten Chinese character, based on the softmax regression score of a high performance convolutional neural networks (CNN). Through careful and thorough statistics of 827,685 testing samples that randomly selected from total 8836 different classes of Chinese characters, we find that the confidence measurement based on CNN is an useful metric to know how reliable the recognition results are. Furthermore, we find by experiments that the recognition confidence can be used to find out similar and confusable character-pairs, to check wrongly or cursively written samples, and even to discover and correct mis-labelled samples. Many interesting observations and statistics are given and analyzed in this study.

- **Summary**: In image processing, it can be a useful pre-processing step to smooth away small structures, such as noise or unimportant details, while retaining the overall structure of the image by keeping edges, which separate objects, sharp. Typically this edge-preserving smoothing process is achieved using edge-aware filters. However such filters may preserve unwanted small structures as well if they contain edges. In this work we present a novel framework for edge-preserving smoothing which separates the process into two different steps: First the image is smoothed using a blurring filter and in the second step the important edges are restored using a guided edge-aware filter. The presented method proves to deliver very good results, compared to state-of-the-art edge-preserving smoothing filters, especially at removing unwanted small structures. Furthermore it is very versatile and can easily be adapted to different fields of applications while at the same time being very fast to compute and therefore well-suited for real time applications.

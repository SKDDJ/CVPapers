- **Summary**: Eye movements are crucial in understanding complex scenes. By predicting where humans look in natural scenes, we can understand how they percieve scenes and priotriaze information for further high-level processing. Here, we study the effect of a particular type of scene structural information known as vanishing point and show that human gaze is attracted to vanishing point regions. We then build a combined model of traditional saliency and vanishing point channel that outperforms state of the art saliency models.

- **Summary**: Saliency modeling has been an active research area in computer vision for about two decades. Existing state of the art models perform very well in predicting where people look in natural scenes. There is, however, the risk that these models may have been overfitting themselves to available small scale biased datasets, thus trapping the progress in a local minimum. To gain a deeper insight regarding current issues in saliency modeling and to better gauge progress, we recorded eye movements of 120 observers while they freely viewed a large number of naturalistic and artificial images. Our stimuli includes 4000 images; 200 from each of 20 categories covering different types of scenes such as Cartoons, Art, Objects, Low resolution images, Indoor, Outdoor, Jumbled, Random, and Line drawings. We analyze some basic properties of this dataset and compare some successful models. We believe that our dataset opens new challenges for the next generation of saliency models and helps conduct behavioral studies on bottom-up visual attention.

- **Summary**: This study aims to analyze the benefits of improved multi-scale reasoning for object detection and localization with deep convolutional neural networks. To that end, an efficient and general object detection framework which operates on scale volumes of a deep feature pyramid is proposed. In contrast to the proposed approach, most current state-of-the-art object detectors operate on a single-scale in training, while testing involves independent evaluation across scales. One benefit of the proposed approach is in better capturing of multi-scale contextual information, resulting in significant gains in both detection performance and localization quality of objects on the PASCAL VOC dataset and a multi-view highway vehicles dataset. The joint detection and localization scale-specific models are shown to especially benefit detection of challenging object categories which exhibit large scale variation as well as detection of small objects.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning model, called PCA-based Convolutional Network (PCN). The architecture of PCN is composed of several feature extraction stages and a nonlinear output stage. Particularly, each feature extraction stage includes two layers: a convolutional layer and a feature pooling layer. In the convolutional layer, the filter banks are simply learned by PCA. In the nonlinear output stage, binary hashing is applied. For the higher convolutional layers, the filter banks are learned from the feature maps that were obtained in the previous stage. To test PCN, we conducted extensive experiments on some challenging tasks, including handwritten digits recognition, face recognition and texture classification. The results show that PCN performs competitive with or even better than state-of-the-art deep learning models. More importantly, since there is no back propagation for supervised finetuning, PCN is much more efficient than existing deep networks.

- **Summary**: We develop a new algorithm for fitting circles that does not have drawbacks commonly found in existing circle fits. Our fit achieves ultimate accuracy (to machine precision), avoids divergence, and is numerically stable even when fitting circles get arbitrary large. Lastly, our algorithm takes less than 10 iterations to converge, on average.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of automatically localizing dominant objects as spatio-temporal tubes in a noisy collection of videos with minimal or even no supervision. We formulate the problem as a combination of two complementary processes: discovery and tracking. The first one establishes correspondences between prominent regions across videos, and the second one associates successive similar object regions within the same video. Interestingly, our algorithm also discovers the implicit topology of frames associated with instances of the same object class across different videos, a role normally left to supervisory information in the form of class labels in conventional image and video understanding methods. Indeed, as demonstrated by our experiments, our method can handle video collections featuring multiple object classes, and substantially outperforms the state of the art in colocalization, even though it tackles a broader problem with much less supervision.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of fitting parametric curves on the Grassmann manifold for the purpose of intrinsic parametric regression. As customary in the literature, we start from the energy minimization formulation of linear least-squares in Euclidean spaces and generalize this concept to general nonflat Riemannian manifolds, following an optimal-control point of view. We then specialize this idea to the Grassmann manifold and demonstrate that it yields a simple, extensible and easy-to-implement solution to the parametric regression problem. In fact, it allows us to extend the basic geodesic model to (1) a time-warped variant and (2) cubic splines. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution on different vision problems, such as shape regression as a function of age, traffic-speed estimation and crowd-counting from surveillance video clips. Most notably, these problems can be conveniently solved within the same framework without any specifically-tailored steps along the processing pipeline.

- **Summary**: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a compact group and let $f_{ij} \in L^2(\mathcal{G})$. We define the Non-Unique Games (NUG) problem as finding $g_1,\dots,g_n \in \mathcal{G}$ to minimize $\sum_{i,j=1}^n f_{ij} \left( g_i g_j^{-1}\right)$. We devise a relaxation of the NUG problem to a semidefinite program (SDP) by taking the Fourier transform of $f_{ij}$ over $\mathcal{G}$, which can then be solved efficiently. The NUG framework can be seen as a generalization of the little Grothendieck problem over the orthogonal group and the Unique Games problem and includes many practically relevant problems, such as the maximum likelihood estimator} to registering bandlimited functions over the unit sphere in $d$-dimensions and orientation estimation in cryo-Electron Microscopy.

- **Summary**: With the widespread availability of cellphones and cameras that have GPS capabilities, it is common for images being uploaded to the Internet today to have GPS coordinates associated with them. In addition to research that tries to predict GPS coordinates from visual features, this also opens up the door to problems that are conditioned on the availability of GPS coordinates. In this work, we tackle the problem of performing image classification with location context, in which we are given the GPS coordinates for images in both the train and test phases. We explore different ways of encoding and extracting features from the GPS coordinates, and show how to naturally incorporate these features into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the current state-of-the-art for most image classification and recognition problems. We also show how it is possible to simultaneously learn the optimal pooling radii for a subset of our features within the CNN framework. To evaluate our model and to help promote research in this area, we identify a set of location-sensitive concepts and annotate a subset of the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100M dataset that has GPS coordinates with these concepts, which we make publicly available. By leveraging location context, we are able to achieve almost a 7% gain in mean average precision.

- **Summary**: The goal of this thesis is to provide a framework for the use of task-based metrics of image quality to aid in the design, implementation, and evaluation of CT image reconstruction algorithms and CT systems in general. We support the view that task-based metrics of image quality can be useful in guiding the algorithm design and implementation process in order to yield images of objectively superior quality and higher utility for a given task. Further, we believe that metrics such as the Hotelling observer (HO) SNR can be used as summary scalar metrics of image quality for the evaluation of images produced by novel reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we aim to construct a concise and versatile formalism for image reconstruction algorithm design, implementation, and assessment. The bulk of the work focuses on linear analytical algorithms, specifically the ubiquitous filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm. However, due to the demonstrated importance of optimization-based algorithms in a wide variety of CT applications, we devote one chapter to the characterization of noise properties in TV-based iterative reconstruction, as the understanding of image statistics in optimization-based reconstruction is the limiting factor in applying HO metrics.

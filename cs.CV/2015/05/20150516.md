- **Summary**: This note gives a preliminary account of the transcoding or rechanneling problem between different stimuli as it is of interest for the natural interaction or affective computing fields. By the consideration of a simple example, namely the color response of an affective lamp to a sensed facial expression, we frame the problem within an information- theoretic perspective. A full justification in terms of the Information Bottleneck principle promotes a latent affective space, hitherto surmised as an appealing and intuitive solution, as a suitable mediator between the different stimuli.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore methods of robustly extracting fiducial facial feature points - an important process for numerous facial image processing tasks. We consider various methods to first detect face, then facial features and finally salient facial feature points. Colour-based models are analysed and their overall unsuitability for this task is summarised. The bulk of the report is then dedicated to proposing a learning-based method centred on the Viola-Jones algorithm. The specific difficulties and considerations relating to feature point detection are laid out in this context and a novel approach is established to address these issues. On a sequence of clear and unobstructed face images, our proposed system achieves average detection rates of over 90%. Then, using a more varied sample dataset, we identify some possible areas for future development of our system.

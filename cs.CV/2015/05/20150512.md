- **Summary**: We have implemented a convolutional neural network designed for processing sparse three-dimensional input data. The world we live in is three dimensional so there are a large number of potential applications including 3D object recognition and analysis of space-time objects. In the quest for efficiency, we experiment with CNNs on the 2D triangular-lattice and 3D tetrahedral-lattice.

- **Summary**: Given the existence of many change detection algorithms, each with its own peculiarities and strengths, we propose a combination strategy, that we termed IUTIS (In Unity There Is Strength), based on a genetic Programming framework. This combination strategy is aimed at leveraging the strengths of the algorithms and compensate for their weakness. In this paper we show our findings in applying the proposed strategy in two different scenarios. The first scenario is purely performance-based. The second scenario performance and efficiency must be balanced. Results demonstrate that starting from simple algorithms we can achieve comparable results with respect to more complex state-of-the-art change detection algorithms, while keeping the computational complexity affordable for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: With the rapid increase of transnational communication and cooperation, people frequently encounter multilingual scenarios in various situations. In this paper, we are concerned with a relatively new problem: script identification at word or line levels in natural scenes. A large-scale dataset with a great quantity of natural images and 10 types of widely used languages is constructed and released. In allusion to the challenges in script identification in real-world scenarios, a deep learning based algorithm is proposed. The experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior performance, compared with conventional image classification methods, such as the original CNN architecture and LLC.

- **Summary**: Automated computer-aided detection (CADe) in medical imaging has been an important tool in clinical practice and research. State-of-the-art methods often show high sensitivities but at the cost of high false-positives (FP) per patient rates. We design a two-tiered coarse-to-fine cascade framework that first operates a candidate generation system at sensitivities of $\sim$100% but at high FP levels. By leveraging existing CAD systems, coordinates of regions or volumes of interest (ROI or VOI) for lesion candidates are generated in this step and function as input for a second tier, which is our focus in this study. In this second stage, we generate $N$ 2D (two-dimensional) or 2.5D views via sampling through scale transformations, random translations and rotations with respect to each ROI's centroid coordinates. These random views are used to train deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) classifiers. In testing, the trained ConvNets are employed to assign class (e.g., lesion, pathology) probabilities for a new set of $N$ random views that are then averaged at each ROI to compute a final per-candidate classification probability. This second tier behaves as a highly selective process to reject difficult false positives while preserving high sensitivities. The methods are evaluated on three different data sets with different numbers of patients: 59 patients for sclerotic metastases detection, 176 patients for lymph node detection, and 1,186 patients for colonic polyp detection. Experimental results show the ability of ConvNets to generalize well to different medical imaging CADe applications and scale elegantly to various data sets. Our proposed methods improve CADe performance markedly in all cases. CADe sensitivities improved from 57% to 70%, from 43% to 77% and from 58% to 75% at 3 FPs per patient for sclerotic metastases, lymph nodes and colonic polyps, respectively.

- **Summary**: In this work it is proposed a medical image segmentation pipeline for accurate bone segmentation from CT imaging. It is a two-step methodology, with a pre-segmentation step and a segmentation refinement step. First, the user performs a rough segmenting of the desired region of interest. Next, a fully automatic refinement step is applied to the pre-segmented data. The automatic segmentation refinement is composed by several sub-stpng, namely image deconvolution, image cropping and interpolation. The user-defined pre-segmentation is then refined over the deconvolved, cropped, and up-sampled version of the image. The algorithm is applied in the segmentation of CT images of a composite femur bone, reconstructed with different reconstruction protocols. Segmentation outcomes are validated against a gold standard model obtained with coordinate measuring machine Nikon Metris LK V20 with a digital line scanner LC60-D that guarantees an accuracy of 28 $\mu m$. High sub-pixel accuracy models were obtained for all tested Datasets. The algorithm is able to produce high quality segmentation of the composite femur regardless of the surface meshing strategy used.

- **Summary**: In this paper we tackle the problem of instance-level segmentation and depth ordering from a single monocular image. Towards this goal, we take advantage of convolutional neural nets and train them to directly predict instance-level segmentations where the instance ID encodes the depth ordering within image patches. To provide a coherent single explanation of an image we develop a Markov random field which takes as input the predictions of convolutional neural nets applied at overlapping patches of different resolutions, as well as the output of a connected component algorithm. It aims to predict accurate instance-level segmentation and depth ordering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging KITTI benchmark and show good performance on both tasks.

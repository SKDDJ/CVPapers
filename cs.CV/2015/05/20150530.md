- **Summary**: Often, videos are composed of multiple concepts or even genres. For instance, news videos may contain sports, action, nature, etc. Therefore, encoding the distribution of such concepts/genres in a compact and effective representation is a challenging task. In this sense, we propose the Bag of Genres representation, which is based on a visual dictionary defined by a genre classifier. Each visual word corresponds to a region in the classification space. The Bag of Genres video vector contains a summary of the activations of each genre in the video content. We evaluate the proposed method for video genre retrieval using the dataset of MediaEval Tagging Task of 2012 and for video event retrieval using the EVVE dataset. Results show that the proposed method achieves results comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods, with the advantage of providing a much more compact representation than existing features.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a SLaT (Smoothing, Lifting and Thresholding) method with three stages for multiphase segmentation of color images corrupted by different degradations: noise, information loss, and blur. At the first stage, a convex variant of the Mumford-Shah model is applied to each channel to obtain a smooth image. We show that the model has unique solution under the different degradations. In order to properly handle the color information, the second stage is dimension lifting where we consider a new vector-valued image composed of the restored image and its transform in the secondary color space with additional information. This ensures that even if the first color space has highly correlated channels, we can still have enough information to give good segmentation results. In the last stage, we apply multichannel thresholding to the combined vector-valued image to find the segmentation. The number of phases is only required in the last stage, so users can choose or change it all without the need of solving the previous stages again. Experiments demonstrate that our SLaT method gives excellent results in terms of segmentation quality and CPU time in comparison with other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: The fusion techniques that utilize multiple feature sets to form new features that are often more robust and contain useful information for future processing are referred to as feature fusion. The term data fusion is applied to the class of techniques used for combining decisions obtained from multiple feature sets to form global decisions. Feature and data fusion interchangeably represent two important classes of techniques that have proved to be of practical importance in a wide range of medical imaging problems

- **Summary**: The recognition of materials and objects inside transparent containers using computer vision has a wide range of applications, ranging from industrial bottles filling to the automation of chemistry laboratory. One of the main challenges in such recognition is the ability to distinguish between image features resulting from the vessels surface and image features resulting from the material inside the vessel. Reflections and the functional parts of a vessels surface can create strong edges that can be mistakenly identified as corresponding to the vessel contents, and cause recognition errors. The ability to evaluate whether a specific edge in an image stems from the vessels surface or from its contents can considerably improve the ability to identify materials inside transparent vessels. This work will suggest a method for such evaluation, based on the following two assumptions: 1) Areas of high curvature on the vessel surface are likely to cause strong edges due to changes in reflectivity, as is the appearance of functional parts (e.g. corks or valves). 2) Most transparent vessels (bottles, glasses) have high symmetry (cylindrical). As a result the curvature angle of the vessels surface at each point of the image is similar to the curvature angle of the contour line of the vessel in the same row in the image. These assumptions, allow the identification of image regions with strong edges corresponding to the vessel surface reflections. Combining this method with existing image analysis methods for detecting materials inside transparent containers allows considerable improvement in accuracy.

- **Summary**: This paper presents an open source tool for testing the recognition accuracy of Chinese handwriting input methods. The tool consists of two modules, namely the PC and Android mobile client. The PC client reads handwritten samples in the computer, and transfers them individually to the Android client in accordance with the socket communication protocol. After the Android client receives the data, it simulates the handwriting on screen of client device, and triggers the corresponding handwriting recognition method. The recognition accuracy is recorded by the Android client. We present the design principles and describe the implementation of the test platform. We construct several test datasets for evaluating different handwriting recognition systems, and conduct an objective and comprehensive test using six Chinese handwriting input methods with five datasets. The test results for the recognition accuracy are then compared and analyzed.

- **Summary**: Technology offers new ways to measure the locations of the players and of the ball in sports. This translates to the trajectories the ball takes on the field as a result of the tactics the team applies. The challenge professionals in soccer are facing is to take the reverse path: given the trajectories of the ball is it possible to infer the underlying strategy/tactic of a team? We propose a method based on Dynamic Time Warping to reveal the tactics of a team through the analysis of repeating series of events. Based on the analysis of an entire season, we derive insights such as passing strategies for maintaining ball possession or counter attacks, and passing styles with a focus on the team or on the capabilities of the individual players.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a human activity recognition method which is based on features learned from 3D video data without incorporating domain knowledge. The experiments on data collected by RGBD cameras produce results outperforming other techniques. Our feature encoding method follows the bag-of-visual-word model, then we use a SVM classifier to recognise the activities. We do not use skeleton or tracking information and the same technique is applied on color and depth data.

- **Summary**: Gait analysis of patients with neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), is important for rehabilitation and treatment. The Mircrosoft Kinect sensor, which was developed for motion recognition in gaming applications, is an ideal candidate for an inexpensive system providing the capability for human gait analysis. In this research, we develop a framework to quantify the gait abnormality of MS patients using a Kinect for Windows camera. In addition to the previously introduced gait indices, a novel set of MS gait indices based on the concept of dynamic time warping is introduced. The newly introduced indices can characterize a patient's gait pattern as a whole and quantify a subject's gait distance from the healthy population. We will investigate the correlation of gait indices with the multiple sclerosis walking scale (MSWS) and the clinical ambulation score. This work establishes the feasibility of using the Kinect sensor for clinical gait assessment for MS patients.

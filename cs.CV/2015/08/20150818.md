- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel Subdivision-Fusion Model (SFM) to recognize human actions. In most action recognition tasks, overlapping feature distribution is a common problem leading to overfitting. In the subdivision stage of the proposed SFM, samples in each category are clustered. Then, such samples are grouped into multiple more concentrated subcategories. Boundaries for the subcategories are easier to find and as consequence overfitting is avoided. In the subsequent fusion stage, the multi-subcategories classification results are converted back to the original category recognition problem. Two methods to determine the number of clusters are provided. The proposed model has been thoroughly tested with four popular datasets. In the Hollywood2 dataset, an accuracy of 79.4% is achieved, outperforming the state-of-the-art accuracy of 64.3%. The performance on the YouTube Action dataset has been improved from 75.8% to 82.5%, while considerably improvements are also observed on the KTH and UCF50 datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel low rank representation (LRR) algorithm for data lying on the manifold of square root densities. Unlike traditional LRR methods which rely on the assumption that the data points are vectors in the Euclidean space, our new algorithm is designed to incorporate the intrinsic geometric structure and geodesic distance of the manifold. Experiments on several computer vision datasets showcase its noise robustness and superior performance on classification and subspace clustering compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Context of data points, which is usually defined as the other data points in a data set, has been found to play important roles in data representation and classification. In this paper, we study the problem of using context of a data point for its classification problem. Our work is inspired by the observation that actually only very few data points are critical in the context of a data point for its representation and classification. We propose to represent a data point as the sparse linear combination of its context, and learn the sparse context in a supervised way to increase its discriminative ability. To this end, we proposed a novel formulation for context learning, by modeling the learning of context parameter and classifier in a unified objective, and optimizing it with an alternative strategy in an iterative algorithm. Experiments on three benchmark data set show its advantage over state-of-the-art context-based data representation and classification methods.

- **Summary**: The problem of tag completion is to learn the missing tags of an image. In this paper, we propose to learn a tag scoring vector for each image by local linear learning. A local linear function is used in the neighborhood of each image to predict the tag scoring vectors of its neighboring images. We construct a unified objective function for the learning of both tag scoring vectors and local linear function parame- ters. In the objective, we impose the learned tag scoring vectors to be consistent with the known associations to the tags of each image, and also minimize the prediction error of each local linear function, while reducing the complexity of each local function. The objective function is optimized by an alternate optimization strategy and gradient descent methods in an iterative algorithm. We compare the proposed algorithm against different state-of-the-art tag completion methods, and the results show its advantages.

- **Summary**: Cascaded AdaBoost classifier is a well-known efficient object detection algorithm. The cascade structure has many parameters to be determined. Most of existing cascade learning algorithms are designed by assigning detection rate and false positive rate to each stage either dynamically or statically. Their objective functions are not directly related to minimum computation cost. These algorithms are not guaranteed to have optimal solution in the sense of minimizing computation cost. On the assumption that a strong classifier is given, in this paper we propose an optimal cascade learning algorithm (we call it iCascade) which iteratively partitions the strong classifiers into two parts until predefined number of stages are generated. iCascade searches the optimal number ri of weak classifiers of each stage i by directly minimizing the computation cost of the cascade. Theorems are provided to guarantee the existence of the unique optimal solution. Theorems are also given for the proposed efficient algorithm of searching optimal parameters ri. Once a new stage is added, the parameter ri for each stage decreases gradually as iteration proceeds, which we call decreasing phenomenon. Moreover, with the goal of minimizing computation cost, we develop an effective algorithm for setting the optimal threshold of each stage classifier. In addition, we prove in theory why more new weak classifiers are required compared to the last stage. Experimental results on face detection demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

- **Summary**: We present a face detection algorithm based on Deformable Part Models and deep pyramidal features. The proposed method called DP2MFD is able to detect faces of various sizes and poses in unconstrained conditions. It reduces the gap in training and testing of DPM on deep features by adding a normalization layer to the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Extensive experiments on four publicly available unconstrained face detection datasets show that our method is able to capture the meaningful structure of faces and performs significantly better than many competitive face detection algorithms.

- **Summary**: Matrix rank minimizing subject to affine constraints arises in many application areas, ranging from signal processing to machine learning. Nuclear norm is a convex relaxation for this problem which can recover the rank exactly under some restricted and theoretically interesting conditions. However, for many real-world applications, nuclear norm approximation to the rank function can only produce a result far from the optimum. To seek a solution of higher accuracy than the nuclear norm, in this paper, we propose a rank approximation based on Logarithm-Determinant. We consider using this rank approximation for subspace clustering application. Our framework can model different kinds of errors and noise. Effective optimization strategy is developed with theoretical guarantee to converge to a stationary point. The proposed method gives promising results on face clustering and motion segmentation tasks compared to the state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.

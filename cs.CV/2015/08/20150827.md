- **Summary**: This paper focuses on structured-output learning using deep neural networks for 3D human pose estimation from monocular images. Our network takes an image and 3D pose as inputs and outputs a score value, which is high when the image-pose pair matches and low otherwise. The network structure consists of a convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, followed by two sub-networks for transforming the image features and pose into a joint embedding. The score function is then the dot-product between the image and pose embeddings. The image-pose embedding and score function are jointly trained using a maximum-margin cost function. Our proposed framework can be interpreted as a special form of structured support vector machines where the joint feature space is discriminatively learned using deep neural networks. We test our framework on the Human3.6m dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results compared to other recent methods. Finally, we present visualizations of the image-pose embedding space, demonstrating the network has learned a high-level embedding of body-orientation and pose-configuration.

- **Summary**: In the paper, we combined DSP processor with image processing algorithm and studied the method of water meter character recognition. We collected water meter image through camera at a fixed angle, and the projection method is used to recognize those digital images. The experiment results show that the method can recognize the meter characters accurately and artificial meter reading is replaced by automatic digital recognition, which improves working efficiency.

- **Summary**: Basic group of visual techniques such as color, shape, texture are used in Content Based Image Retrievals (CBIR) to retrieve query image or subregion of image to find similar images in image database. To improve query result, relevance feedback is used many times in CBIR to help user to express their preference and improve query results.In this paper, a new approach for image retrieval is proposed which is based on the features such as Color Histogram, Eigen Values and Match Point. Images from various types of database are first identified by using edge detection techniques.Once the image is identified, then the image is searched in the particular database, then all related images are displayed. This will save the retrieval time. Further to retrieve the precise query image, any of the three techniques are used and comparison is done w.r.t. average retrieval time. Eigen value technique found to be the best as compared with other two techniques

- **Summary**: The aim of this paper is to present an integrated system consisted of a RGB-D camera and a software able to monitor shoppers in intelligent retail environments. We propose an innovative low cost smart system that can understand the shoppers' behavior and, in particular, their interactions with the products in the shelves, with the aim to develop an automatic RGB-D technique for video analysis. The system of cameras detects the presence of people and univocally identifies them. Through the depth frames, the system detects the interactions of the shoppers with the products on the shelf and determines if a product is picked up or if the product is taken and then put back and finally, if there is not contact with the products. The system is low cost and easy to install, and experimental results demonstrated that its performances are satisfactory also in real environments.

- **Summary**: A rigorous formulation of the dynamics of a signal processing scheme aimed at dense signal scanning without any loss in accuracy is introduced and analyzed. Related methods proposed in the recent past lack a satisfactory analysis of whether they actually fulfill any exactness constraints. This is improved through an exact characterization of the requirements for a sound sliding window approach. The tools developed in this paper are especially beneficial if Convolutional Neural Networks are employed, but can also be used as a more general framework to validate related approaches to signal scanning. The proposed theory helps to eliminate redundant computations and renders special case treatment unnecessary, resulting in a dramatic boost in efficiency particularly on massively parallel processors. This is demonstrated both theoretically in a computational complexity analysis and empirically on modern parallel processors.

- **Summary**: We describe a suite of validation metrics that assess the credibility of a given automatic spike sorting algorithm applied to a given electrophysiological recording, when ground-truth is unavailable. By rerunning the spike sorter two or more times, the metrics measure stability under various perturbations consistent with variations in the data itself, making no assumptions about the noise model, nor about the internal workings of the sorting algorithm. Such stability is a prerequisite for reproducibility of results. We illustrate the metrics on standard sorting algorithms for both in vivo and ex vivo recordings. We believe that such metrics could reduce the significant human labor currently spent on validation, and should form an essential part of large-scale automated spike sorting and systematic benchmarking of algorithms.

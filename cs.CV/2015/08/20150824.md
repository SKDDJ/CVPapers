- **Summary**: We present a longitudinal MR simulation framework which simulates the future neurodegenerative progression by outputting the predicted follow-up MR image and the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) map. This framework expects the patients to have at least 2 historical MR images available. The longitudinal and cross-sectional VBM maps are extracted to measure the affinity between the target subject and the template subjects collected for simulation. Then the follow-up simulation is performed by resampling the latest available target MR image with a weighted sum of non-linear transformations derived from the best-matched templates. The leave-one-out strategy was used to compare different simulation methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art voxel-based method, our proposed morphometry-based simulation achieves better accuracy in most cases.

- **Summary**: Enhancement of human vision to get an insight to information content is of vital importance. The traditional histogram equalization methods have been suffering from amplified contrast with the addition of artifacts and a surprising unnatural visibility of the processed images. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes interative, mean, and multi-threshold selection criterion with plateau limits, which consist of histogram segmentation, clipping and transformation modules. The histogram partition consists of multiple thresholding processes that divide the histogram into two parts, whereas the clipping process nicely enhances the contrast by having a check on the rate of enhancement that could be tuned. Histogram equalization to each segmented sub-histogram provides the output image with preserved brightness and enhanced contrast. Results of the present study showed that the proposed method efficiently handles the noise amplification. Further, it also preserves the brightness by retaining natural look of targeted image.

- **Summary**: We address the issue of adapting optical images-based edge detection techniques for use in Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery. We modify the gravitational edge detection technique (inspired by the Law of Universal Gravity) proposed by Lopez-Molina et al, using the non-standard neighbourhood configuration proposed by Fu et al, to reduce the speckle noise in polarimetric SAR imagery. We compare the modified and unmodified versions of the gravitational edge detection technique with the well-established one proposed by Canny, as well as with a recent multiscale fuzzy-based technique proposed by Lopez-Molina et Alejandro We also address the issues of aggregation of gray level images before and after edge detection and of filtering. All techniques addressed here are applied to a mosaic built using class distributions obtained from a real scene, as well as to the true PolSAR image; the mosaic results are assessed using Baddeley's Delta Metric. Our experiments show that modifying the gravitational edge detection technique with a non-standard neighbourhood configuration produces better results than the original technique, as well as the other techniques used for comparison. The experiments show that adapting edge detection methods from Computational Intelligence for use in PolSAR imagery is a new field worthy of exploration.

- **Summary**: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is widely used to detect left atrium (LA)/left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi. In this paper, the local binary pattern variance (LBPV) features are extracted from region of interest (ROI). And the dynamic features are formed by using the information of its neighbor frames in the sequence. The sequence is viewed as a bag, and the images in the sequence are considered as the instances. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) method is employed to solve the LAA thrombi detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that by using other methods.

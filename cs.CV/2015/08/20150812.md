- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have recently shown excellent results in general object detection and many other tasks. Albeit very effective, they involve many user-defined design choices. In this paper we want to better understand these choices by inspecting two key aspects "what did the network learn?", and "what can the network learn?". We exploit new annotations (Pascal3D+), to enable a new empirical analysis of the R-CNN detector. Despite common belief, our results indicate that existing state-of-the-art convnet architectures are not invariant to various appearance factors. In fact, all considered networks have similar weak points which cannot be mitigated by simply increasing the training data (architectural changes are needed). We show that overall performance can improve when using image renderings for data augmentation. We report the best known results on the Pascal3D+ detection and view-point estimation tasks.

- **Summary**: Image restoration is a long-standing problem in low-level computer vision with many interesting applications. We describe a flexible learning framework based on the concept of nonlinear reaction diffusion models for various image restoration problems. By embodying recent improvements in nonlinear diffusion models, we propose a dynamic nonlinear reaction diffusion model with time-dependent parameters (\ie, linear filters and influence functions). In contrast to previous nonlinear diffusion models, all the parameters, including the filters and the influence functions, are simultaneously learned from training data through a loss based approach. We call this approach TNRD -- \textit{Trainable Nonlinear Reaction Diffusion}. The TNRD approach is applicable for a variety of image restoration tasks by incorporating appropriate reaction force. We demonstrate its capabilities with three representative applications, Gaussian image denoising, single image super resolution and JPEG deblocking. Experiments show that our trained nonlinear diffusion models largely benefit from the training of the parameters and finally lead to the best reported performance on common test datasets for the tested applications. Our trained models preserve the structural simplicity of diffusion models and take only a small number of diffusion steps, thus are highly efficient. Moreover, they are also well-suited for parallel computation on GPUs, which makes the inference procedure extremely fast.

- **Summary**: Structured output prediction aims to learn a predictor to predict a structured output from a input data vector. The structured outputs include vector, tree, sequence, etc. We usually assume that we have a training set of input-output pairs to train the predictor. However, in many real-world appli- cations, it is difficult to obtain the output for a input, thus for many training input data points, the structured outputs are missing. In this paper, we dis- cuss how to learn from a training set composed of some input-output pairs, and some input data points without outputs. This problem is called semi- supervised structured output prediction. We propose a novel method for this problem by constructing a nearest neighbor graph from the input space to present the manifold structure, and using it to regularize the structured out- put space directly. We define a slack structured output for each training data point, and proposed to predict it by learning a structured output predictor. The learning of both slack structured outputs and the predictor are unified within one single minimization problem. In this problem, we propose to mini- mize the structured loss between the slack structured outputs of neighboring data points, and the prediction error measured by the structured loss. The problem is optimized by an iterative algorithm. Experiment results over three benchmark data sets show its advantage.



### Mountain Peak Detection in Online Social Media

- **Summary**: We present a system for the classification of mountain panoramas from user-generated photographs followed by identification and extraction of mountain peaks from those panoramas. We have developed an automatic technique that, given as input a geo-tagged photograph, estimates its FOV (Field Of View) and the direction of the camera using a matching algorithm on the photograph edge maps and a rendered view of the mountain silhouettes that should be seen from the observer's point of view. The extraction algorithm then identifies the mountain peaks present in the photograph and their profiles. We discuss possible applications in social fields such as photograph peak tagging on social portals, augmented reality on mobile devices when viewing a mountain panorama, and generation of collective intelligence systems (such as environmental models) from massive social media collections (e.g. snow water availability maps based on mountain peak states extracted from photograph hosting services).

- **Summary**: We consider a variational method to solve the optical flow problem with varying illumination. We apply an adaptive control of the regularization parameter which allows us to preserve the edges and fine features of the computed flow. To reduce the complexity of the estimation for high resolution images and the time of computations, we implement a multi-level parallel approach based on the domain decomposition with the Schwarz overlapping method. The second level of parallelism uses the massively parallel solver MUMPS. We perform some numerical simulations to show the efficiency of our approach and to validate it on classical and real-world image sequences.

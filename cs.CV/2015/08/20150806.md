- **Summary**: The problem of faces detection in images or video streams is a classical problem of computer vision. The multiple solutions of this problem have been proposed, but the question of their optimality is still open. Many algorithms achieve a high quality face detection, but at the cost of high computational complexity. This restricts their application in the real-time systems. This paper presents a new solution of the frontal face detection problem based on compact convolutional neural networks cascade. The test results on FDDB dataset show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. This proposed detector is implemented using three technologies: SSE/AVX/AVX2 instruction sets for Intel CPUs, Nvidia CUDA, OpenCL. The detection speed of our approach considerably exceeds all the existing CPU-based and GPU-based algorithms. Because of high computational efficiency, our detector can processing 4K Ultra HD video stream in real time (up to 27 fps) on mobile platforms (Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Nvidia Kepler GPUs) in searching objects with the dimension 60x60 pixels or higher. At the same time its performance weakly dependent on the background and number of objects in scene. This is achieved by the asynchronous computation of stages in the cascade.

- **Summary**: Even after over two decades, the total variation (TV) remains one of the most popular regularizations for image processing problems and has sparked a tremendous amount of research, particularly to move from scalar to vector-valued functions. In this paper, we consider the gradient of a color image as a three dimensional matrix or tensor with dimensions corresponding to the spatial extend, the differences to other pixels, and the spectral channels. The smoothness of this tensor is then measured by taking different norms along the different dimensions. Depending on the type of these norms one obtains very different properties of the regularization, leading to novel models for color images. We call this class of regularizations collaborative total variation (CTV). On the theoretical side, we characterize the dual norm, the subdifferential and the proximal mapping of the proposed regularizers. We further prove, with the help of the generalized concept of singular vectors, that an $\ell^{\infty}$ channel coupling makes the most prior assumptions and has the greatest potential to reduce color artifacts. Our practical contributions consist of an extensive experimental section where we compare the performance of a large number of collaborative TV methods for inverse problems like denoising, deblurring and inpainting.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel framework for automated liver segmentation via a level set formulation is presented. A sparse representation of both global (region-based) and local (voxel-wise) image information is embedded in a level set formulation to innovate a new cost function. Two dictionaries are build: A region-based feature dictionary and a voxel-wise dictionary. These dictionaries are learned, using the K-SVD method, from a public database of liver segmentation challenge (MICCAI-SLiver07). The learned dictionaries provide prior knowledge to the level set formulation. For the quantitative evaluation, the proposed method is evaluated using the testing data of MICCAI-SLiver07 database. The results are evaluated using different metric scores computed by the challenge organizers. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework by achieving the highest segmentation accuracy (79.6\%) in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, research efforts to extend linear metric learning models to handle nonlinear structures have attracted great interests. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear solution through the utilization of deformable geometric models to learn spatially varying metrics, and apply the strategy to boost the performance of both kNN and SVM classifiers. Thin-plate splines (TPS) are chosen as the geometric model due to their remarkable versatility and representation power in accounting for high-order deformations. By transforming the input space through TPS, we can pull same-class neighbors closer while pushing different-class points farther away in kNN, as well as make the input data points more linearly separable in SVMs. Improvements in the performance of kNN classification are demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real world datasets, with comparisons made with several state-of-the-art metric learning solutions. Our SVM-based models also achieve significant improvements over traditional linear and kernel SVMs with the same datasets.

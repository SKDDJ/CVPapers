- **Summary**: VGGNets have turned out to be effective for object recognition in still images. However, it is unable to yield good performance by directly adapting the VGGNet models trained on the ImageNet dataset for scene recognition. This report describes our implementation of training the VGGNets on the large-scale Places205 dataset. Specifically, we train three VGGNet models, namely VGGNet-11, VGGNet-13, and VGGNet-16, by using a Multi-GPU extension of Caffe toolbox with high computational efficiency. We verify the performance of trained Places205-VGGNet models on three datasets: MIT67, SUN397, and Places205. Our trained models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on these datasets and are made public available.

- **Summary**: This paper considers the classification of linear subspaces with mismatched classifiers. In particular, we assume a model where one observes signals in the presence of isotropic Gaussian noise and the distribution of the signals conditioned on a given class is Gaussian with a zero mean and a low-rank covariance matrix. We also assume that the classifier knows only a mismatched version of the parameters of input distribution in lieu of the true parameters. By constructing an asymptotic low-noise expansion of an upper bound to the error probability of such a mismatched classifier, we provide sufficient conditions for reliable classification in the low-noise regime that are able to sharply predict the absence of a classification error floor. Such conditions are a function of the geometry of the true signal distribution, the geometry of the mismatched signal distributions as well as the interplay between such geometries, namely, the principal angles and the overlap between the true and the mismatched signal subspaces. Numerical results demonstrate that our conditions for reliable classification can sharply predict the behavior of a mismatched classifier both with synthetic data and in a motion segmentation and a hand-written digit classification applications.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present an algorithm for unconstrained face verification based on deep convolutional features and evaluate it on the newly released IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) dataset. The IJB-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces from 500 subjects with full pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the traditional Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) and Youtube Face (YTF) datasets. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is trained using the CASIA-WebFace dataset. Extensive experiments on the IJB-A dataset are provided.

- **Summary**: Class imbalance is a common problem in the case of real-world object detection and classification tasks. Data of some classes is abundant making them an over-represented majority, and data of other classes is scarce, making them an under-represented minority. This imbalance makes it challenging for a classifier to appropriately learn the discriminating boundaries of the majority and minority classes. In this work, we propose a cost sensitive deep neural network which can automatically learn robust feature representations for both the majority and minority classes. During training, our learning procedure jointly optimizes the class dependent costs and the neural network parameters. The proposed approach is applicable to both binary and multi-class problems without any modification. Moreover, as opposed to data level approaches, we do not alter the original data distribution which results in a lower computational cost during the training process. We report the results of our experiments on six major image classification datasets and show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms. Comparisons with popular data sampling techniques and cost sensitive classifiers demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: The recently presented COCO detection challenge will most probably be the reference benchmark in object detection in the next years. COCO is two orders of magnitude larger than Pascal and has four times the number of categories; so in all likelihood researchers will be faced with a number of new challenges. At this point, without any finished round of the competition, it is difficult for researchers to put their techniques in context, or in other words, to know how good their results are. In order to give a little context, this note evaluates a hypothetical object detector consisting in an oracle picking the best object proposal from a state-of-the-art technique. This oracle achieves a AP=0.292 in segmented objects and AP=0.317 in bounding boxes, showing that indeed the database is challenging, given that this value is the best one can expect if working on object proposals without refinement.

- **Summary**: We develop a lensless compressive imaging architecture, which consists of an aperture assembly and a single sensor, without using any lens. An anytime algorithm is proposed to reconstruct images from the compressive measurements; the algorithm produces a sequence of solutions that monotonically converge to the true signal (thus, anytime). The algorithm is developed based on the sparsity of local overlapping patches (in the transformation domain) and state-of-the-art results have been obtained. Experiments on real data demonstrate that encouraging results are obtained by measuring about 10% (of the image pixels) compressive measurements. The reconstruction results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the JPEG compression (based on file sizes) and the reconstructed image quality is close to the JPEG compression, in particular at a high compression rate.

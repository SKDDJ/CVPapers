- **Summary**: Monitoring the health of ancient artworks requires adequate prudence because of the sensitive nature of these materials. Classical techniques for identifying the development of faults rely on acoustic testing. These techniques, being invasive, may result in causing permanent damage to the material, especially if the material is inspected periodically. Non destructive testing has been carried out for different materials since long. In this regard, non-invasive systems were developed based on infrared thermometry principle to identify the faults in artworks. The test artwork is heated and the thermal response of the different layers is captured with the help of a thermal infrared camera. However, prolonged heating risks overheating and thus causing damage to artworks and an alternate approach is to use pseudo-random binary sequence excitations. The faults in the artwork, though, cannot be detected on the captured images, especially if their strength is weak. The weaker faults are either masked by the stronger ones, by the pictorial layer of the artwork or by the non-uniform heating. This work addresses the detection and localization of the faults through a wavelet based subspace decomposition scheme. The proposed scheme, on one hand, allows to remove the background while, on the other hand, removes the undesired high frequency noise. It is shown that the detection parameter is proportional to the diameter and the depth of the fault. A criterion is proposed to select the optimal wavelet basis along with suitable level selection for wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. The proposed approach is tested on a laboratory developed test sample with known fault locations and dimensions as well as real artworks. A comparison with a previously reported method demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach for fault detection in artworks.

- **Summary**: As research on action recognition matures, the focus is shifting away from categorizing basic task-oriented actions using hand-segmented video datasets to understanding complex goal-oriented daily human activities in real-world settings. Temporally structured models would seem obvious to tackle this set of problems, but so far, cases where these models have outperformed simpler unstructured bag-of-word types of models are scarce. With the increasing availability of large human activity datasets, combined with the development of novel feature coding techniques that yield more compact representations, it is time to revisit structured generative approaches.   Here, we describe an end-to-end generative approach from the encoding of features to the structural modeling of complex human activities by applying Fisher vectors and temporal models for the analysis of video sequences.   We systematically evaluate the proposed approach on several available datasets (ADL, MPIICooking, and Breakfast datasets) using a variety of performance metrics. Through extensive system evaluations, we demonstrate that combining compact video representations based on Fisher Vectors with HMM-based modeling yields very significant gains in accuracy and when properly trained with sufficient training samples, structured temporal models outperform unstructured bag-of-word types of models by a large margin on the tested performance metric.

- **Summary**: It is very useful and increasingly popular to extract accurate road centerlines from very-high-resolution (VHR) re- mote sensing imagery for various applications, such as road map generation and updating etc. There are three shortcomings of current methods: (a) Due to the noise and occlusions (owing to vehicles and trees), most road extraction methods bring in heterogeneous classification results; (b) Morphological thinning algorithm is widely used to extract road centerlines, while it pro- duces small spurs around the centerlines; (c) Many methods are ineffective to extract centerlines around the road intersections. To address the above three issues, we propose a novel method to ex- tract smooth and complete road centerlines via three techniques: the multiscale joint collaborative representation (MJCR) & graph cuts (GC), tensor voting (TV) & non-maximum suppression (NMS) and fitting based connection algorithm. Specifically, a MJCR-GC based road area segmentation method is proposed by incorporating mutiscale features and spatial information. In this way, a homogenous road segmentation result is achieved. Then, to obtain a smooth and correct road centerline network, a TV-NMS based centerline extraction method is introduced. This method not only extracts smooth road centerlines, but also connects the discontinuous road centerlines. Finally, to overcome the ineffectiveness of current methods in the road intersection, a fitting based road centerline connection algorithm is proposed. As a result, we can get a complete road centerline network. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher quantitative results, as well as more satisfactory visual performances by comparing with state-of-the- art methods.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel reflection color model consisting of body essence and (mixed) neuter, and present an effective method for separating dichromatic reflection components using a single image. Body essence is an entity invariant to interface reflection, and has two degrees of freedom unlike hue and maximum chromaticity. As a result, the proposed method is insensitive to noise and proper for colors around CMY (cyan, magenta, and yellow) as well as RGB (red, green, and blue), contrary to the maximum chromaticity-based methods. Interface reflection is separated by using a Gaussian function, which removes a critical thresholding problem. Furthermore, the method does not require any region segmentation. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed model and method.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel classifier learning algorithm to optimize a given nonlinear and nonsmoonth multivariate classifier performance measure. Moreover, to solve the problem of kernel function selection and kernel parameter tuning, we proposed to construct an optimal kernel by weighted linear combination of some candidate kernels. The learning of the classifier parameter and the kernel weight are unified in a single objective function considering to minimize the upper boundary of the given multivariate performance measure. The objective function is optimized with regard to classifier parameter and kernel weight alternately in an iterative algorithm by using cutting plane algorithm. The developed algorithm is evaluated on two different pattern classification methods with regard to various multivariate performance measure optimization problems. The experiment results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing methods.

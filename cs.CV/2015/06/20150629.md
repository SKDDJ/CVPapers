- **Summary**: High-resolution images can be used to resolve matching ambiguities between trajectory fragments (tracklets), which is one of the main challenges in multiple target tracking. A PTZ camera, which can pan, tilt and zoom, is a powerful and efficient tool that offers both close-up views and wide area coverage on demand. The wide-area view makes it possible to track many targets while the close-up view allows individuals to be identified from high-resolution images of their faces. A central component of a PTZ tracking system is a scheduling algorithm that determines which target to zoom in on.   In this paper we study this scheduling problem from a theoretical perspective, where the high resolution images are also used for tracklet matching. We propose a novel data structure, the Multi-Strand Tracking Graph (MSG), which represents the set of tracklets computed by a tracker and the possible associations between them. The MSG allows efficient scheduling as well as resolving -- directly or by elimination -- matching ambiguities between tracklets. The main feature of the MSG is the auxiliary data saved in each vertex, which allows efficient computation while avoiding time-consuming graph traversal. Synthetic data simulations are used to evaluate our scheduling algorithm and to demonstrate its superiority over a na\"ive one.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a framework for predicting kernelized classifiers in the visual domain for categories with no training images where the knowledge comes from textual description about these categories. Through our optimization framework, the proposed approach is capable of embedding the class-level knowledge from the text domain as kernel classifiers in the visual domain. We also proposed a distributional semantic kernel between text descriptions which is shown to be effective in our setting. The proposed framework is not restricted to textual descriptions, and can also be applied to other forms knowledge representations. Our approach was applied for the challenging task of zero-shot learning of fine-grained categories from text descriptions of these categories.

- **Summary**: We propose a Gaussian mixture model for background subtraction in infrared imagery. Following a Bayesian approach, our method automatically estimates the number of Gaussian components as well as their parameters, while simultaneously it avoids over/under fitting. The equations for estimating model parameters are analytically derived and thus our method does not require any sampling algorithm that is computationally and memory inefficient. The pixel density estimate is followed by an efficient and highly accurate updating mechanism, which permits our system to be automatically adapted to dynamically changing operation conditions. Experimental results and comparisons with other methods show that our method outperforms, in terms of precision and recall, while at the same time it keeps computational cost suitable for real-time applications.

- **Summary**: Quantitative analysis of channel networks plays an important role in river studies. To provide a quantitative representation of channel networks, we propose a new method that extracts channels from remotely sensed images and estimates their widths. Our fully automated method is based on a recently proposed Multiscale Singularity Index that responds strongly to curvilinear structures but weakly to edges. The algorithm produces a channel map, using a single image where water and non-water pixels have contrast, such as a Landsat near-infrared band image or a water index defined on multiple bands. The proposed method provides a robust alternative to the procedures that are used in remote sensing of fluvial geomorphology and makes classification and analysis of channel networks easier. The source code of the algorithm is available at: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/cne/.

- **Summary**: It is at times important to detect human presence automatically in secure environments. This needs a shape recognition algorithm that is robust, fast and has low error rates. The algorithm needs to process camera images quickly to detect any human in the range of vision, and generate alerts, especially if the object under scrutiny is moving in certain directions. We present here a simple, efficient and fast algorithm using skeletons of the images, and simple features like posture and length of the object.

- **Summary**: Sometimes a simple and fast algorithm is required to detect human presence and movement with a low error rate in a controlled environment for security purposes. Here a light weight algorithm has been presented that generates alert on detection of human presence and its movement towards a certain direction. The algorithm uses fixed angle CCTV camera images taken over time and relies upon skeleton transformation of successive images and calculation of difference in their coordinates.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a method to differentiate the foreground objects from the background of a color image. Firstly a color image of any size is input for processing. The algorithm converts it to a grayscale image. Next we apply canny edge detector to find the boundary of the foreground object. We concentrate to find the maximum distance between each boundary pixel column wise and row wise and we fill the region that is bound by the edges. Thus we are able to extract the grayscale values of pixels that are in the bounded region and convert the grayscale image back to original color image containing only the foreground object.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of motion synchronization (or averaging) and describes a simple, closed-form solution based on a spectral decomposition, which does not consider rotation and translation separately but works straight in SE(3), the manifold of rigid motions. Besides its theoretical interest, being the first closed form solution in SE(3), experimental results show that it compares favourably with the state of the art both in terms of precision and speed.

- **Summary**: Superior to state-of-the-art approaches which compete in table recognition with 67 annotated government reports in PDF format released by {\it ICDAR 2013 Table Competition}, this paper contributes a novel paradigm leveraging large-scale unlabeled PDF documents to open-domain table detection. We integrate the paradigm into our latest developed system ({\it PdfExtra}) to detect the region of tables by means of 9,466 academic articles from the entire repository of {\it ACL Anthology}, where almost all papers are archived by PDF format without annotation for tables. The paradigm first designs heuristics to automatically construct weakly labeled data. It then feeds diverse evidences, such as layouts of documents and linguistic features, which are extracted by {\it Apache PDFBox} and processed by {\it Stanford NLP} toolkit, into different canonical classifiers. We finally use these classifiers, i.e. {\it Naive Bayes}, {\it Logistic Regression} and {\it Support Vector Machine}, to collaboratively vote on the region of tables. Experimental results show that {\it PdfExtra} achieves a great leap forward, compared with the state-of-the-art approach. Moreover, we discuss the factors of different features, learning models and even domains of documents that may impact the performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our paradigm is compatible enough to leverage various features and learning models for open-domain table region detection within PDF files.

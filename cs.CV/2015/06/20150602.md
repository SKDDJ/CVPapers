- **Summary**: Can we develop a computer algorithm that assesses the creativity of a painting given its context within art history? This paper proposes a novel computational framework for assessing the creativity of creative products, such as paintings, sculptures, poetry, etc. We use the most common definition of creativity, which emphasizes the originality of the product and its influential value. The proposed computational framework is based on constructing a network between creative products and using this network to infer about the originality and influence of its nodes. Through a series of transformations, we construct a Creativity Implication Network. We show that inference about creativity in this network reduces to a variant of network centrality problems which can be solved efficiently. We apply the proposed framework to the task of quantifying creativity of paintings (and sculptures). We experimented on two datasets with over 62K paintings to illustrate the behavior of the proposed framework. We also propose a methodology for quantitatively validating the results of the proposed algorithm, which we call the "time machine experiment".

- **Summary**: We reconstruct a controllable model of a person from a large photo collection that captures his or her {\em persona}, i.e., physical appearance and behavior. The ability to operate on unstructured photo collections enables modeling a huge number of people, including celebrities and other well photographed people without requiring them to be scanned. Moreover, we show the ability to drive or {\em puppeteer} the captured person B using any other video of a different person A. In this scenario, B acts out the role of person A, but retains his/her own personality and character. Our system is based on a novel combination of 3D face reconstruction, tracking, alignment, and multi-texture modeling, applied to the puppeteering problem. We demonstrate convincing results on a large variety of celebrities derived from Internet imagery and video.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce an optimum approach for querying similar images on large digital-image databases. Our work is based on RBIR (region-based image retrieval) method which uses multiple regions as the key to retrieval images. This method significantly improves the accuracy of queries. However, this also increases the cost of computing. To reduce this expensive computational cost, we implement binary signature encoder which maps an image to its identification in binary. In order to fasten the lookup, binary signatures of images are classified by the help of S-kGraph. Finally, our work is evaluated on COREL's images.

- **Summary**: With the advent of remote sensing satellites, a huge repository of remotely sensed images is available. Change detection in remotely sensed images has been an active research area as it helps us understand the transitions that are taking place on the Earths surface. This paper discusses the methods and their classifications proposed by various researchers for change detection. Since use of soft computing based techniques are now very popular among research community, this paper also presents a classification based on learning techniques used in soft-computing methods for change detection.

### Facial Expressions Tracking and Recognition: Database Protocols for Systems Validation and Evaluation

- **Summary**: Each human face is unique. It has its own shape, topology, and distinguishing features. As such, developing and testing facial tracking systems are challenging tasks. The existing face recognition and tracking algorithms in Computer Vision mainly specify concrete situations according to particular goals and applications, requiring validation methodologies with data that fits their purposes. However, a database that covers all possible variations of external and factors does not exist, increasing researchers' work in acquiring their own data or compiling groups of databases.   To address this shortcoming, we propose a methodology for facial data acquisition through definition of fundamental variables, such as subject characteristics, acquisition hardware, and performance parameters. Following this methodology, we also propose two protocols that allow the capturing of facial behaviors under uncontrolled and real-life situations. As validation, we executed both protocols which lead to creation of two sample databases: FdMiee (Facial database with Multi input, expressions, and environments) and FACIA (Facial Multimodal database driven by emotional induced acting).   Using different types of hardware, FdMiee captures facial information under environmental and facial behaviors variations. FACIA is an extension of FdMiee introducing a pipeline to acquire additional facial behaviors and speech using an emotion-acting method. Therefore, this work eases the creation of adaptable database according to algorithm's requirements and applications, leading to simplified validation and testing processes.

- **Summary**: A neuromorphic chip that combines CMOS analog spiking neurons and memristive synapses offers a promising solution to brain-inspired computing, as it can provide massive neural network parallelism and density. Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive computing.

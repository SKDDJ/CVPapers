- **Summary**: We propose a Bayesian approach to learn discriminative dictionaries for sparse representation of data. The proposed approach infers probability distributions over the atoms of a discriminative dictionary using a Beta Process. It also computes sets of Bernoulli distributions that associate class labels to the learned dictionary atoms. This association signifies the selection probabilities of the dictionary atoms in the expansion of class-specific data. Furthermore, the non-parametric character of the proposed approach allows it to infer the correct size of the dictionary. We exploit the aforementioned Bernoulli distributions in separately learning a linear classifier. The classifier uses the same hierarchical Bayesian model as the dictionary, which we present along the analytical inference solution for Gibbs sampling. For classification, a test instance is first sparsely encoded over the learned dictionary and the codes are fed to the classifier. We performed experiments for face and action recognition; and object and scene-category classification using five public datasets and compared the results with state-of-the-art discriminative sparse representation approaches. Experiments show that the proposed Bayesian approach consistently outperforms the existing approaches.

- **Summary**: In light-sheet microscopy, overall image content and resolution are improved by acquiring and fusing multiple views of the sample from different directions. State-of-the-art multi-view (MV) deconvolution employs the point spread functions (PSF) of the different views to simultaneously fuse and deconvolve the images in 3D, but processing takes a multiple of the acquisition time and constitutes the bottleneck in the imaging pipeline. Here we show that MV deconvolution in 3D can finally be achieved in real-time by reslicing the acquired data and processing cross-sectional planes individually on the massively parallel architecture of a graphics processing unit (GPU).

- **Summary**: There is physiological evidence that our ability to interpret human pose and action from 2D visual imagery (binocular or monocular) engages the circuitry of the motor cortices as well as the visual areas of the brain. This implies that the capability of the motor cortices to solve inverse kinematics is flexible enough to apply to both motion planning as well as serving as a generative model for the visual processing of human figures, despite the differing functional requirements of the two tasks. This paper provides a computational model of the cooperation between visual and motor areas: in other words, a system view of an important class of brain computations. The model unifies the solution of the separate inverse problems involved in the task, visual transformation discovery, inverse kinematics, and adaptation to morphology variations, using several instances of the Map-seeking Circuit algorithm. While the paper is weighted toward the exposition of a neurobiological hypothesis, from mathematical formalization of the problem to neuronal circuitry, the algorithmic expression of the solution is also a functional machine vision system for human figure recognition, and 3D pose and body morphology reconstruction from monocular, perspective-less input imagery. With an inverse kinematic generative model capable of imposing a variety of endogenous and exogenous constraints the machine vision implementation acquires characteristics currently unique among such systems.

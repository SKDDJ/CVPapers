- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel error measure to compare a segmentation against ground truth. This measure, which we call Tolerant Edit Distance (TED), is motivated by two observations: (1) Some errors, like small boundary shifts, are tolerable in practice. Which errors are tolerable is application dependent and should be a parameter of the measure. (2) Non-tolerable errors have to be corrected manually. The time needed to do so should be reflected by the error measure. Using integer linear programming, the TED finds the minimal weighted sum of split and merge errors exceeding a given tolerance criterion, and thus provides a time-to-fix estimate. In contrast to commonly used measures like Rand index or variation of information, the TED (1) does not count small, but tolerable, differences, (2) provides intuitive numbers, (3) gives a time-to-fix estimate, and (4) can localize and classify the type of errors. By supporting both isotropic and anisotropic volumes and having a flexible tolerance criterion, the TED can be adapted to different requirements. On example segmentations for 3D neuron segmentation, we demonstrate that the TED is capable of counting topological errors, while ignoring small boundary shifts.

- **Summary**: Saturation affects a significant rate of images recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. This paper describes a computational method and a technological pipeline for the de-saturation of such images, based on several mathematical ingredients like Expectation Maximization, image correlation and interpolation. An analysis of the computational properties and demands of the pipeline, together with an assessment of its reliability are performed against a set of data recorded from the Feburary 25 2014 flaring event.

- **Summary**: Virality of online content on social networking websites is an important but esoteric phenomenon often studied in fields like marketing, psychology and data mining. In this paper we study viral images from a computer vision perspective. We introduce three new image datasets from Reddit, and define a virality score using Reddit metadata. We train classifiers with state-of-the-art image features to predict virality of individual images, relative virality in pairs of images, and the dominant topic of a viral image. We also compare machine performance to human performance on these tasks. We find that computers perform poorly with low level features, and high level information is critical for predicting virality. We encode semantic information through relative attributes. We identify the 5 key visual attributes that correlate with virality. We create an attribute-based characterization of images that can predict relative virality with 68.10% accuracy (SVM+Deep Relative Attributes) -- better than humans at 60.12%. Finally, we study how human prediction of image virality varies with different `contexts' in which the images are viewed, such as the influence of neighbouring images, images recently viewed, as well as the image title or caption. This work is a first step in understanding the complex but important phenomenon of image virality. Our datasets and annotations will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel fitting method that uses local image features to fit a 3D Morphable Model to 2D images. To overcome the obstacle of optimising a cost function that contains a non-differentiable feature extraction operator, we use a learning-based cascaded regression method that learns the gradient direction from data. The method allows to simultaneously solve for shape and pose parameters. Our method is thoroughly evaluated on Morphable Model generated data and first results on real data are presented. Compared to traditional fitting methods, which use simple raw features like pixel colour or edge maps, local features have been shown to be much more robust against variations in imaging conditions. Our approach is unique in that we are the first to use local features to fit a Morphable Model.   Because of the speed of our method, it is applicable for realtime applications. Our cascaded regression framework is available as an open source library (https://github.com/patrikhuber).

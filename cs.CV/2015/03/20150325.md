- **Summary**: We propose a new way of incorporating temporal information present in videos into Spatial Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) trained on images, that avoids training Spatio-Temporal ConvNets from scratch. We describe several initializations of weights in 3D Convolutional Layers of Spatio-Temporal ConvNet using 2D Convolutional Weights learned from ImageNet. We show that it is important to initialize 3D Convolutional Weights judiciously in order to learn temporal representations of videos. We evaluate our methods on the UCF-101 dataset and demonstrate improvement over Spatial ConvNets.

- **Summary**: Edge preserving filters preserve the edges and its information while blurring an image. In other words they are used to smooth an image, while reducing the edge blurring effects across the edge like halos, phantom etc. They are nonlinear in nature. Examples are bilateral filter, anisotropic diffusion filter, guided filter, trilateral filter etc. Hence these family of filters are very useful in reducing the noise in an image making it very demanding in computer vision and computational photography applications like denoising, video abstraction, demosaicing, optical-flow estimation, stereo matching, tone mapping, style transfer, relighting etc. This paper provides a concrete introduction to edge preserving filters starting from the heat diffusion equation in olden to recent eras, an overview of its numerous applications, as well as mathematical analysis, various efficient and optimized ways of implementation and their interrelationships, keeping focus on preserving the boundaries, spikes and canyons in presence of noise. Furthermore it provides a realistic notion for efficient implementation with a research scope for hardware realization for further acceleration.

- **Summary**: This paper presents modification of the TwIST algorithm for Compressive Sensing MRI images reconstruction. Compressive Sensing is new approach in signal processing whose basic idea is recovering signal form small set of available samples. The application of the Compressive Sensing in biomedical imaging has found great importance. It allows significant lowering of the acquisition time, and therefore, save the patient from the negative impact of the MR apparatus. TwIST is commonly used algorithm for 2D signals reconstruction using Compressive Sensing principle. It is based on the Total Variation minimization. Standard version of the TwIST uses masked 2D Discrete Fourier Transform coefficients as Compressive Sensing measurements. In this paper, different masks and different transformation domains for coefficients selection are tested. Certain percent of the measurements is used from the mask, as well as small number of coefficients outside the mask. Comparative analysis using 2D DFT and 2D DCT coefficients, with different mask shapes is performed. The theory is proved with experimental results.

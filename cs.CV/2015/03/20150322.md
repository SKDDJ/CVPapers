- **Summary**: In this work we address the problem of real-time dynamic MRI reconstruction. There are a handful of studies on this topic; these techniques are either based on compressed sensing or employ Kalman Filtering. These techniques cannot achieve the reconstruction speed necessary for real-time reconstruction. In this work, we propose a new approach to MRI reconstruction. We learn a non-linear mapping from the unstructured aliased images to the corresponding clean images using a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE). The training for SDAE is slow, but the reconstruction is very fast - only requiring a few matrix vector multiplications. In this work, we have shown that using SDAE one can reconstruct the MRI frame faster than the data acquisition rate, thereby achieving real-time reconstruction. The quality of reconstruction is of the same order as a previous compressed sensing based online reconstruction technique.

- **Summary**: While data has certainly taken the center stage in computer vision in recent years, it can still be difficult to obtain in certain scenarios. In particular, acquiring ground truth 3D shapes of objects pictured in 2D images remains a challenging feat and this has hampered progress in recognition-based object reconstruction from a single image. Here we propose to bypass previous solutions such as 3D scanning or manual design, that scale poorly, and instead populate object category detection datasets semi-automatically with dense, per-object 3D reconstructions, bootstrapped from:(i) class labels, (ii) ground truth figure-ground segmentations and (iii) a small set of keypoint annotations. Our proposed algorithm first estimates camera viewpoint using rigid structure-from-motion and then reconstructs object shapes by optimizing over visual hull proposals guided by loose within-class shape similarity assumptions. The visual hull sampling process attempts to intersect an object's projection cone with the cones of minimal subsets of other similar objects among those pictured from certain vantage points. We show that our method is able to produce convincing per-object 3D reconstructions and to accurately estimate cameras viewpoints on one of the most challenging existing object-category detection datasets, PASCAL VOC. We hope that our results will re-stimulate interest on joint object recognition and 3D reconstruction from a single image.

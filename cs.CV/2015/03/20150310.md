- **Summary**: We discuss several strategies to implement Dykstra's projection algorithm on NVIDIA's compute unified device architecture (CUDA). Dykstra's algorithm is the central step in and the computationally most expensive part of statistical multi-resolution methods. It projects a given vector onto the intersection of convex sets. Compared with a CPU implementation our CUDA implementation is one order of magnitude faster. For a further speed up and to reduce memory consumption we have developed a new variant, which we call incomplete Dykstra's algorithm. Implemented in CUDA it is one order of magnitude faster than the CUDA implementation of the standard Dykstra algorithm. As sample application we discuss using the incomplete Dykstra's algorithm as preprocessor for the recently developed super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) method (Dertinger et al. 2009). We show that statistical multi-resolution estimation can enhance the resolution improvement of the plain SOFI algorithm just as the Fourier-reweighting of SOFI. The results are compared in terms of their power spectrum and their Fourier ring correlation (Saxton and Baumeister 1982). The Fourier ring correlation indicates that the resolution for typical second order SOFI images can be improved by about 30 per cent. Our results show that a careful parallelization of Dykstra's algorithm enables its use in large-scale statistical multi-resolution analyses.

- **Summary**: Objective: Improve the reconstructed image with fast and multi-class dictionaries learning when magnetic resonance imaging is accelerated by undersampling the k-space data. Methods: A fast orthogonal dictionary learning method is introduced into magnetic resonance image reconstruction to providing adaptive sparse representation of images. To enhance the sparsity, image is divided into classified patches according to the same geometrical direction and dictionary is trained within each class. A new sparse reconstruction model with the multi-class dictionaries is proposed and solved using a fast alternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Experiments on phantom and brain imaging data with acceleration factor up to 10 and various undersampling patterns are conducted. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art magnetic resonance image reconstruction methods. Conclusion: Artifacts are better suppressed and image edges are better preserved than the compared methods. Besides, the computation of the proposed approach is much faster than the typical K-SVD dictionary learning method in magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Significance: The proposed method can be exploited in undersapmled magnetic resonance imaging to reduce data acquisition time and reconstruct images with better image quality.

- **Summary**: We address the problem of efficient sparse fixed-rank (S-FR) matrix decomposition, i.e., splitting a corrupted matrix $M$ into an uncorrupted matrix $L$ of rank $r$ and a sparse matrix of outliers $S$. Fixed-rank constraints are usually imposed by the physical restrictions of the system under study. Here we propose a method to perform accurate and very efficient S-FR decomposition that is more suitable for large-scale problems than existing approaches. Our method is a grateful combination of geometrical and algebraical techniques, which avoids the bottleneck caused by the Truncated SVD (TSVD). Instead, a polar factorization is used to exploit the manifold structure of fixed-rank problems as the product of two Stiefel and an SPD manifold, leading to a better convergence and stability. Then, closed-form projectors help to speed up each iteration of the method. We introduce a novel and fast projector for the $\text{SPD}$ manifold and a proof of its validity. Further acceleration is achieved using a Nystrom scheme. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real data in the context of robust photometric stereo and spectral clustering show that our proposals outperform the state of the art.

- **Summary**: We present and explore in detail a pair of digital images with $c_u$-adjacencies that are homotopic but not pointed homotopic. For two digital loops $f,g: [0,m]_Z \rightarrow X$ with the same basepoint, we introduce the notion of {\em tight at the basepoint (TAB)} pointed homotopy, which is more restrictive than ordinary pointed homotopy and yields some different results.   We present a variant form of the digital fundamental group. Based on what we call {\em eventually constant} loops, this version of the fundamental group is equivalent to that of Boxer (1999), but offers the advantage that eventually constant maps are often easier to work with than the trivial extensions that are key to the development of the fundamental group in Boxer (1999) and many subsequent papers.   We show that homotopy equivalent digital images have isomorphic fundamental groups, even when the homotopy equivalence does not preserve the basepoint. This assertion appeared in Boxer (2005), but there was an error in the proof; here, we correct the error.

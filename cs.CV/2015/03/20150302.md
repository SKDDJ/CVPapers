- **Summary**: Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) refers to matching face images acquired from different sources (i.e., different sensors or different wavelengths) for identification. HFR plays an important role in both biometrics research and industry. In spite of promising progresses achieved in recent years, HFR is still a challenging problem due to the difficulty to represent two heterogeneous images in a homogeneous manner. Existing HFR methods either represent an image ignoring the spatial information, or rely on a transformation procedure which complicates the recognition task. Considering these problems, we propose a novel graphical representation based HFR method (G-HFR) in this paper. Markov networks are employed to represent heterogeneous image patches separately, which takes the spatial compatibility between neighboring image patches into consideration. A coupled representation similarity metric (CRSM) is designed to measure the similarity between obtained graphical representations. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple HFR scenarios (viewed sketch, forensic sketch, near infrared image, and thermal infrared image) show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces matrix product state (MPS) decomposition as a computational tool for extracting features of multidimensional data represented by higher-order tensors. Regardless of tensor order, MPS extracts its relevant features to the so-called core tensor of maximum order three which can be used for classification. Mainly based on a successive sequence of singular value decompositions (SVD), MPS is quite simple to implement without any recursive procedure needed for optimizing local tensors. Thus, it leads to substantial computational savings compared to other tensor feature extraction methods such as higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) underlying the Tucker decomposition (TD). Benchmark results show that MPS can reduce significantly the feature space of data while achieving better classification performance compared to HOOI.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation aims at training a classifier in one dataset and applying it to a related but not identical dataset. One successfully used framework of domain adaptation is to learn a transformation to match both the distribution of the features (marginal distribution), and the distribution of the labels given features (conditional distribution). In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation framework named Deep Transfer Network (DTN), where the highly flexible deep neural networks are used to implement such a distribution matching process.   This is achieved by two types of layers in DTN: the shared feature extraction layers which learn a shared feature subspace in which the marginal distributions of the source and the target samples are drawn close, and the discrimination layers which match conditional distributions by classifier transduction. We also show that DTN has a computation complexity linear to the number of training samples, making it suitable to large-scale problems. By combining the best paradigms in both worlds (deep neural networks in recognition, and matching marginal and conditional distributions in domain adaptation), we demonstrate by extensive experiments that DTN improves significantly over former methods in both execution time and classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the problem of estimating and removing non-uniform motion blur from a single blurry image. We propose a deep learning approach to predicting the probabilistic distribution of motion blur at the patch level using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We further extend the candidate set of motion kernels predicted by the CNN using carefully designed image rotations. A Markov random field model is then used to infer a dense non-uniform motion blur field enforcing motion smoothness. Finally, motion blur is removed by a non-uniform deblurring model using patch-level image prior. Experimental evaluations show that our approach can effectively estimate and remove complex non-uniform motion blur that is not handled well by previous approaches.

- **Summary**: A natural way to characterize the cluster structure of a dataset is by finding regions containing a high density of data. This can be done in a nonparametric way with a kernel density estimate, whose modes and hence clusters can be found using mean-shift algorithms. We describe the theory and practice behind clustering based on kernel density estimates and mean-shift algorithms. We discuss the blurring and non-blurring versions of mean-shift; theoretical results about mean-shift algorithms and Gaussian mixtures; relations with scale-space theory, spectral clustering and other algorithms; extensions to tracking, to manifold and graph data, and to manifold denoising; K-modes and Laplacian K-modes algorithms; acceleration strategies for large datasets; and applications to image segmentation, manifold denoising and multivalued regression.

- **Summary**: We propose regularization schemes for deformable registration and efficient algorithms for their numerical approximation. We treat image registration as a variational optimal control problem. The deformation map is parametrized by its velocity. Tikhonov regularization ensures well-posedness. Our scheme augments standard smoothness regularization operators based on $H^1$- and $H^2$-seminorms with a constraint on the divergence of the velocity field, which resembles variational formulations for Stokes incompressible flows. In our formulation, we invert for a stationary velocity field and a mass source map. This allows us to explicitly control the compressibility of the deformation map and by that the determinant of the deformation gradient. We also introduce a new regularization scheme that allows us to control shear. We use a globalized, preconditioned, matrix-free, reduced space (Gauss--)Newton--Krylov scheme for numerical optimization. We exploit variable elimination techniques to reduce the number of unknowns of our system; we only iterate on the reduced space of the velocity field. Our current implementation is limited to the two-dimensional case. The numerical experiments demonstrate that we can control the determinant of the deformation gradient without compromising registration quality. This additional control allows us to avoid oversmoothing of the deformation map. We also demonstrate that we can promote or penalize shear while controlling the determinant of the deformation gradient.

- **Summary**: When the boundary of a familiar object is shown by a series of isolated dots, humans can often recognize the object with ease. This ability can be sustained with addition of distracting dots around the object. However, such capability has not been reproduced algorithmically on computers. We introduce a new algorithm that groups a set of dots into multiple non-disjoint subsets. It connects the dots into a spanning tree using the proximity cue. It then applies the straight polygon transformation to an initial polygon derived from the spanning tree. The straight polygon divides the space into polygons recursively and each polygon can be viewed as grouping of a subset of the dots. The number of polygons generated is O($n$). We also introduce simple shape selection and recognition algorithms that can be applied to the grouping result. We used both natural and synthetic images to show effectiveness of these algorithms.

- **Summary**: We present a method for calibrating the Ensemble of Exemplar SVMs model. Unlike the standard approach, which calibrates each SVM independently, our method optimizes their joint performance as an ensemble. We formulate joint calibration as a constrained optimization problem and devise an efficient optimization algorithm to find its global optimum. The algorithm dynamically discards parts of the solution space that cannot contain the optimum early on, making the optimization computationally feasible. We experiment with EE-SVM trained on state-of-the-art CNN descriptors. Results on the ILSVRC 2014 and PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets show that (i) our joint calibration procedure outperforms independent calibration on the task of classifying windows as belonging to an object class or not; and (ii) this improved window classifier leads to better performance on the object detection task.

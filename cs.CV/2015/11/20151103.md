- **Summary**: Traditional stereo algorithms have focused their efforts on reconstruction quality and have largely avoided prioritizing for run time performance. Robots, on the other hand, require quick maneuverability and effective computation to observe its immediate environment and perform tasks within it. In this work, we propose a high-performance and tunable stereo disparity estimation method, with a peak frame-rate of 120Hz (VGA resolution, on a single CPU-thread), that can potentially enable robots to quickly reconstruct their immediate surroundings and maneuver at high-speeds. Our key contribution is a disparity estimation algorithm that iteratively approximates the scene depth via a piece-wise planar mesh from stereo imagery, with a fast depth validation step for semi-dense reconstruction. The mesh is initially seeded with sparsely matched keypoints, and is recursively tessellated and refined as needed (via a resampling stage), to provide the desired stereo disparity accuracy. The inherent simplicity and speed of our approach, with the ability to tune it to a desired reconstruction quality and runtime performance makes it a compelling solution for applications in high-speed vehicles.

- **Summary**: One of the most fundamental concepts in statistics is the concept of sample mean. Properties of the sample mean that are well-defined in Euclidean spaces become unwieldy or even unclear in graph spaces. Open problems related to the sample mean of graphs include: non-existence, non-uniqueness, statistical inconsistency, lack of convergence results of mean algorithms, non-existence of midpoints, and disparity to midpoints. We present conditions to resolve all six problems and propose a Majorize-Minimize-Mean (MMM) Algorithm. Experiments on graph datasets representing images and molecules show that the MMM-Algorithm best approximates a sample mean of graphs compared to six other mean algorithms.

- **Summary**: Recent works have highlighted scale invariance or symmetry present in the weight space of a typical deep network and the adverse effect it has on the Euclidean gradient based stochastic gradient descent optimization. In this work, we show that a commonly used deep network, which uses convolution, batch normalization, reLU, max-pooling, and sub-sampling pipeline, possess more complex forms of symmetry arising from scaling-based reparameterization of the network weights. We propose to tackle the issue of the weight space symmetry by constraining the filters to lie on the unit-norm manifold. Consequently, training the network boils down to using stochastic gradient descent updates on the unit-norm manifold. Our empirical evidence based on the MNIST dataset shows that the proposed updates improve the test performance beyond what is achieved with batch normalization and without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the weight updates.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal image registration is a challenging task that is vital to fuse complementary signals for subsequent analyses. Despite much research into cost functions addressing this challenge, there exist cases in which these are ineffective. In this work, we show that (1) this is true for the registration of in-vivo Drosophila brain volumes visualizing genetically encoded calcium indicators to an nc82 atlas and (2) that machine learning based contrast synthesis can yield improvements. More specifically, the number of subjects for which the registration outright failed was greatly reduced (from 40% to 15%) by using a synthesized image.

- **Summary**: We tackle the problem of getting a full 6-DOF pose estimation of a query image inside a given point cloud. This technical report re-evaluates the algorithms proposed by Y. Li et al. "Worldwide Pose Estimation using 3D Point Cloud". Our code computes poses from 3 or 4 points, with both known and unknown focal length. The results can easily be displayed and analyzed with Meshlab. We found both advantages and shortcomings of the methods proposed. Furthermore, additional priors and parameters for point selection, RANSAC and pose quality estimate (inlier test) are proposed and applied.

- **Summary**: Motivation: Serial section microscopy is an established method for detailed anatomy reconstruction of biological specimen. During the last decade, high resolution electron microscopy (EM) of serial sections has become the de-facto standard for reconstruction of neural connectivity at ever increasing scales (EM connectomics). In serial section microscopy, the axial dimension of the volume is sampled by physically removing thin sections from the embedded specimen and subsequently imaging either the block-face or the section series. This process has limited precision leading to inhomogeneous non-planar sampling of the axial dimension of the volume which, in turn, results in distorted image volumes. This includes that section series may be collected and imaged in unknown order.   Results: We developed methods to identify and correct these distortions through image-based signal analysis without any additional physical apparatus or measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in proof of principle experiments and application to real world problems.   Availability and Implementation: We made our work available as libraries for the ImageJ distribution Fiji and for deployment in a high performance parallel computing environment.

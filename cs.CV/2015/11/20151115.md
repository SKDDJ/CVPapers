- **Summary**: In remote sensing, images acquired by various earth observation satellites tend to have either a high spatial and low spectral resolution or vice versa. Pansharpening is a technique which aims to improve spatial resolution of multispectral image. The challenges involve in the pansharpening are not only to improve the spatial resolution but also to preserve spectral quality of the multispectral image. In this paper, various pansharpening algorithms are discussed and classified based on approaches they have adopted. Using MATLAB image processing toolbox, several state-of-art pan-sharpening algorithms are implemented. Quality of pansharpened images are assessed visually and quantitatively. Correlation coefficient (CC), Root mean square error (RMSE), Relative average spectral error (RASE) and Universal quality index (Q) indices are used to easure spectral quality while to spatial-CC (SCC) quantitative parameter is used for spatial quality measurement. Finally, the paper is concluded with useful remarks.

- **Summary**: Autonomous indoor navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) possesses many challenges. One main reason is that GPS has limited precision in indoor environments. The additional fact that MAVs are not able to carry heavy weight or power consuming sensors, such as range finders, makes indoor autonomous navigation a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a practical system in which a quadcopter autonomously navigates indoors and finds a specific target, i.e., a book bag, by using a single camera. A deep learning model, Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet), is used to learn a controller strategy that mimics an expert pilot's choice of action. We show our system's performance through real-time experiments in diverse indoor locations. To understand more about our trained network, we use several visualization techniques.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Video Question Answering in temporal domain to infer the past, describe the present and predict the future. We present an encoder-decoder approach using Recurrent Neural Networks to learn temporal structures of videos and introduce a dual-channel ranking loss to answer multiple-choice questions. We explore approaches for finer understanding of video content using question form of "fill-in-the-blank", and managed to collect 109,895 video clips with duration over 1,000 hours from TACoS, MPII-MD, MEDTest 14 datasets, while the corresponding 390,744 questions are generated from annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the compared baselines.

- **Summary**: Semi-inner-products in the sense of Lumer are extended to convex functionals. This yields a Hilbert-space like structure to convex functionals in Banach spaces. In particular, a general expression for semi-inner-products with respect to one homogeneous functionals is given. Thus one can use the new operator for the analysis of total variation and higher order functionals like total-generalized-variation (TGV). Having a semi-inner-product, an angle between functions can be defined in a straightforward manner. It is shown that in the one homogeneous case the Bregman distance can be expressed in terms of this newly defined angle. In addition, properties of the semi-inner-product of nonlinear eigenfunctions induced by the functional are derived. We use this construction to state a sufficient condition for a perfect decomposition of two signals and suggest numerical measures which indicate when those conditions are approximately met.

- **Summary**: In this paper we introduce a novel notion of separation surfaces for image decomposition. A surface is embedded in the spectral total-variation (TV) three dimensional domain and encodes a spatially-varying separation scale. The method allows good separation of textures with gradually varying pattern-size, pattern-contrast or illumination. The recently proposed total variation spectral framework is used to decompose the image into a continuum of textural scales. A desired texture, within a scale range, is found by fitting a surface to the local maximal responses in the spectral domain. A band above and below the surface, referred to as the \textit{Texture Stratum}, defines for each pixel the adaptive scale-range of the texture. Based on the decomposition an application is proposed which can attenuate or enhance textures in the image in a very natural and visually convincing manner.

- **Summary**: We consider the problem of recovering a complete (i.e., square and invertible) matrix $\mathbf A_0$, from $\mathbf Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ with $\mathbf Y = \mathbf A_0 \mathbf X_0$, provided $\mathbf X_0$ is sufficiently sparse. This recovery problem is central to theoretical understanding of dictionary learning, which seeks a sparse representation for a collection of input signals and finds numerous applications in modern signal processing and machine learning. We give the first efficient algorithm that provably recovers $\mathbf A_0$ when $\mathbf X_0$ has $O(n)$ nonzeros per column, under suitable probability model for $\mathbf X_0$.   Our algorithmic pipeline centers around solving a certain nonconvex optimization problem with a spherical constraint, and hence is naturally phrased in the language of manifold optimization. In a companion paper (arXiv:1511.03607), we have showed that with high probability our nonconvex formulation has no "spurious" local minimizers and around any saddle point the objective function has a negative directional curvature. In this paper, we take advantage of the particular geometric structure, and describe a Riemannian trust region algorithm that provably converges to a local minimizer with from arbitrary initializations. Such minimizers give excellent approximations to rows of $\mathbf X_0$. The rows are then recovered by linear programming rounding and deflation.

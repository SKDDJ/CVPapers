- **Summary**: Neural networks are becoming central in several areas of computer vision and image processing and different architectures have been proposed to solve specific problems. The impact of the loss layer of neural networks, however, has not received much attention in the context of image processing: the default and virtually only choice is L2. In this paper, we bring attention to alternative choices for image restoration. In particular, we show the importance of perceptually-motivated losses when the resulting image is to be evaluated by a human observer. We compare the performance of several losses, and propose a novel, differentiable error function. We show that the quality of the results improves significantly with better loss functions, even when the network architecture is left unchanged.

- **Summary**: The introduction of consumer RGB-D scanners set off a major boost in 3D computer vision research. Yet, the precision of existing depth scanners is not accurate enough to recover fine details of a scanned object. While modern shading based depth refinement methods have been proven to work well with Lambertian objects, they break down in the presence of specularities. We present a novel shape from shading framework that addresses this issue and enhances both diffuse and specular objects' depth profiles. We take advantage of the built-in monochromatic IR projector and IR images of the RGB-D scanners and present a lighting model that accounts for the specular regions in the input image. Using this model, we reconstruct the depth map in real-time. Both quantitative tests and visual evaluations prove that the proposed method produces state of the art depth reconstruction results.

- **Summary**: It is no secret that pornographic material is now a one-click-away from everyone, including children and minors. General social media networks are striving to isolate adult images and videos from normal ones. Intelligent image analysis methods can help to automatically detect and isolate questionable images in media. Unfortunately, these methods require vast experience to design the classifier including one or more of the popular computer vision feature descriptors. We propose to build a classifier based on one of the recently flourishing deep learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks contain many layers for both automatic features extraction and classification. The benefit is an easier system to build (no need for hand-crafting features and classifiers). Additionally, our experiments show that it is even more accurate than the state of the art methods on the most recent benchmark dataset.

- **Summary**: Multi-object tracking remains challenging due to frequent occurrence of occlusions and outliers. In order to handle this problem, we propose an Approximation-Shrink Scheme for sequential optimization. This scheme is realized by introducing an Ambiguity-Clearness Graph to avoid conflicts and maintain sequence independent, as well as a sliding window optimization framework to constrain the size of state space and guarantee convergence. Based on this window-wise framework, the states of targets are clustered in a self-organizing manner. Moreover, we show that the traditional online and batch tracking methods can be embraced by the window-wise framework. Experiments indicate that with only a small window, the optimization performance can be much better than online methods and approach to batch methods.

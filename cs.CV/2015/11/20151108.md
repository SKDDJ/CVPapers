- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel face dataset with attractiveness ratings, namely, the SCUT-FBP dataset, is developed for automatic facial beauty perception. This dataset provides a benchmark to evaluate the performance of different methods for facial attractiveness prediction, including the state-of-the-art deep learning method. The SCUT-FBP dataset contains face portraits of 500 Asian female subjects with attractiveness ratings, all of which have been verified in terms of rating distribution, standard deviation, consistency, and self-consistency. Benchmark evaluations for facial attractiveness prediction were performed with different combinations of facial geometrical features and texture features using classical statistical learning methods and the deep learning method. The best Pearson correlation (0.8187) was achieved by the CNN model. Thus, the results of our experiments indicate that the SCUT-FBP dataset provides a reliable benchmark for facial beauty perception.

- **Summary**: Logo detection from images has many applications, particularly for brand recognition and intellectual property protection. Most existing studies for logo recognition and detection are based on small-scale datasets which are not comprehensive enough when exploring emerging deep learning techniques. In this paper, we introduce "LOGO-Net", a large-scale logo image database for logo detection and brand recognition from real-world product images. To facilitate research, LOGO-Net has two datasets: (i)"logos-18" consists of 18 logo classes, 10 brands, and 16,043 logo objects, and (ii) "logos-160" consists of 160 logo classes, 100 brands, and 130,608 logo objects. We describe the ideas and challenges for constructing such a large-scale database. Another key contribution of this work is to apply emerging deep learning techniques for logo detection and brand recognition tasks, and conduct extensive experiments by exploring several state-of-the-art deep region-based convolutional networks techniques for object detection tasks. The LOGO-net will be released at http://logo-net.org/

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a deep leaning method to address the challenging facial attractiveness prediction problem. The method constructs a convolutional neural network of facial beauty prediction using a new deep cascaded fine-turning scheme with various face inputting channels, such as the original RGB face image, the detail layer image, and the lighting layer image. With a carefully designed CNN model of deep structure, large input size and small convolutional kernels, we have achieved a high prediction correlation of 0.88. This result convinces us that the problem of facial attractiveness prediction can be solved by deep learning approach, and it also shows the important roles of the facial smoothness, lightness, and color information that were involved in facial beauty perception, which is consistent with the result of recent psychology studies. Furthermore, we analyze the high-level features learnt by CNN through visualization of its hidden layers, and some interesting phenomena were observed. It is found that the contours and appearance of facial features, especially eyes and moth, are the most significant facial attributes for facial attractiveness prediction, which is also consistent with the visual perception intuition of human.

- **Summary**: This paper aims for event recognition when video examples are scarce or even completely absent. The key in such a challenging setting is a semantic video representation. Rather than building the representation from individual attribute detectors and their annotations, we propose to learn the entire representation from freely available web videos and their descriptions using an embedding between video features and term vectors. In our proposed embedding, which we call VideoStory, the correlations between the terms are utilized to learn a more effective representation by optimizing a joint objective balancing descriptiveness and predictability.We show how learning the VideoStory using a multimodal predictability loss, including appearance, motion and audio features, results in a better predictable representation. We also propose a variant of VideoStory to recognize an event in video from just the important terms in a text query by introducing a term sensitive descriptiveness loss. Our experiments on three challenging collections of web videos from the NIST TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Columbia Consumer Videos datasets demonstrate: i) the advantages of VideoStory over representations using attributes or alternative embeddings, ii) the benefit of fusing video modalities by an embedding over common strategies, iii) the complementarity of term sensitive descriptiveness and multimodal predictability for event recognition without examples. By it abilities to improve predictability upon any underlying video feature while at the same time maximizing semantic descriptiveness, VideoStory leads to state-of-the-art accuracy for both few- and zero-example recognition of events in video.

- **Summary**: The Anscombe transform offers an approximate conversion of a Poisson random variable into a Gaussian one. This transform is important and appealing, as it is easy to compute, and becomes handy in various inverse problems with Poisson noise contamination. Solution to such problems can be done by first applying the Anscombe transform, then applying a Gaussian-noise-oriented restoration algorithm of choice, and finally applying an inverse Anscombe transform. The appeal in this approach is due to the abundance of high-performance restoration algorithms designed for white additive Gaussian noise (we will refer to these hereafter as "Gaussian-solvers"). This process is known to work well for high SNR images, where the Anscombe transform provides a rather accurate approximation. When the noise level is high, the above path loses much of its effectiveness, and the common practice is to replace it with a direct treatment of the Poisson distribution. Naturally, with this we lose the ability to leverage on vastly available Gaussian-solvers.   In this work we suggest a novel method for coupling Gaussian denoising algorithms to Poisson noisy inverse problems, which is based on a general approach termed "Plug-and-Play". Deploying the Plug-and-Play approach to such problems leads to an iterative scheme that repeats several key steps: 1) A convex programming task of simple form that can be easily treated; 2) A powerful Gaussian denoising algorithm of choice; and 3) A simple update step.   Such a modular method, just like the Anscombe transform, enables other developers to plug their own Gaussian denoising algorithms to our scheme in an easy way. While the proposed method bares some similarity to the Anscombe operation, it is in fact based on a different mathematical basis, which holds true for all SNR ranges.

- **Summary**: Bearing fault diagnosis has been a challenge in the monitoring activities of rotating machinery, and it's receiving more and more attention. The conventional fault diagnosis methods usually extract features from the waveforms or spectrums of vibration signals in order to realize fault classification. In this paper, a novel feature in the form of images is presented, namely the spectrum images of vibration signals. The spectrum images are simply obtained by doing fast Fourier transformation. Such images are processed with two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) to reduce the dimensions, and then a minimum distance method is applied to classify the faults of bearings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with experimental data.

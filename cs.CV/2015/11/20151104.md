- **Summary**: We present a scalable method for brain cell identification in multiview confocal light sheet microscopy images. Our algorithmic pipeline includes a hierarchical registration approach and a novel multiview version of semantic deconvolution that simultaneously enhance visibility of fluorescent cell bodies, equalize their contrast, and fuses adjacent views into a single 3D images on which cell identification is performed with mean shift.   We present empirical results on a whole-brain image of an adult Arc-dVenus mouse acquired at 4micron resolution. Based on an annotated test volume containing 3278 cells, our algorithm achieves an $F_1$ measure of 0.89.

- **Summary**: Face aging simulation has received rising investigations nowadays, whereas it still remains a challenge to generate convincing and natural age-progressed face images. In this paper, we present a novel approach to such an issue by using hidden factor analysis joint sparse representation. In contrast to the majority of tasks in the literature that handle the facial texture integrally, the proposed aging approach separately models the person-specific facial properties that tend to be stable in a relatively long period and the age-specific clues that change gradually over time. It then merely transforms the age component to a target age group via sparse reconstruction, yielding aging effects, which is finally combined with the identity component to achieve the aged face. Experiments are carried out on three aging databases, and the results achieved clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in rendering a face with aging effects. Additionally, a series of evaluations prove its validity with respect to identity preservation and aging effect generation.

- **Summary**: Recent research on problem formulations based on decomposition into low-rank plus sparse matrices shows a suitable framework to separate moving objects from the background. The most representative problem formulation is the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) which decomposes a data matrix in a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. However, similar robust implicit or explicit decompositions can be made in the following problem formulations: Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization (RNMF), Robust Matrix Completion (RMC), Robust Subspace Recovery (RSR), Robust Subspace Tracking (RST) and Robust Low-Rank Minimization (RLRM). The main goal of these similar problem formulations is to obtain explicitly or implicitly a decomposition into low-rank matrix plus additive matrices. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of the similar problem formulations in robust subspace learning and tracking based on decomposition into low-rank plus additive matrices for testing and ranking existing algorithms for background/foreground separation. For this, we first provide a preliminary review of the recent developments in the different problem formulations which allows us to define a unified view that we called Decomposition into Low-rank plus Additive Matrices (DLAM). Then, we examine carefully each method in each robust subspace learning/tracking frameworks with their decomposition, their loss functions, their optimization problem and their solvers. Furthermore, we investigate if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for background/foreground separation. Finally, experimental results on a large-scale dataset called Background Models Challenge (BMC 2012) show the comparative performance of 32 different robust subspace learning/tracking methods.

- **Summary**: The interest in 3D dynamical tracking is growing in fields such as robotics, biology and fluid dynamics. Recently, a major source of progress in 3D tracking has been the study of collective behaviour in biological systems, where the trajectories of individual animals moving within large and dense groups need to be reconstructed to understand the behavioural interaction rules. Experimental data in this field are generally noisy and at low spatial resolution, so that individuals appear as small featureless objects and trajectories must be retrieved by making use of epipolar information only. Moreover, optical occlusions often occur: in a multi-camera system one or more objects become indistinguishable in one view, potentially jeopardizing the conservation of identity over long-time trajectories. The most advanced 3D tracking algorithms overcome optical occlusions making use of set-cover techniques, which however have to solve NP-hard optimization problems. Moreover, current methods are not able to cope with occlusions arising from actual physical proximity of objects in 3D space. Here, we present a new method designed to work directly in 3D space and time, creating (3D+1) clouds of points representing the full spatio-temporal evolution of the moving targets. We can then use a simple connected components labeling routine, which is linear in time, to solve optical occlusions, hence lowering from NP to P the complexity of the problem. Finally, we use normalized cut spectral clustering to tackle 3D physical proximity.

- **Summary**: We present a deeply integrated method of exploiting low-cost gyroscopes to improve general purpose feature tracking. Most previous methods use gyroscopes to initialize and bound the search for features. In contrast, we use them to regularize the tracking energy function so that they can directly assist in the tracking of ambiguous and poor-quality features. We demonstrate that our simple technique offers significant improvements in performance over conventional template-based tracking methods, and is in fact competitive with more complex and computationally expensive state-of-the-art trackers, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Additionally, we show that the practice of initializing template-based feature trackers like KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) using gyro-predicted optical flow offers no advantage over using a careful optical-only initialization method, suggesting that some deeper level of integration, like the method we propose, is needed in order to realize a genuine improvement in tracking performance from these inertial sensors.

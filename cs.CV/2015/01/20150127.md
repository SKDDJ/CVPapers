- **Summary**: In this paper a deterministic preprocessing algorithm is presented, whose output can be given as input to most state-of-the-art epipolar geometry estimation algorithms, improving their results considerably. They are now able to succeed on hard cases for which they failed before. The algorithm consists of three steps, whose scope changes from local to global. In the local step it extracts from a pair of images local features (e.g. SIFT). Similar features from each image are clustered and the clusters are matched yielding a large number of putative matches. In the second step pairs of spatially close features (called 2keypoints) are matched and ranked by a classifier. The 2keypoint matches with the highest ranks are selected. In the global step, from each two 2keypoint matches a fundamental matrix is computed. As quite a few of the matrices are generated from correct matches they are used to rank the putative matches found in the first step. For each match the number of fundamental matrices, for which it approximately satisfies the epipolar constraint, is calculated. This set of matches is combined with the putative matches generated by standard methods and their probabilities to be correct are estimated by a classifier. These are then given as input to state-of-the-art epipolar geometry estimation algorithms such as BEEM, BLOGS and USAC yielding much better results than the original algorithms. This was shown in extensive testing performed on almost 900 image pairs from six publicly available data-sets.

- **Summary**: The figure-ground segmentation of humans in images captured in natural environments is an outstanding open problem due to the presence of complex backgrounds, articulation, varying body proportions, partial views and viewpoint changes. In this work we propose class-specific segmentation models that leverage parametric max-flow image segmentation and a large dataset of human shapes. Our contributions are as follows: (1) formulation of a sub-modular energy model that combines class-specific structural constraints and data-driven shape priors, within a parametric max-flow optimization methodology that systematically computes all breakpoints of the model in polynomial time; (2) design of a data-driven class-specific fusion methodology, based on matching against a large training set of exemplar human shapes (100,000 in our experiments), that allows the shape prior to be constructed on-the-fly, for arbitrary viewpoints and partial views. (3) demonstration of state of the art results, in two challenging datasets, H3D and MPII (where figure-ground segmentation annotations have been added by us), where we substantially improve on the first ranked hypothesis estimates of mid-level segmentation methods, by 20%, with hypothesis set sizes that are up to one order of magnitude smaller.

- **Summary**: The reliable detection of speed of moving vehicles is considered key to traffic law enforcement in most countries, and is seen by many as an important tool to reduce the number of traffic accidents and fatalities. Many automatic systems and different methods are employed in different countries, but as a rule they tend to be expensive and/or labor intensive, often employing outdated technology due to the long development time. Here we describe a speed detection system that relies on simple everyday equipment - a laptop and a consumer web camera. Our method is based on tracking the license plates of cars, which gives the relative movement of the cars in the image. This image displacement is translated to actual motion by using the method of projection to a reference plane, where the reference plane is the road itself. However, since license plates do not touch the road, we must compensate for the entailed distortion in speed measurement. We show how to compute the compensation factor using knowledge of the license plate standard dimensions. Consequently our system computes the true speed of moving vehicles fast and accurately. We show promising results on videos obtained in a number of scenes and with different car models.

- **Summary**: Fractal image compression has some desirable properties like high quality at high compression ratio, fast decoding, and resolution independence. Therefore it can be used for many applications such as texture mapping and pattern recognition and image watermarking. But it suffers from long encoding time due to its need to find the best match between sub blocks. This time is related to the approach that is used. In this paper we present a fast encoding Algorithm based on no search method. Our goal is that more blocks are covered in initial step of quad tree algorithm. Experimental result has been compared with other new fast fractal coding methods, showing it is better in term of bit rate in same condition while the other parameters are fixed.

- **Summary**: Video processing systems such as HEVC requiring low energy consumption needed for the multimedia market has lead to extensive development in fast algorithms for the efficient approximation of 2-D DCT transforms. The DCT is employed in a multitude of compression standards due to its remarkable energy compaction properties. Multiplier-free approximate DCT transforms have been proposed that offer superior compression performance at very low circuit complexity. Such approximations can be realized in digital VLSI hardware using additions and subtractions only, leading to significant reductions in chip area and power consumption compared to conventional DCTs and integer transforms. In this paper, we introduce a novel 8-point DCT approximation that requires only 14 addition operations and no multiplications. The proposed transform possesses low computational complexity and is compared to state-of-the-art DCT approximations in terms of both algorithm complexity and peak signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed DCT approximation is a candidate for reconfigurable video standards such as HEVC. The proposed transform and several other DCT approximations are mapped to systolic-array digital architectures and physically realized as digital prototype circuits using FPGA technology and mapped to 45 nm CMOS technology.

- **Summary**: A suitable interpolation method is essential to keep the noise level minimum along with the time-delay. In recent years, many different interpolation filters have been developed for instance H.264-6 tap filter, and AVS- 4 tap filter. The present work uses Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) technique to model and investigate the effects of a four-tap low-pass tap filter (Grid-adaptive filter) on a hole-filled depth image. The work demonstrates the general form of uniform interpolations for both integer and sub-pixel locations in terms of the sampling interval and filter length of depth-images via diverse finite impulse response filtering schemes. The demonstrated model combined modelling function of fuzzy inference with the learning ability of artificial neural network.

- **Summary**: Many visual surveillance tasks, e.g.video summarisation, is conventionally accomplished through analysing imagerybased features. Relying solely on visual cues for public surveillance video understanding is unreliable, since visual observations obtained from public space CCTV video data are often not sufficiently trustworthy and events of interest can be subtle. On the other hand, non-visual data sources such as weather reports and traffic sensory signals are readily accessible but are not explored jointly to complement visual data for video content analysis and summarisation. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised framework to learn jointly from both visual and independently-drawn non-visual data sources for discovering meaningful latent structure of surveillance video data. In particular, we investigate ways to cope with discrepant dimension and representation whist associating these heterogeneous data sources, and derive effective mechanism to tolerate with missing and incomplete data from different sources. We show that the proposed multi-source learning framework not only achieves better video content clustering than state-of-the-art methods, but also is capable of accurately inferring missing non-visual semantics from previously unseen videos. In addition, a comprehensive user study is conducted to validate the quality of video summarisation generated using the proposed multi-source model.

- **Summary**: One of the biggest reasons for road accidents is curvy lanes and blind turns. Even one of the biggest hurdles for new autonomous vehicles is to detect curvy lanes, multiple lanes and lanes with a lot of discontinuity and noise. This paper presents very efficient and advanced algorithm for detecting curves having desired slopes (especially for detecting curvy lanes in real time) and detection of curves (lanes) with a lot of noise, discontinuity and disturbances. Overall aim is to develop robust method for this task which is applicable even in adverse conditions. Even in some of most famous and useful libraries like OpenCV and Matlab, there is no function available for detecting curves having desired slopes , shapes, discontinuities. Only few predefined shapes like circle, ellipse, etc, can be detected using presently available functions. Proposed algorithm can not only detect curves with discontinuity, noise, desired slope but also it can perform shadow and illumination correction and detect/ differentiate between different curves.

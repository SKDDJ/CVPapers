- **Summary**: A commonly encountered problem is the tracking of a physical object, like a maneuvering ship, aircraft, land vehicle, spacecraft or animate creature carrying a wireless device. The sensor data is often limited and inaccurate observations of range or bearing. This problem is more difficult than tracking a ballistic trajectory, because an operative affects unknown and arbitrarily changing accelerations. Although stochastic methods of filtering or state estimation (Kalman filters and particle filters) are widely used, out of vogue variational methods are more appropriate in this tracking context, because the objects do not typically display any significant random motions at the length and time scales of interest. This leads us to propose a rather elegant approach based on a \emph{shadowing filter}. The resulting filter is efficient (reduces to the solution of linear equations) and robust (uneffected by missing data and singular correlations that would cause catastrophic failure of Bayesian filters.) The tracking is so robust, that in some common situations it actually performs better by ignoring error correlations that are so vital to Kalman filters.

- **Summary**: Do object part localization methods produce bilaterally symmetric results on mirror images? Surprisingly not, even though state of the art methods augment the training set with mirrored images. In this paper we take a closer look into this issue. We first introduce the concept of mirrorability as the ability of a model to produce symmetric results in mirrored images and introduce a corresponding measure, namely the \textit{mirror error} that is defined as the difference between the detection result on an image and the mirror of the detection result on its mirror image. We evaluate the mirrorability of several state of the art algorithms in two of the most intensively studied problems, namely human pose estimation and face alignment. Our experiments lead to several interesting findings: 1) Surprisingly, most of state of the art methods struggle to preserve the mirror symmetry, despite the fact that they do have very similar overall performance on the original and mirror images; 2) the low mirrorability is not caused by training or testing sample bias - all algorithms are trained on both the original images and their mirrored versions; 3) the mirror error is strongly correlated to the localization/alignment error (with correlation coefficients around 0.7). Since the mirror error is calculated without knowledge of the ground truth, we show two interesting applications - in the first it is used to guide the selection of difficult samples and in the second to give feedback in a popular Cascaded Pose Regression method for face alignment.

- **Summary**: A graph theoretic approach is proposed for object shape representation in a hierarchical compositional architecture called Compositional Hierarchy of Parts (CHOP). In the proposed approach, vocabulary learning is performed using a hybrid generative-descriptive model. First, statistical relationships between parts are learned using a Minimum Conditional Entropy Clustering algorithm. Then, selection of descriptive parts is defined as a frequent subgraph discovery problem, and solved using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Finally, part compositions are constructed by compressing the internal data representation with discovered substructures. Shape representation and computational complexity properties of the proposed approach and algorithms are examined using six benchmark two-dimensional shape image datasets. Experiments show that CHOP can employ part shareability and indexing mechanisms for fast inference of part compositions using learned shape vocabularies. Additionally, CHOP provides better shape retrieval performance than the state-of-the-art shape retrieval methods.

- **Summary**: In supervised binary hashing, one wants to learn a function that maps a high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes, for application to fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization problem, nonconvex and nonsmooth, because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training, solving a continuous optimization, and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is quite suboptimal. Recent work has tried to optimize the objective directly over the binary codes and achieved better results, but the hash function was still learned a posteriori, which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that uses auxiliary coordinates. This closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes so that they gradually match each other. The resulting algorithm can be seen as a corrected, iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this, our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower, as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised datasets. In addition, our framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.

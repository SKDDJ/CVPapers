- **Summary**: We propose a two-stage algorithm for the super-resolution of MR images from their low-frequency k-space samples. In the first stage we estimate a resolution-independent mask whose zeros represent the edges of the image. This builds off recent work extending the theory of sampling signals of finite rate of innovation (FRI) to two-dimensional curves. We enable its application to MRI by proposing extensions of the signal models allowed by FRI theory, and by developing a more robust and efficient means to determine the edge mask. In the second stage of the scheme, we recover the super-resolved MR image using the discretized edge mask as an image prior. We evaluate our scheme on simulated single-coil MR data obtained from analytical phantoms, and compare against total variation reconstructions. Our experiments show improved performance in both noiseless and noisy settings.

- **Summary**: Image feature classification is a challenging problem in many computer vision applications, specifically, in the fields of remote sensing, image analysis and pattern recognition. In this paper, a novel Self Organizing Map, termed improved SOM (iSOM), is proposed with the aim of effectively classifying Mammographic images based on their texture feature representation. The main contribution of the iSOM is to introduce a new node structure for the map representation and adopting a learning technique based on Kohonen SOM accordingly. The main idea is to control, in an unsupervised fashion, the weight updating procedure depending on the class reliability of the node, during the weight update time. Experiments held on a real Mammographic images. Results showed high accuracy compared to classical SOM and other state-of-art classifiers.

- **Summary**: We present a novel method for communicating between a camera and display by embedding and recovering hidden and dynamic information within a displayed image. A handheld camera pointed at the display can receive not only the display image, but also the underlying message. These active scenes are fundamentally different from traditional passive scenes like QR codes because image formation is based on display emittance, not surface reflectance. Detecting and decoding the message requires careful photometric modeling for computational message recovery. Unlike standard watermarking and steganography methods that lie outside the domain of computer vision, our message recovery algorithm uses illumination to optically communicate hidden messages in real world scenes. The key innovation of our approach is an algorithm that performs simultaneous radiometric calibration and message recovery in one convex optimization problem. By modeling the photometry of the system using a camera-display transfer function (CDTF), we derive a physics-based kernel function for support vector machine classification. We demonstrate that our method of optimal online radiometric calibration (OORC) leads to an efficient and robust algorithm for computational messaging between nine commercial cameras and displays.

- **Summary**: Autonomous ground vehicles have been designed for the purpose of that relies on ranging and bearing information received from forward looking camera on the Formation control . A visual guidance control algorithm is designed where real time image processing is used to provide feedback signals. The vision subsystem and control subsystem work in parallel to accomplish formation control. A proportional navigation and line of sight guidance laws are used to estimate the range and bearing information from the leader vehicle using the vision subsystem. The algorithms for vision detection and localization used here are similar to approaches for many computer vision tasks such as face tracking and detection that are based color-and texture based features, and non-parametric Continuously Adaptive Mean-shift algorithms to keep track of the leader. This is being proposed for the first time in the leader follower framework. The algorithms are simple but effective for real time and provide an alternate approach to traditional based approaches like the Viola Jones algorithm. Further to stabilize the follower to the leader trajectory, the sliding mode controller is used to dynamically track the leader. The performance of the results is demonstrated in simulation and in practical experiments.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a patch-wise low-rank based image denoising method with constrained variational model involving local and nonlocal regularization. On one hand, recent patch-wise methods can be represented as a low-rank matrix approximation problem whose convex relaxation usually depends on nuclear norm minimization (NNM). Here, we extend the NNM to the nonconvex schatten p-norm minimization with additional weights assigned to different singular values, which is referred to as the Weighted Schatten p-Norm Minimization (WSNM). An efficient algorithm is also proposed to solve the WSNM problem. The proposed WSNM not only gives better approximation to the original low-rank assumption, but also considers physical meanings of different data components. On the other hand, due to the naive aggregation schema which integrates all the denoised patches into a whole image, current patch-wise denoising methods always produce various degree of artifacts in denoised results. Therefore, to further reduce artifacts, a data-driven regularizer called Steering Total Variation (STV) combined with nonlocal TV is derived for a variational model, which imposes local and nonlocal consistency constraints on the patch-wise denoised image. A highly simple but efficient algorithm is proposed to solve this variational model with convergence guarantee. Both WSNM and local \& nonlocal consistent regularization are integrated into an iterative restoration framework to produce final results. Extensive experimental testing shows, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed method can effectively remove noise, as well as reduce artifacts compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Auto-Monitoring and Short-Messaging-Service System is a real-time monitoring system for any critical operational environments. It detects an undesired event occurring in the environment, generates an alert with detailed message and sends it to the user to prevent hazards. This system employs a Friendly ARM as main controller while, sensors and terminals to interact with the real world. A GSM network is utilized to bridge the communication between monitoring system and user. This paper presents details of prototyping the system.

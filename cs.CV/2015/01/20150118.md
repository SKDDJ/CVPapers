- **Summary**: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using $\ell^1$-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-Rank Representation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by $\ell^2$-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR.   In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the non-convex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a graph-based learning approach to pairwise constraint propagation on multi-view data. Although pairwise constraint propagation has been studied extensively, pairwise constraints are usually defined over pairs of data points from a single view, i.e., only intra-view constraint propagation is considered for multi-view tasks. In fact, very little attention has been paid to inter-view constraint propagation, which is more challenging since pairwise constraints are now defined over pairs of data points from different views. In this paper, we propose to decompose the challenging inter-view constraint propagation problem into semi-supervised learning subproblems so that they can be efficiently solved based on graph-based label propagation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to give an efficient solution to inter-view constraint propagation from a semi-supervised learning viewpoint. Moreover, since graph-based label propagation has been adopted for basic optimization, we develop two constrained graph construction methods for interview constraint propagation, which only differ in how the intra-view pairwise constraints are exploited. The experimental results in cross-view retrieval have shown the promising performance of our inter-view constraint propagation.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new framework for visual bag-of-words (BOW) refinement and reduction to overcome the drawbacks associated with the visual BOW model which has been widely used for image classification. Although very influential in the literature, the traditional visual BOW model has two distinct drawbacks. Firstly, for efficiency purposes, the visual vocabulary is commonly constructed by directly clustering the low-level visual feature vectors extracted from local keypoints, without considering the high-level semantics of images. That is, the visual BOW model still suffers from the semantic gap, and thus may lead to significant performance degradation in more challenging tasks (e.g. social image classification). Secondly, typically thousands of visual words are generated to obtain better performance on a relatively large image dataset. Due to such large vocabulary size, the subsequent image classification may take sheer amount of time. To overcome the first drawback, we develop a graph-based method for visual BOW refinement by exploiting the tags (easy to access although noisy) of social images. More notably, for efficient image classification, we further reduce the refined visual BOW model to a much smaller size through semantic spectral clustering. Extensive experimental results show the promising performance of the proposed framework for visual BOW refinement and reduction.



### Clustering based on the In-tree Graph Structure and Affinity Propagation

- **Summary**: A recently proposed clustering method, called the Nearest Descent (ND), can organize the whole dataset into a sparsely connected graph, called the In-tree. This ND-based Intree structure proves able to reveal the clustering structure underlying the dataset, except one imperfect place, that is, there are some undesired edges in this In-tree which require to be removed. Here, we propose an effective way to automatically remove the undesired edges in In-tree via an effective combination of the In-tree structure with affinity propagation (AP). The key for the combination is to add edges between the reachable nodes in In-tree before using AP to remove the undesired edges. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Persistent surveillance from camera networks, such as at parking lots, UAVs, etc., often results in large amounts of video data, resulting in significant challenges for inference in terms of storage, communication and computation. Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on publicly available databases and show that one can obtain recognition rates that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high compression ratios.

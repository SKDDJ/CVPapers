- **Summary**: Human activity understanding with 3D/depth sensors has received increasing attention in multimedia processing and interactions. This work targets on developing a novel deep model for automatic activity recognition from RGB-D videos. We represent each human activity as an ensemble of cubic-like video segments, and learn to discover the temporal structures for a category of activities, i.e. how the activities to be decomposed in terms of classification. Our model can be regarded as a structured deep architecture, as it extends the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by incorporating structure alternatives. Specifically, we build the network consisting of 3D convolutions and max-pooling operators over the video segments, and introduce the latent variables in each convolutional layer manipulating the activation of neurons. Our model thus advances existing approaches in two aspects: (i) it acts directly on the raw inputs (grayscale-depth data) to conduct recognition instead of relying on hand-crafted features, and (ii) the model structure can be dynamically adjusted accounting for the temporal variations of human activities, i.e. the network configuration is allowed to be partially activated during inference. For model training, we propose an EM-type optimization method that iteratively (i) discovers the latent structure by determining the decomposed actions for each training example, and (ii) learns the network parameters by using the back-propagation algorithm. Our approach is validated in challenging scenarios, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. A large human activity database of RGB-D videos is presented in addition.

- **Summary**: With the rapid growth of web images, hashing has received increasing interests in large scale image retrieval. Research efforts have been devoted to learning compact binary codes that preserve semantic similarity based on labels. However, most of these hashing methods are designed to handle simple binary similarity. The complex multilevel semantic structure of images associated with multiple labels have not yet been well explored. Here we propose a deep semantic ranking based method for learning hash functions that preserve multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label images. In our approach, deep convolutional neural network is incorporated into hash functions to jointly learn feature representations and mappings from them to hash codes, which avoids the limitation of semantic representation power of hand-crafted features. Meanwhile, a ranking list that encodes the multilevel similarity information is employed to guide the learning of such deep hash functions. An effective scheme based on surrogate loss is used to solve the intractable optimization problem of nonsmooth and multivariate ranking measures involved in the learning procedure. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed approach over several state-of-the-art hashing methods in term of ranking evaluation metrics when tested on multi-label image datasets.

- **Summary**: Feature descriptors play a crucial role in a wide range of geometry analysis and processing applications, including shape correspondence, retrieval, and segmentation. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN), a generalization of the convolutional networks (CNN) paradigm to non-Euclidean manifolds. Our construction is based on a local geodesic system of polar coordinates to extract "patches", which are then passed through a cascade of filters and linear and non-linear operators. The coefficients of the filters and linear combination weights are optimization variables that are learned to minimize a task-specific cost function. We use GCNN to learn invariant shape features, allowing to achieve state-of-the-art performance in problems such as shape description, retrieval, and correspondence.

- **Summary**: Scientists in many fields have the common and basic need of dimensionality reduction: visualizing the underlying structure of the massive multivariate data in a low-dimensional space. However, many dimensionality reduction methods confront the so-called "crowding problem" that clusters tend to overlap with each other in the embedding. Previously, researchers expect to avoid that problem and seek to make clusters maximally separated in the embedding. However, the proposed in-tree (IT) based method, called IT-map, allows clusters in the embedding to be locally overlapped, while seeking to make them distinguishable by some small yet key parts. IT-map provides a simple, effective and novel solution to cluster-preserving mapping, which makes it possible to cluster the original data points interactively and thus should be of general meaning in science and engineering.

- **Summary**: The aim of this paper is to introduce procedural steps for extension of the 1D homodyne phase correction for k-space truncation in all gradient encoding directions. Compared to the existing method applied to 2D partial k-space, signal losses introduced by the phase correction filter is observed to be minimal for the extended approach. In addition, the modified form of phase correction mitigates Incidental Phase Artifacts (IPA) due to truncation. For parallel imaging with undersampling along phase encode direction, the extended homodyne filtering is shown to be effective for minimizing these artifacts when each of the channel k-spaces are truncated along both phase and frequency encode directions. This is illustrated with 2D partial k-space for flow compensated multichannel Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI). Extension of our method to 3D partial k-space shows improved reconstruction of flow information in phase contrast angiography.

- **Summary**: Progress in language and image understanding by machines has sparkled the interest of the research community in more open-ended, holistic tasks, and refueled an old AI dream of building intelligent machines. We discuss a few prominent challenges that characterize such holistic tasks and argue for "question answering about images" as a particular appealing instance of such a holistic task. In particular, we point out that it is a version of a Turing Test that is likely to be more robust to over-interpretations and contrast it with tasks like grounding and generation of descriptions. Finally, we discuss tools to measure progress in this field.

- **Summary**: Anisotropic Diffusion is widely used for noise reduction with simultaneous preservation of vascular structures in maximum intensity projected (MIP) angiograms. However, extension to minimum intensity projected (mIP) venograms in Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) poses difficulties due to spatially varying baseline. Here, we introduce a modified version of the directional anisotropic diffusion which allows us to simultaneously reduce the noise and enhance vascular structures reconstructed using both M/mIP angiograms. This method is based on spatial adaptation of the diffusion function, separately in the directions of the gradient, and along those of the minimum and maximum curvatures. The existing approach of directional anisotropic diffusion uses binary switched diffusion function to ensure diffusion along the direction of maximum curvature stopped near the vessel borders. Here, the choice of a threshold for detecting the upper limit of diffusion becomes difficult in the presence of spatially varying baseline. Also, the approach of using vesselness measure to steer the diffusion process results in structural discontinuities due to junction suppression in mIP. The merits of the proposed method include elimination of the need for an apriori choice of a threshold to detect the vessel, and problems due to junction suppression. The proposed method is also extended to multi-channel phase contrast angiogram.

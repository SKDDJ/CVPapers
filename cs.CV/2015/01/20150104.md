- **Summary**: Mining the underlying patterns in gigantic and complex data is of great importance to data analysts. In this paper, we propose a motion pattern approach to mine frequent behaviors in trajectory data. Motion patterns, defined by a set of highly similar flow vector groups in a spatial locality, have been shown to be very effective in extracting dominant motion behaviors in video sequences. Inspired by applications and properties of motion patterns, we have designed a framework that successfully solves the general task of trajectory clustering. Our proposed algorithm consists of four phases: flow vector computation, motion component extraction, motion component's reachability set creation, and motion pattern formation. For the first phase, we break down trajectories into flow vectors that indicate instantaneous movements. In the second phase, via a Kmeans clustering approach, we create motion components by clustering the flow vectors with respect to their location and velocity. Next, we create motion components' reachability set in terms of spatial proximity and motion similarity. Finally, for the fourth phase, we cluster motion components using agglomerative clustering with the weighted Jaccard distance between the motion components' signatures, a set created using path reachability. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method in an extensive set of experiments on diverse datasets. Further, we have shown how our proposed method handles difficulties in the general task of trajectory clustering that challenge the existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We describe a convex programming framework for pose estimation in 2D/3D point-set registration with unknown point correspondences. We give two mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINP) formulations of the 2D/3D registration problem when there are multiple 2D images, and propose convex relaxations for both of the MINPs to semidefinite programs (SDP) that can be solved efficiently by interior point methods. Our approach to the 2D/3D registration problem is non-iterative in nature as we jointly solve for pose and correspondence. Furthermore, these convex programs can readily incorporate feature descriptors of points to enhance registration results. We prove that the convex programs exactly recover the solution to the original nonconvex 2D/3D registration problem under noiseless condition. We apply these formulations to the registration of 3D models of coronary vessels to their 2D projections obtained from multiple intra-operative fluoroscopic images. For this application, we experimentally corroborate the exact recovery property in the absence of noise and further demonstrate robustness of the convex programs in the presence of noise.

- **Summary**: We propose a fast, accurate matching method for estimating dense pixel correspondences across scenes. It is a challenging problem to estimate dense pixel correspondences between images depicting different scenes or instances of the same object category. While most such matching methods rely on hand-crafted features such as SIFT, we learn features from a large amount of unlabeled image patches using unsupervised learning. Pixel-layer features are obtained by encoding over the dictionary, followed by spatial pooling to obtain patch-layer features. The learned features are then seamlessly embedded into a multi-layer match- ing framework. We experimentally demonstrate that the learned features, together with our matching model, outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the SIFT flow, coherency sensitive hashing and the recent deformable spatial pyramid matching methods both in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of a few different dictionary learning and feature encoding methods in the proposed pixel correspondences estimation framework, and analyse the impact of dictionary learning and feature encoding with respect to the final matching performance.

- **Summary**: A brief review is provided of the use of the Square Wave Method (SWM) in the field of signal and image analysis and it is specified how results thus obtained are expressed using the Square Wave Transform (SWT), in the frequency domain. To illustrate the new approach introduced in this field, the results of two cases are analyzed: a) a sequence of samples (that is, measured values) of an electromyographic recording; and b) the classic image of Lenna.

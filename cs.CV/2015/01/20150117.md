- **Summary**: In this paper a new fractal image compression algorithm is proposed in which the time of encoding process is considerably reduced. The algorithm exploits a domain pool reduction approach, along with using innovative predefined values for contrast scaling factor, S, instead of scanning the parameter space [0,1]. Within this approach only domain blocks with entropies greater than a threshold are considered. As a novel point, it is assumed that in each step of the encoding process, the domain block with small enough distance shall be found only for the range blocks with low activity (equivalently low entropy). This novel point is used to find reasonable estimations of S, and use them in the encoding process as predefined values, mentioned above. The algorithm has been examined for some well-known images. This result shows that our proposed algorithm considerably reduces the encoding time producing images that are approximately the same in quality.

- **Summary**: After the incredible success of deep learning in the computer vision domain, there has been much interest in applying Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features in robotic fields such as visual navigation and SLAM. Unfortunately, there are fundamental differences and challenges involved. Computer vision datasets are very different in character to robotic camera data, real-time performance is essential, and performance priorities can be different. This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the utility of three state-of-the-art ConvNets on the problems of particular relevance to navigation for robots; viewpoint-invariance and condition-invariance, and for the first time enables real-time place recognition performance using ConvNets with large maps by integrating a variety of existing (locality-sensitive hashing) and novel (semantic search space partitioning) optimization techniques. We present extensive experiments on four real world datasets cultivated to evaluate each of the specific challenges in place recognition. The results demonstrate that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling real-time performance. We confirm that networks trained for semantic place categorization also perform better at (specific) place recognition when faced with severe appearance changes and provide a reference for which networks and layers are optimal for different aspects of the place recognition problem.

- **Summary**: The segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a longstanding yet challenging task, not only because of the presence of speckle, but also due to the variations of surface backscattering properties in the images. Tremendous investigations have been made to eliminate the speckle effects for the segmentation of SAR images, while few work devotes to dealing with the variations of backscattering coefficients in the images. In order to overcome both the two difficulties, this paper presents a novel SAR image segmentation method by exploiting a multi-scale active contour model based on the non-local processing principle. More precisely, we first formulize the SAR segmentation problem with an active contour model by integrating the non-local interactions between pairs of patches inside and outside the segmented regions. Secondly, a multi-scale strategy is proposed to speed up the non-local active contour segmentation procedure and to avoid falling into local minimum for achieving more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on simulated and real SAR images demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method: it can not only achieve precise segmentations for images with heavy speckles and non-local intensity variations, but also can be used for SAR images from different types of sensors.

- **Summary**: Melanoma spreads through metastasis, and therefore it has been proven to be very fatal. Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the infection; early detection and intervention of melanoma implicates higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma is challenging since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors subjectivity. This paper proposes an innovative and fully functional smart-phone based application to assist in melanoma early detection and prevention. The application has two major components; the first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skin burn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced. The second component is an automated image analysis module which contains image acquisition, hair detection and exclusion, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed system exploits PH2 Dermoscopy image database from Pedro Hispano Hospital for development and testing purposes. The image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopy images of lesions, including normal, atypical, and melanoma cases. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient, achieving classification of the normal, atypical and melanoma images with accuracy of 96.3%, 95.7% and 97.5%, respectively.

- **Summary**: The first and second mode stress intensity factors (SIFs) of a contact problem between a half-plane with an edge crack and an asymmetric tilted wedge were obtained using experimental method of Digital Image Correlation (DIC). In this technique, displacement and strain fields can be measured using two digital images of the same sample at different stages of loading. However, several images were taken consequently in each stage of this experiment to avoid the noise effect. A pair of images of each stage was compared to each other. Then, the correlation coefficients between them were studied using a computer code. The pairs with the correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 were selected as the acceptable match for displacement measurements near the crack tip. Subsequently, the SIFs of specimens were calculated using displacement fields obtained from DIC method. The effect of wedge tips angle on their SIFs was also studied. Moreover, the results of DIC method were compared with the results of photoelasticity method and a close agreement between them was observed.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel method to recognize stem - calyx of an apple using shape descriptors. The main drawback of existing apple grading techniques is that stem - calyx part of an apple is treated as defects, this leads to poor grading of apples. In order to overcome this drawback, we proposed an approach to recognize stem-calyx and differentiated from true defects based on shape features. Our method comprises of steps such as segmentation of apple using grow-cut method, candidate objects such as stem-calyx and small defects are detected using multi-threshold segmentation. The shape features are extracted from detected objects using Multifractal, Fourier and Radon descriptor and finally stem-calyx regions are recognized and differentiated from true defects using SVM classifier. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments conducted on apple image dataset and results exhibit considerable improvement in recognition of stem-calyx region compared to other techniques.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel method to grade the date fruits based on the combination of shape and texture features. The method begins with reducing the specular reflection and small noise using a bilateral filter. Threshold based segmentation is performed for background removal and fruit part selection from the given image. Shape features is extracted using the contour of the date fruit and texture features are extracted using Curvelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) from the selected date fruit region. Finally, combinations of shape and texture features are fused to grade the dates into six grades. k-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN) classifier yields the best grading rate compared to other two classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant(LDA) classifiers. The experiment result shows that our technique achieves highest accuracy.

- **Summary**: In this paper, the problem of de-noising of an image contaminated with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is studied. This subject is an open problem in signal processing for more than 50 years. Local methods suggested in recent years, have obtained better results than global methods. However by more intelligent training in such a way that first, important data is more effective for training, second, clustering in such way that training blocks lie in low-rank subspaces, we can design a dictionary applicable for image de-noising and obtain results near the state of the art local methods. In the present paper, we suggest a method based on global clustering of image constructing blocks. As the type of clustering plays an important role in clustering-based de-noising methods, we address two questions about the clustering. The first, which parts of the data should be considered for clustering? and the second, what data clustering method is suitable for de-noising.? Then clustering is exploited to learn an over complete dictionary. By obtaining sparse decomposition of the noisy image blocks in terms of the dictionary atoms, the de-noised version is achieved. In addition to our framework, 7 popular dictionary learning methods are simulated and compared. The results are compared based on two major factors: (1) de-noising performance and (2) execution time. Experimental results show that our dictionary learning framework outperforms its competitors in terms of both factors.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for annotating the location of objects in ImageNet. Traditionally, this is cast as an image window classification problem, where each window is considered independently and scored based on its appearance alone. Instead, we propose a method which scores each candidate window in the context of all other windows in the image, taking into account their similarity in appearance space as well as their spatial relations in the image plane. We devise a fast and exact procedure to optimize our scoring function over all candidate windows in an image, and we learn its parameters using structured output regression. We demonstrate on 92000 images from ImageNet that this significantly improves localization over recent techniques that score windows in isolation.

- **Summary**: Object detection is one of the most important challenges in computer vision. Object detectors are usually trained on bounding-boxes from still images. Recently, video has been used as an alternative source of data. Yet, for a given test domain (image or video), the performance of the detector depends on the domain it was trained on. In this paper, we examine the reasons behind this performance gap. We define and evaluate different domain shift factors: spatial location accuracy, appearance diversity, image quality and aspect distribution. We examine the impact of these factors by comparing performance before and after factoring them out. The results show that all four factors affect the performance of the detectors and their combined effect explains nearly the whole performance gap.

- **Summary**: Imaging and Image sensors is a field that is continuously evolving. There are new products coming into the market every day. Some of these have very severe Size, Weight and Power constraints whereas other devices have to handle very high computational loads. Some require both these conditions to be met simultaneously. Current imaging architectures and digital image processing solutions will not be able to meet these ever increasing demands. There is a need to develop novel imaging architectures and image processing solutions to address these requirements. In this work we propose analog signal processing as a solution to this problem. The analog processor is not suggested as a replacement to a digital processor but it will be used as an augmentation device which works in parallel with the digital processor, making the system faster and more efficient. In order to show the merits of analog processing two stereo correspondence algorithms are implemented. We propose novel modifications to the algorithms and new imaging architectures which, significantly reduces the computation time.

- **Summary**: Multi-view Geometry is reviewed from an Algebraic Geometry perspective and multi-focal tensors are constructed as equivariant projections of the Grassmannian. A connection to the principal minor assignment problem is made by considering several flatlander cameras. The ideal of the quadrifocal variety is computed up to degree 8 (and partially in degree 9) using the representations of $\operatorname{GL}(3)^{\times 4}$ in the polynomial ring on the space of $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$ tensors. Further representation-theoretic analysis gives a lower bound for the number of minimal generators.

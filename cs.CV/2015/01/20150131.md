- **Summary**: Most object detection methods operate by applying a binary classifier to sub-windows of an image, followed by a non-maximum suppression step where detections on overlapping sub-windows are removed. Since the number of possible sub-windows in even moderately sized image datasets is extremely large, the classifier is typically learned from only a subset of the windows. This avoids the computational difficulty of dealing with the entire set of sub-windows, however, as we will show in this paper, it leads to sub-optimal detector performance.   In particular, the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new method, Max-Margin Object Detection (MMOD), for learning to detect objects in images. This method does not perform any sub-sampling, but instead optimizes over all sub-windows. MMOD can be used to improve any object detection method which is linear in the learned parameters, such as HOG or bag-of-visual-word models. Using this approach we show substantial performance gains on three publicly available datasets. Strikingly, we show that a single rigid HOG filter can outperform a state-of-the-art deformable part model on the Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark when the HOG filter is learned via MMOD.

- **Summary**: Freehand line sketches are an interesting and unique form of visual representation. Typically, such sketches are studied and utilized as an end product of the sketching process. However, we have found it instructive to study the sketches as sequentially accumulated composition of drawing strokes added over time. Studying sketches in this manner has enabled us to create novel sparse yet discriminative sketch-based representations for object categories which we term category-epitomes. Our procedure for obtaining these epitomes concurrently provides a natural measure for quantifying the sparseness underlying the original sketch, which we term epitome-score. We construct and analyze category-epitomes and epitome-scores for freehand sketches belonging to various object categories. Our analysis provides a novel viewpoint for studying the semantic nature of object categories.

- **Summary**: Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been commonly used as a principled way to understand the high-dimensional data such as facial images. In this paper, we propose a new supervised DR method called Optimized Projection for Sparse Representation based Classification (OP-SRC), which is based on the recent face recognition method, Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC). SRC seeks a sparse linear combination on all the training data for a given query image, and make the decision by the minimal reconstruction residual. OP-SRC is designed on the decision rule of SRC, it aims to reduce the within-class reconstruction residual and simultaneously increase the between-class reconstruction residual on the training data. The projections are optimized and match well with the mechanism of SRC. Therefore, SRC performs well in the OP-SRC transformed space. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the Yale, ORL and UMIST databases with promising results.

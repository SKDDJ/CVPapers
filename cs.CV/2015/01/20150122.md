- **Summary**: Mixture of parts model has been successfully applied to 2D human pose estimation problem either as explicitly trained body part model or as latent variables for the whole human body model. Mixture of parts model usually utilize tree structure for representing relations between body parts. Tree structures facilitate training and referencing of the model but could not deal with double counting problems, which hinder its applications in 3D pose estimation. While most of work targeted to solve these problems tend to modify the tree models or the optimization target. We incorporate other cues from input features. For example, in surveillance environments, human silhouettes can be extracted relative easily although not flawlessly. In this condition, we can combine extracted human blobs with histogram of gradient feature, which is commonly used in mixture of parts model for training body part templates. The method can be easily extend to other candidate features under our generalized framework. We show 2D body part detection results on a public available dataset: HumanEva dataset. Furthermore, a 2D to 3D pose estimator is trained with Gaussian process regression model and 2D body part detections from the proposed method is fed to the estimator, thus 3D poses are predictable given new 2D body part detections. We also show results of 3D pose estimation on HumanEva dataset.

- **Summary**: Motion trajectory recognition is important for characterizing the moving property of an object. The speed and accuracy of trajectory recognition rely on a compact and discriminative feature representation, and the situations of varying rotation, scaling and translation has to be specially considered. In this paper we propose a novel feature extraction method for trajectories. Firstly a trajectory is represented by a proposed point context, which is a rotation-scale-translation (RST) invariant shape descriptor with a flexible tradeoff between computational complexity and discrimination, yet we prove that it is a complete shape descriptor. Secondly, the shape context is nonlinearly mapped to a subspace by kernel nonparametric discriminant analysis (KNDA) to get a compact feature representation, and thus a trajectory is projected to a single point in a low-dimensional feature space. Experimental results show that, the proposed trajectory feature shows encouraging improvement than state-of-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, convex hull based features are used for recognition of isolated Roman numerals using a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier. Experiments of convex hull based features for handwritten character recognition are few in numbers. Convex hull of a pattern and the centroid of the convex hull both are affine invariant attributes. In this work, 25 features are extracted based on different bays attributes of the convex hull of the digit patterns. Then these patterns are divided into four sub-images with respect to the centroid of the convex hull boundary. From each such sub-image 25 bays features are also calculated. In all 125 convex hull based features are extracted for each numeric digit patterns under the current experiment. The performance of the designed feature set is tested on the standard MNIST data set, consisting of 60000 training and 10000 test images of handwritten Roman using an MLP based classifier a maximum success rate of 97.44% is achieved on the test data.

- **Summary**: Soft computing approaches are mainly designed to address the real world ill-defined, imprecisely formulated problems, combining different kind of novel models of computation, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms (GAs. Handwritten digit recognition is a typical example of one such problem. In the current work we have developed a two-pass approach where the first pass classifier performs a coarse classification, based on some global features of the input pattern by restricting the possibility of classification decisions within a group of classes, smaller than the number of classes considered initially. In the second pass, the group specific classifiers concentrate on the features extracted from the selected local regions, and refine the earlier decision by combining the local and the global features for selecting the true class of the input pattern from the group of candidate classes selected in the first pass. To optimize the selection of local regions a GA based approach has been developed here. The maximum recognition performance on Bangla digit samples as achieved on the test set, during the first pass of the two pass approach is 93.35%. After combining the results of the two stage classifiers, an overall success rate of 95.25% is achieved.

- **Summary**: Appropriate feature set for representation of pattern classes is one of the most important aspects of handwritten character recognition. The effectiveness of features depends on the discriminating power of the features chosen to represent patterns of different classes. However, discriminatory features are not easily measurable. Investigative experimentation is necessary for identifying discriminatory features. In the present work we have identified a new variation of feature set which significantly outperforms on handwritten Bangla alphabet from the previously used feature set. 132 number of features in all viz. modified shadow features, octant and centroid features, distance based features, quad tree based longest run features are used here. Using this feature set the recognition performance increases sharply from the 75.05% observed in our previous work [7], to 85.40% on 50 character classes with MLP based classifier on the same dataset.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach to automatically tracking cell populations in time-lapse images. To account for cell occlusions and overlaps, we introduce a robust method that generates an over-complete set of competing detection hypotheses. We then perform detection and tracking simultaneously on these hypotheses by solving to optimality an integer program with only one type of flow variables. This eliminates the need for heuristics to handle missed detections due to occlusions and complex morphology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a range of challenging sequences consisting of clumped cells and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: Linear mixture models are commonly used to represent hyperspectral datacube as a linear combinations of endmember spectra. However, determining of the number of endmembers for images embedded in noise is a crucial task. This paper proposes a fully automatic approach for estimating the number of endmembers in hyperspectral images. The estimation is based on recent results of random matrix theory related to the so-called spiked population model. More precisely, we study the gap between successive eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix constructed from high dimensional noisy samples. The resulting estimation strategy is unsupervised and robust to correlated noise. This strategy is validated on both synthetic and real images. The experimental results are very promising and show the accuracy of this algorithm with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Today Bayesian networks are more used in many areas of decision support and image processing. In this way, our proposed approach uses Bayesian Network to modelize the segmented image quality. This quality is calculated on a set of attributes that represent local evaluation measures. The idea is to have these local levels chosen in a way to be intersected into them to keep the overall appearance of segmentation. The approach operates in two phases: the first phase is to make an over-segmentation which gives superpixels card. In the second phase, we model the superpixels by a Bayesian Network. To find the segmented image with the best overall quality we used two approximate inference methods, the first using ICM algorithm which is widely used in Markov Models and a second is a recursive method called algorithm of model decomposition based on max-product algorithm which is very popular in the recent works of image segmentation. For our model, we have shown that the composition of these two algorithms leads to good segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Segmentation is a fundamental task for extracting semantically meaningful regions from an image. The goal of segmentation algorithms is to accurately assign object labels to each image location. However, image-noise, shortcomings of algorithms, and image ambiguities cause uncertainty in label assignment. Estimating the uncertainty in label assignment is important in multiple application domains, such as segmenting tumors from medical images for radiation treatment planning. One way to estimate these uncertainties is through the computation of posteriors of Bayesian models, which is computationally prohibitive for many practical applications. On the other hand, most computationally efficient methods fail to estimate label uncertainty. We therefore propose in this paper the Active Mean Fields (AMF) approach, a technique based on Bayesian modeling that uses a mean-field approximation to efficiently compute a segmentation and its corresponding uncertainty. Based on a variational formulation, the resulting convex model combines any label-likelihood measure with a prior on the length of the segmentation boundary. A specific implementation of that model is the Chan-Vese segmentation model (CV), in which the binary segmentation task is defined by a Gaussian likelihood and a prior regularizing the length of the segmentation boundary. Furthermore, the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the AMF model are equivalent to those of the popular Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model for image denoising. Solutions to the AMF model can thus be implemented by directly utilizing highly-efficient ROF solvers on log-likelihood ratio fields. We qualitatively assess the approach on synthetic data as well as on real natural and medical images. For a quantitative evaluation, we apply our approach to the icgbench dataset.

- **Summary**: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful class of feature extraction techniques that has been successfully applied in many fields, namely in signal and image processing. Current NMF techniques have been limited to a single-objective problem in either its linear or nonlinear kernel-based formulation. In this paper, we propose to revisit the NMF as a multi-objective problem, in particular a bi-objective one, where the objective functions defined in both input and feature spaces are taken into account. By taking the advantage of the sum-weighted method from the literature of multi-objective optimization, the proposed bi-objective NMF determines a set of nondominated, Pareto optimal, solutions instead of a single optimal decomposition. Moreover, the corresponding Pareto front is studied and approximated. Experimental results on unmixing real hyperspectral images confirm the efficiency of the proposed bi-objective NMF compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

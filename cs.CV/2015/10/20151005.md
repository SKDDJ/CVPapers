- **Summary**: Image contrast enhancement for outdoor vision is important for smart car auxiliary transport systems. The video frames captured in poor weather conditions are often characterized by poor visibility. Most image dehazing algorithms consider to use a hard threshold assumptions or user input to estimate atmospheric light. However, the brightest pixels sometimes are objects such as car lights or streetlights, especially for smart car auxiliary transport systems. Simply using a hard threshold may cause a wrong estimation. In this paper, we propose a single optimized image dehazing method that estimates atmospheric light efficiently and removes haze through the estimation of a semi-globally adaptive filter. The enhanced images are characterized with little noise and good exposure in dark regions. The textures and edges of the processed images are also enhanced significantly.

- **Summary**: Multiple-instance learning (MIL) has served as an important tool for a wide range of vision applications, for instance, image classification, object detection, and visual tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve the classical MIL problem, named relaxed multiple-instance SVM (RMI-SVM). We treat the positiveness of instance as a continuous variable, use Noisy-OR model to enforce the MIL constraints, and jointly optimize the bag label and instance label in a unified framework. The optimization problem can be efficiently solved using stochastic gradient decent. The extensive experiments demonstrate that RMI-SVM consistently achieves superior performance on various benchmarks for MIL. Moreover, we simply applied RMI-SVM to a challenging vision task, common object discovery. The state-of-the-art results of object discovery on Pascal VOC datasets further confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The 2D Least Median of Squares (LMS) is a popular tool in robust regression because of its high breakdown point: up to half of the input data can be contaminated with outliers without affecting the accuracy of the LMS estimator. The complexity of 2D LMS estimation has been shown to be $\Omega(n^2)$ where $n$ is the total number of points. This high theoretical complexity along with the availability of graphics processing units (GPU) motivates the development of a fast, parallel, GPU-based algorithm for LMS computation. We present a CUDA based algorithm for LMS computation and show it to be much faster than the optimal state of the art single threaded CPU algorithm. We begin by describing the proposed method and analyzing its performance. We then demonstrate how it can be used to modify the well-known Hough Transform (HT) in order to efficiently detect image lines in noisy images. Our method is compared with standard HT-based line detection methods and shown to overcome their shortcomings in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

- **Summary**: In this paper, the problem of compressive imaging is addressed using natural randomization by means of a multiply scattering medium. To utilize the medium in this way, its corresponding transmission matrix must be estimated. To calibrate the imager, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD) as a simple, cheap, and high-resolution binary intensity modulator. We propose a phase retrieval algorithm which is well adapted to intensity-only measurements on the camera, and to the input binary intensity patterns, both to estimate the complex transmission matrix as well as image reconstruction. We demonstrate promising experimental results for the proposed algorithm using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits as example images.

- **Summary**: As humans, we regularly interpret images based on the relations between image regions. For example, a person riding object X, or a plank bridging two objects. Current methods provide limited support to search for images based on such relations. We present RAID, a relation-augmented image descriptor that supports queries based on inter-region relations. The key idea of our descriptor is to capture the spatial distribution of simple point-to-region relationships to describe more complex relationships between two image regions. We evaluate the proposed descriptor by querying into a large subset of the Microsoft COCO database and successfully extract nontrivial images demonstrating complex inter-region relations, which are easily missed or erroneously classified by existing methods.

- **Summary**: Bregman iterations are known to yield excellent results for denoising, deblurring and compressed sensing tasks, but so far this technique has rarely been used for other image processing problems. In this paper we give a thorough description of the Bregman iteration, unifying thereby results of different authors within a common framework. Then we show how to adapt the split Bregman iteration, originally developed by Goldstein and Osher for image restoration purposes, to optical flow which is a fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision. We consider some classic and modern optical flow models and present detailed algorithms that exhibit the benefits of the Bregman iteration. By making use of the results of the Bregman framework, we address the issues of convergence and error estimation for the algorithms. Numerical examples complement the theoretical part.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel object tracking method based on approximated Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC). Rather than using a non-negativity constraint on encoding coefficients to guarantee these elements nonnegative, in this paper, the non-negativity constraint is substituted for a conventional $\ell_2$ norm regularization term in approximated LLC to obtain the similar nonnegative effect. And we provide a detailed and adequate explanation in theoretical analysis to clarify the rationality of this replacement. Instead of specifying fixed K nearest neighbors to construct the local dictionary, a series of different dictionaries with pre-defined numbers of nearest neighbors are selected. Weights of these various dictionaries are also learned from approximated LLC in the similar framework. In order to alleviate tracking drifts, we propose a simple and efficient occlusion detection method. The occlusion detection criterion mainly depends on whether negative templates are selected to represent the severe occluded target. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on several challenging sequences show that the proposed tracking algorithm achieves favorable performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Efficient generation of high-quality object proposals is an essential step in state-of-the-art object detection systems based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) features. Current object proposal algorithms are computationally inefficient in processing high resolution images containing small objects, which makes them the bottleneck in object detection systems. In this paper we present effective methods to detect objects for high resolution images. We combine two complementary strategies. The first approach is to predict bounding boxes based on adjacent visual features. The second approach uses high level image features to guide a two-step search process that adaptively focuses on regions that are likely to contain small objects. We extract features required for the two strategies by utilizing a pre-trained DCNN model known as AlexNet. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by showing its performance on a high-resolution image subset of the SUN 2012 object detection dataset.

- **Summary**: Purpose: In this paper, we investigate a framework for interactive brain tumor segmentation which, at its core, treats the problem of interactive brain tumor segmentation as a machine learning problem.   Methods: This method has an advantage over typical machine learning methods for this task where generalization is made across brains. The problem with these methods is that they need to deal with intensity bias correction and other MRI-specific noise. In this paper, we avoid these issues by approaching the problem as one of within brain generalization. Specifically, we propose a semi-automatic method that segments a brain tumor by training and generalizing within that brain only, based on some minimum user interaction.   Conclusion: We investigate how adding spatial feature coordinates (i.e. $i$, $j$, $k$) to the intensity features can significantly improve the performance of different classification methods such as SVM, kNN and random forests. This would only be possible within an interactive framework. We also investigate the use of a more appropriate kernel and the adaptation of hyper-parameters specifically for each brain.   Results: As a result of these experiments, we obtain an interactive method whose results reported on the MICCAI-BRATS 2013 dataset are the second most accurate compared to published methods, while using significantly less memory and processing power than most state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In this dissertation, we present a generative model to capture the relation between facial image quality features (like pose, illumination direction, etc) and face recognition performance. Such a model can be used to predict the performance of a face recognition system. Since the model is based solely on image quality features, performance predictions can be done even before the actual recognition has taken place thereby facilitating many preemptive action. A practical limitation of such a data driven generative model is the limited nature of training data set. To address this limitation, we have developed a Bayesian approach to model the distribution of recognition performance measure based on the number of match and non-match scores in small regions of the image quality space. Random samples drawn from these models provide the initial data essential for training the generative model. Experiment results based on six face recognition systems operating on three independent data sets show that the proposed performance prediction model can accurately predict face recognition performance using an accurate and unbiased Image Quality Assessor (IQA). Furthermore, our results show that variability in the unaccounted quality space -- the image quality features not considered by the IQA -- is the major factor causing inaccuracies in predicted performance.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a data driven model to predict the performance of a face recognition system based on image quality features. We model the relationship between image quality features (e.g. pose, illumination, etc.) and recognition performance measures using a probability density function. To address the issue of limited nature of practical training data inherent in most data driven models, we have developed a Bayesian approach to model the distribution of recognition performance measures in small regions of the quality space. Since the model is based solely on image quality features, it can predict performance even before the actual recognition has taken place. We evaluate the performance predictive capabilities of the proposed model for six face recognition systems (two commercial and four open source) operating on three independent data sets: MultiPIE, FRGC and CAS-PEAL. Our results show that the proposed model can accurately predict performance using an accurate and unbiased Image Quality Assessor (IQA). Furthermore, our experiments highlight the impact of the unaccounted quality space -- the image quality features not considered by IQA -- in contributing to performance prediction errors.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a nonparametric scene parsing approach that improves the overall accuracy, as well as the coverage of foreground classes in scene images. We first improve the label likelihood estimates at superpixels by merging likelihood scores from different probabilistic classifiers. This boosts the classification performance and enriches the representation of less-represented classes. Our second contribution consists of incorporating semantic context in the parsing process through global label costs. Our method does not rely on image retrieval sets but rather assigns a global likelihood estimate to each label, which is plugged into the overall energy function. We evaluate our system on two large-scale datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SIFTflow dataset and near-record results on LMSun.

- **Summary**: This chapter reviews recent computational models of visual attention. We begin with models for the bottom-up or stimulus-driven guidance of attention to salient visual items, which we examine in seven different broad categories. We then examine more complex models which address the top-down or goal-oriented guidance of attention towards items that are more relevant to the task at hand.

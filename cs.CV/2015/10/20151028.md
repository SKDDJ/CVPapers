- **Summary**: In this work, we consider the problem of pedestrian detection in natural scenes. Intuitively, instances of pedestrians with different spatial scales may exhibit dramatically different features. Thus, large variance in instance scales, which results in undesirable large intra-category variance in features, may severely hurt the performance of modern object instance detection methods. We argue that this issue can be substantially alleviated by the divide-and-conquer philosophy. Taking pedestrian detection as an example, we illustrate how we can leverage this philosophy to develop a Scale-Aware Fast R-CNN (SAF R-CNN) framework. The model introduces multiple built-in sub-networks which detect pedestrians with scales from disjoint ranges. Outputs from all the sub-networks are then adaptively combined to generate the final detection results that are shown to be robust to large variance in instance scales, via a gate function defined over the sizes of object proposals. Extensive evaluations on several challenging pedestrian detection datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAF R-CNN. Particularly, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Caltech, INRIA, and ETH, and obtains competitive results on KITTI.

- **Summary**: Segmentation of biomedical images is essential for studying and characterizing anatomical structures, detection and evaluation of pathological tissues. Segmentation has been further shown to enhance the reconstruction performance in many tomographic imaging modalities by accounting for heterogeneities of the excitation field and tissue properties in the imaged region. This is particularly relevant in optoacoustic tomography, where discontinuities in the optical and acoustic tissue properties, if not properly accounted for, may result in deterioration of the imaging performance. Efficient segmentation of optoacoustic images is often hampered by the relatively low intrinsic contrast of large anatomical structures, which is further impaired by the limited angular coverage of some commonly employed tomographic imaging configurations. Herein, we analyze the performance of active contour models for boundary segmentation in cross-sectional optoacoustic tomography. The segmented mask is employed to construct a two compartment model for the acoustic and optical parameters of the imaged tissues, which is subsequently used to improve accuracy of the image reconstruction routines. The performance of the suggested segmentation and modeling approach are showcased in tissue-mimicking phantoms and small animal imaging experiments.

- **Summary**: We introduce and show preliminary results of a fast randomized method that finds a set of K paths lying in distinct homotopy classes. We frame the path planning task as a graph search problem, where the navigation graph is based on a Voronoi diagram. The search is biased by a cost function derived from the social force model that is used to generate and select the paths. We compare our method to Yen's algorithm, and empirically show that our approach is faster to find a subset of homotopy classes. Furthermore our approach computes a set of more diverse paths with respect to the baseline while obtaining a negligible loss in path quality.

- **Summary**: Representing 3D shape deformations by linear models in high-dimensional space has many applications in computer vision and medical imaging, such as shape-based interpolation or segmentation. Commonly, using Principal Components Analysis a low-dimensional (affine) subspace of the high-dimensional shape space is determined. However, the resulting factors (the most dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) have global support, i.e. changing the coefficient of a single factor deforms the entire shape. In this paper, a method to obtain deformation factors with local support is presented. The benefits of such models include better flexibility and interpretability as well as the possibility of interactively deforming shapes locally. For that, based on a well-grounded theoretical motivation, we formulate a matrix factorisation problem employing sparsity and graph-based regularisation terms. We demonstrate that for brain shapes our method outperforms the state of the art in local support models with respect to generalisation ability and sparse shape reconstruction, whereas for human body shapes our method gives more realistic deformations.

- **Summary**: In this work, we propose using camera arrays coupled with coherent illumination as an effective method of improving spatial resolution in long distance images by a factor of ten and beyond. Recent advances in ptychography have demonstrated that one can image beyond the diffraction limit of the objective lens in a microscope. We demonstrate a similar imaging system to image beyond the diffraction limit in long range imaging. We emulate a camera array with a single camera attached to an X-Y translation stage. We show that an appropriate phase retrieval based reconstruction algorithm can be used to effectively recover the lost high resolution details from the multiple low resolution acquired images. We analyze the effects of noise, required degree of image overlap, and the effect of increasing synthetic aperture size on the reconstructed image quality. We show that coherent camera arrays have the potential to greatly improve imaging performance. Our simulations show resolution gains of 10x and more are achievable. Furthermore, experimental results from our proof-of-concept systems show resolution gains of 4x-7x for real scenes. Finally, we introduce and analyze in simulation a new strategy to capture macroscopic Fourier Ptychography images in a single snapshot, albeit using a camera array.

- **Summary**: Sparse subspace clustering methods, such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) \cite{ElhamifarV13} and $\ell^{1}$-graph \cite{YanW09,ChengYYFH10}, are effective in partitioning the data that lie in a union of subspaces. Most of those methods use $\ell^{1}$-norm or $\ell^{2}$-norm with thresholding to impose the sparsity of the constructed sparse similarity graph, and certain assumptions, e.g. independence or disjointness, on the subspaces are required to obtain the subspace-sparse representation, which is the key to their success. Such assumptions are not guaranteed to hold in practice and they limit the application of sparse subspace clustering on subspaces with general location. In this paper, we propose a new sparse subspace clustering method named $\ell^{0}$-graph. In contrast to the required assumptions on subspaces for most existing sparse subspace clustering methods, it is proved that subspace-sparse representation can be obtained by $\ell^{0}$-graph for arbitrary distinct underlying subspaces almost surely under the mild i.i.d. assumption on the data generation. We develop a proximal method to obtain the sub-optimal solution to the optimization problem of $\ell^{0}$-graph with proved guarantee of convergence. Moreover, we propose a regularized $\ell^{0}$-graph that encourages nearby data to have similar neighbors so that the similarity graph is more aligned within each cluster and the graph connectivity issue is alleviated. Extensive experimental results on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of $\ell^{0}$-graph compared to other competing clustering methods, as well as the effectiveness of regularized $\ell^{0}$-graph.

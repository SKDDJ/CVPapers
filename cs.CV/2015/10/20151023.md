- **Summary**: The nuclear norm is widely used as a convex surrogate of the rank function in compressive sensing for low rank matrix recovery with its applications in image recovery and signal processing. However, solving the nuclear norm based relaxed convex problem usually leads to a suboptimal solution of the original rank minimization problem. In this paper, we propose to perform a family of nonconvex surrogates of $L_0$-norm on the singular values of a matrix to approximate the rank function. This leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth minimization problem. Then we propose to solve the problem by Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) algorithm. IRNN iteratively solves a Weighted Singular Value Thresholding (WSVT) problem, which has a closed form solution due to the special properties of the nonconvex surrogate functions. We also extend IRNN to solve the nonconvex problem with two or more blocks of variables. In theory, we prove that IRNN decreases the objective function value monotonically, and any limit point is a stationary point. Extensive experiments on both synthesized data and real images demonstrate that IRNN enhances the low-rank matrix recovery compared with state-of-the-art convex algorithms.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a method for 3D segmentation of kidneys from patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and severe renal insufficiency, using computed tomography (CT) data. ADPKD severely alters the shape of the kidneys due to non-uniform formation of cysts. As a consequence, fully automatic segmentation of such kidneys is very challenging. We present a segmentation method with minimal user interaction based on a random forest classifier. One of the major novelties of the proposed approach is the usage of geodesic distance volumes as additional source of information. These volumes contain the intensity weighted distance to a manual outline of the respective kidney in only one slice (for each kidney) of the CT volume. We evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively on 55 CT acquisitions using ground truth annotations from clinical experts.

- **Summary**: Deep convolutional neural networks have become the gold standard for image recognition tasks, demonstrating many current state-of-the-art results and even achieving near-human level performance on some tasks. Despite this fact it has been shown that their strong generalisation qualities can be fooled to misclassify previously correctly classified natural images and give erroneous high confidence classifications to nonsense synthetic images. In this paper we extend that work, by presenting a straightforward way to perturb an image in such a way as to cause it to acquire any other label from within the dataset while leaving this perturbed image visually indistinguishable from the original.

- **Summary**: The goal of this paper is to recognize actions in video without the need for examples. Different from traditional zero-shot approaches we do not demand the design and specification of attribute classifiers and class-to-attribute mappings to allow for transfer from seen classes to unseen classes. Our key contribution is objects2action, a semantic word embedding that is spanned by a skip-gram model of thousands of object categories. Action labels are assigned to an object encoding of unseen video based on a convex combination of action and object affinities. Our semantic embedding has three main characteristics to accommodate for the specifics of actions. First, we propose a mechanism to exploit multiple-word descriptions of actions and objects. Second, we incorporate the automated selection of the most responsive objects per action. And finally, we demonstrate how to extend our zero-shot approach to the spatio-temporal localization of actions in video. Experiments on four action datasets demonstrate the potential of our approach.

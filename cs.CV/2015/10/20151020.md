- **Summary**: Periodic inspections are necessary to keep railroad tracks in state of good repair and prevent train accidents. Automatic track inspection using machine vision technology has become a very effective inspection tool. Because of its non-contact nature, this technology can be deployed on virtually any railway vehicle to continuously survey the tracks and send exception reports to track maintenance personnel. However, as appearance and imaging conditions vary, false alarm rates can dramatically change, making it difficult to select a good operating point. In this paper, we use extreme value theory (EVT) within a Bayesian framework to optimally adjust the sensitivity of anomaly detectors. We show that by approximating the lower tail of the probability density function (PDF) of the scores with an Exponential distribution (a special case of the Generalized Pareto distribution), and using the Gamma conjugate prior learned from the training data, it is possible to reduce the variability in false alarm rate and improve the overall performance. This method has shown an increase in the defect detection rate of rail fasteners in the presence of clutter (at PFA 0.1%) from 95.40% to 99.26% on the 85-mile Northeast Corridor (NEC) 2012-2013 concrete tie dataset.

- **Summary**: We use Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields to perform skeleton-based pointing gesture classification at each time instance of a video sequence, where we achieve a frame-wise pointing accuracy of roughly 83%. Subsequently, we determine continuous time sequences of arbitrary length that form individual pointing gestures and this way reliably detect pointing gestures at a false positive detection rate of 0.63%.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral unmixing is aimed at identifying the reference spectral signatures composing an hyperspectral image and their relative abundance fractions in each pixel. In practice, the identified signatures may vary spectrally from an image to another due to varying acquisition conditions, thus inducing possibly significant estimation errors. Against this background, hyperspectral unmixing of several images acquired over the same area is of considerable interest. Indeed, such an analysis enables the endmembers of the scene to be tracked and the corresponding endmember variability to be characterized. Sequential endmember estimation from a set of hyperspectral images is expected to provide improved performance when compared to methods analyzing the images independently. However, the significant size of hyperspectral data precludes the use of batch procedures to jointly estimate the mixture parameters of a sequence of hyperspectral images. Provided that each elementary component is present in at least one image of the sequence, we propose to perform an online hyperspectral unmixing accounting for temporal endmember variability. The online hyperspectral unmixing is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program, which can be solved using a stochastic approximation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real data. A comparison with independent unmixing algorithms finally illustrates the interest of the proposed strategy.

- **Summary**: We present a method for extracting depth information from a rectified image pair. Our approach focuses on the first stage of many stereo algorithms: the matching cost computation. We approach the problem by learning a similarity measure on small image patches using a convolutional neural network. Training is carried out in a supervised manner by constructing a binary classification data set with examples of similar and dissimilar pairs of patches. We examine two network architectures for this task: one tuned for speed, the other for accuracy. The output of the convolutional neural network is used to initialize the stereo matching cost. A series of post-processing steps follow: cross-based cost aggregation, semiglobal matching, a left-right consistency check, subpixel enhancement, a median filter, and a bilateral filter. We evaluate our method on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Middlebury stereo data sets and show that it outperforms other approaches on all three data sets.

- **Summary**: Matrix rank minimization problem is in general NP-hard. The nuclear norm is used to substitute the rank function in many recent studies. Nevertheless, the nuclear norm approximation adds all singular values together and the approximation error may depend heavily on the magnitudes of singular values. This might restrict its capability in dealing with many practical problems. In this paper, an arctangent function is used as a tighter approximation to the rank function. We use it on the challenging subspace clustering problem. For this nonconvex minimization problem, we develop an effective optimization procedure based on a type of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) method. Extensive experiments on face clustering and motion segmentation show that the proposed method is effective for rank approximation.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we study the problem of answering visual analogy questions. These questions take the form of image A is to image B as image C is to what. Answering these questions entails discovering the mapping from image A to image B and then extending the mapping to image C and searching for the image D such that the relation from A to B holds for C to D. We pose this problem as learning an embedding that encourages pairs of analogous images with similar transformations to be close together using convolutional neural networks with a quadruple Siamese architecture. We introduce a dataset of visual analogy questions in natural images, and show first results of its kind on solving analogy questions on natural images.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a novel postprocessing technique for compression-artifact reduction. Our approach is based on posing this task as an inverse problem, with a regularization that leverages on existing state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms. We rely on the recently proposed Plug-and-Play Prior framework, suggesting the solution of general inverse problems via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), leading to a sequence of Gaussian denoising steps. A key feature in our scheme is a linearization of the compression-decompression process, so as to get a formulation that can be optimized. In addition, we supply a thorough analysis of this linear approximation for several basic compression procedures. The proposed method is suitable for diverse compression techniques that rely on transform coding. Specifically, we demonstrate impressive gains in image quality for several leading compression methods - JPEG, JPEG2000, and HEVC.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel end-to-end deep architecture for face landmark detection, based on a deep convolutional and deconvolutional network followed by carefully designed recurrent network structures. The pipeline of this architecture consists of three parts. Through the first part, we encode an input face image to resolution-preserved deconvolutional feature maps via a deep network with stacked convolutional and deconvolutional layers. Then, in the second part, we estimate the initial coordinates of the facial key points by an additional convolutional layer on top of these deconvolutional feature maps. In the last part, by using the deconvolutional feature maps and the initial facial key points as input, we refine the coordinates of the facial key points by a recurrent network that consists of multiple Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) components. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed deep architecture has superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for accurately localizing ground vehicles with the aid of satellite imagery. Our approach takes a ground image as input, and outputs the location from which it was taken on a georeferenced satellite image. We perform visual localization by estimating the co-occurrence probabilities between the ground and satellite images based on a ground-satellite feature dictionary. The method is able to estimate likelihoods over arbitrary locations without the need for a dense ground image database. We present a ranking-loss based algorithm that learns location-discriminative feature projection matrices that result in further improvements in accuracy. We evaluate our method on the Malaga and KITTI public datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline that performs exhaustive search.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral target detection algorithms rely on knowing the desired target signature in advance. However, obtaining an effective target signature can be difficult; signatures obtained from laboratory measurements or hand-spectrometers in the field may not transfer to airborne imagery effectively. One approach to dealing with this difficulty is to learn an effective target signature from training data. An approach for learning target signatures from training data is presented. The proposed approach addresses uncertainty and imprecision in groundtruth in the training data using a multiple instance learning, diverse density (DD) based objective function. After learning the target signature given data with uncertain and imprecise groundtruth, target detection can be applied on test data. Results are shown on simulated and real data.

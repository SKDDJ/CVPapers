- **Summary**: Efficient Human Epithelial-2 (HEp-2) cell image classification can facilitate the diagnosis of many autoimmune diseases. This paper presents an automatic framework for this classification task, by utilizing the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have recently attracted intensive attention in visual recognition. This paper elaborates the important components of this framework, discusses multiple key factors that impact the efficiency of training a deep CNN, and systematically compares this framework with the well-established image classification models in the literature. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that i) the proposed framework can effectively outperform existing models by properly applying data augmentation; ii) our CNN-based framework demonstrates excellent adaptability across different datasets, which is highly desirable for classification under varying laboratory settings. Our system is ranked high in the cell image classification competition hosted by ICPR 2014.

- **Summary**: We present an improved model and theory for time-causal and time-recursive spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on a combination of Gaussian receptive fields over the spatial domain and first-order integrators or equivalently truncated exponential filters coupled in cascade over the temporal domain.   Compared to previous spatio-temporal scale-space formulations in terms of non-enhancement of local extrema or scale invariance, these receptive fields are based on different scale-space axiomatics over time by ensuring non-creation of new local extrema or zero-crossings with increasing temporal scale. Specifically, extensions are presented about (i) parameterizing the intermediate temporal scale levels, (ii) analysing the resulting temporal dynamics, (iii) transferring the theory to a discrete implementation, (iv) computing scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative expressions for spatio-temporal feature detection and (v) computational modelling of receptive fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1) in biological vision.   We show that by distributing the intermediate temporal scale levels according to a logarithmic distribution, we obtain much faster temporal response properties (shorter temporal delays) compared to a uniform distribution. Specifically, these kernels converge very rapidly to a limit kernel possessing true self-similar scale-invariant properties over temporal scales, thereby allowing for true scale invariance over variations in the temporal scale, although the underlying temporal scale-space representation is based on a discretized temporal scale parameter.   We show how scale-normalized temporal derivatives can be defined for these time-causal scale-space kernels and how the composed theory can be used for computing basic types of scale-normalized spatio-temporal derivative expressions in a computationally efficient manner.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we analyze 48 signals of rest tremor velocity related to 12 distinct subjects affected by Parkinson's disease. The subjects belong to two different groups, formed by four and eight subjects with, respectively, high- and low-amplitude rest tremors. Each subject is tested in four settings, given by combining the use of deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA medication. We develop two main feature-based representations of such signals, which are obtained by considering (i) the long-term correlations and multifractal properties, and (ii) the power spectra. The feature-based representations are initially utilized for the purpose of characterizing the subjects under different settings. In agreement with previous studies, we show that deep brain stimulation does not significantly characterize neither of the two groups, regardless of the adopted representation. On the other hand, the medication effect yields statistically significant differences in both high- and low-amplitude tremor groups. We successively test several different instances of the two feature-based representations of the signals in the setting of supervised classification and (nonlinear) feature transformation. We consider three different classification problems, involving the recognition of (i) the presence of medication, (ii) the use of deep brain stimulation, and (iii) the membership to the high- and low-amplitude tremor groups. Classification results show that the use of medication can be discriminated with higher accuracy, considering many of the feature-based representations. Notably, we show that the best results are obtained with a parsimonious, two-dimensional representation encoding the long-term correlations and multifractal character of the signals.

- **Summary**: Separating active regions that are quiet from potentially eruptive ones is a key issue in Space Weather applications. Traditional classification schemes such as Mount Wilson and McIntosh have been effective in relating an active region large scale magnetic configuration to its ability to produce eruptive events. However, their qualitative nature prevents systematic studies of an active region's evolution for example. We introduce a new clustering of active regions that is based on the local geometry observed in Line of Sight magnetogram and continuum images. We use a reduced-dimension representation of an active region that is obtained by factoring the corresponding data matrix comprised of local image patches. Two factorizations can be compared via the definition of appropriate metrics on the resulting factors. The distances obtained from these metrics are then used to cluster the active regions. We find that these metrics result in natural clusterings of active regions. The clusterings are related to large scale descriptors of an active region such as its size, its local magnetic field distribution, and its complexity as measured by the Mount Wilson classification scheme. We also find that including data focused on the neutral line of an active region can result in an increased correspondence between our clustering results and other active region descriptors such as the Mount Wilson classifications and the $R$ value. We provide some recommendations for which metrics, matrix factorization techniques, and regions of interest to use to study active regions.

- **Summary**: Classifiers with rejection are essential in real-world applications where misclassifications and their effects are critical. However, if no problem specific cost function is defined, there are no established measures to assess the performance of such classifiers. We introduce a set of desired properties for performance measures for classifiers with rejection, based on which we propose a set of three performance measures for the evaluation of the performance of classifiers with rejection that satisfy the desired properties. The nonrejected accuracy measures the ability of the classifier to accurately classify nonrejected samples; the classification quality measures the correct decision making of the classifier with rejector; and the rejection quality measures the ability to concentrate all misclassified samples onto the set of rejected samples. From the measures, we derive the concept of relative optimality that allows us to connect the measures to a family of cost functions that take into account the trade-off between rejection and misclassification. We illustrate the use of the proposed performance measures on classifiers with rejection applied to synthetic and real-world data.

- **Summary**: Despite the fact that object detection, 3D pose estimation, and sub-category recognition are highly correlated tasks, they are usually addressed independently from each other because of the huge space of parameters. To jointly model all of these tasks, we propose a coarse-to-fine hierarchical representation, where each level of the hierarchy represents objects at a different level of granularity. The hierarchical representation prevents performance loss, which is often caused by the increase in the number of parameters (as we consider more tasks to model), and the joint modelling enables resolving ambiguities that exist in independent modelling of these tasks. We augment PASCAL3D+ dataset with annotations for these tasks and show that our hierarchical model is effective in joint modelling of object detection, 3D pose estimation, and sub-category recognition.

- **Summary**: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have made driving safer over the last decade. They prepare vehicles for unsafe road conditions and alert drivers if they perform a dangerous maneuver. However, many accidents are unavoidable because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late. Anticipating maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the maneuver and also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger.   In this work we anticipate driving maneuvers a few seconds before they occur. For this purpose we equip a car with cameras and a computing device to capture the driving context from both inside and outside of the car. We propose an Autoregressive Input-Output HMM to model the contextual information alongwith the maneuvers. We evaluate our approach on a diverse data set with 1180 miles of natural freeway and city driving and show that we can anticipate maneuvers 3.5 seconds before they occur with over 80\% F1-score in real-time.

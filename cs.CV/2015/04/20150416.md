- **Summary**: Cameras for imaging in short and mid-wave infrared spectra are significantly more expensive than their counterparts in visible imaging. As a result, high-resolution imaging in those spectrum remains beyond the reach of most consumers. Over the last decade, compressive sensing (CS) has emerged as a potential means to realize inexpensive short-wave infrared cameras. One approach for doing this is the single-pixel camera (SPC) where a single detector acquires coded measurements of a high-resolution image. A computational reconstruction algorithm is then used to recover the image from these coded measurements. Unfortunately, the measurement rate of a SPC is insufficient to enable imaging at high spatial and temporal resolutions.   We present a focal plane array-based compressive sensing (FPA-CS) architecture that achieves high spatial and temporal resolutions. The idea is to use an array of SPCs that sense in parallel to increase the measurement rate, and consequently, the achievable spatio-temporal resolution of the camera. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype in the short-wave infrared using a sensor with 64$\times$ 64 pixels; the prototype provides a 4096$\times$ increase in the measurement rate compared to the SPC and achieves a megapixel resolution at video rate using CS techniques.

- **Summary**: We propose Ordered Subspace Clustering (OSC) to segment data drawn from a sequentially ordered union of subspaces. Similar to Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) we formulate the problem as one of finding a sparse representation but include an additional penalty term to take care of sequential data. We test our method on data drawn from infrared hyper spectral, video and motion capture data. Experiments show that our method, OSC, outperforms the state of the art methods: Spatial Subspace Clustering (SpatSC), Low-Rank Representation (LRR) and SSC.

- **Summary**: Automated face recognition and identification softwares are becoming part of our daily life; it finds its abode not only with Facebook's auto photo tagging, Apple's iPhoto, Google's Picasa, Microsoft's Kinect, but also in Homeland Security Department's dedicated biometric face detection systems. Most of these automatic face identification systems fail where the effects of aging come into the picture. Little work exists in the literature on the subject of face prediction that accounts for aging, which is a vital part of the computer face recognition systems. In recent years, individual face components' (e.g. eyes, nose, mouth) features based matching algorithms have emerged, but these approaches are still not efficient. Therefore, in this work we describe a Face Prediction Model (FPM), which predicts human face aging or growth related image variation using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning techniques. The FPM captures the facial changes, which occur with human aging and predicts the facial image with a few years of gap with an acceptable accuracy of face matching from 76 to 86%.

- **Summary**: We present Caffe con Troll (CcT), a fully compatible end-to-end version of the popular framework Caffe with rebuilt internals. We built CcT to examine the performance characteristics of training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks across different hardware architectures. We find that, by employing standard batching optimizations for CPU training, we achieve a 4.5x throughput improvement over Caffe on popular networks like CaffeNet. Moreover, with these improvements, the end-to-end training time for CNNs is directly proportional to the FLOPS delivered by the CPU, which enables us to efficiently train hybrid CPU-GPU systems for CNNs.

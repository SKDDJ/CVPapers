- **Summary**: This paper proposes a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method (Fast R-CNN) for object detection. Fast R-CNN builds on previous work to efficiently classify object proposals using deep convolutional networks. Compared to previous work, Fast R-CNN employs several innovations to improve training and testing speed while also increasing detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate. Fast R-CNN is implemented in Python and C++ (using Caffe) and is available under the open-source MIT License at https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn.

- **Summary**: Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised method for learning low-dimensional features with orthogonal projections. Multilinear PCA methods extend PCA to deal with multidimensional data (tensors) directly via tensor-to-tensor projection or tensor-to-vector projection (TVP). However, under the TVP setting, it is difficult to develop an effective multilinear PCA method with the orthogonality constraint. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a novel Semi-Orthogonal Multilinear PCA (SO-MPCA) approach. SO-MPCA learns low-dimensional features directly from tensors via TVP by imposing the orthogonality constraint in only one mode. This formulation results in more captured variance and more learned features than full orthogonality. For better generalization, we further introduce a relaxed start (RS) strategy to get SO-MPCA-RS by fixing the starting projection vectors, which increases the bias and reduces the variance of the learning model. Experiments on both face (2D) and gait (3D) data demonstrate that SO-MPCA-RS outperforms other competing algorithms on the whole, and the relaxed start strategy is also effective for other TVP-based PCA methods.

### Predicting People's 3D Poses from Short Sequences

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose an efficient approach to exploiting motion information from consecutive frames of a video sequence to recover the 3D pose of people. Instead of computing candidate poses in individual frames and then linking them, as is often done, we regress directly from a spatio-temporal block of frames to a 3D pose in the central one. We will demonstrate that this approach allows us to effectively overcome ambiguities and to improve upon the state-of-the-art on challenging sequences.

- **Summary**: To train good supervised and semi-supervised object classifiers, it is critical that we not waste the time of the human experts who are providing the training labels. Existing active learning strategies can have uneven performance, being efficient on some datasets but wasteful on others, or inconsistent just between runs on the same dataset. We propose perplexity based graph construction and a new hierarchical subquery evaluation algorithm to combat this variability, and to release the potential of Expected Error Reduction.   Under some specific circumstances, Expected Error Reduction has been one of the strongest-performing informativeness criteria for active learning. Until now, it has also been prohibitively costly to compute for sizeable datasets. We demonstrate our highly practical algorithm, comparing it to other active learning measures on classification datasets that vary in sparsity, dimensionality, and size. Our algorithm is consistent over multiple runs and achieves high accuracy, while querying the human expert for labels at a frequency that matches their desired time budget.

- **Summary**: Part models of object categories are essential for challenging recognition tasks, where differences in categories are subtle and only reflected in appearances of small parts of the object. We present an approach that is able to learn part models in a completely unsupervised manner, without part annotations and even without given bounding boxes during learning. The key idea is to find constellations of neural activation patterns computed using convolutional neural networks. In our experiments, we outperform existing approaches for fine-grained recognition on the CUB200-2011, NA birds, Oxford PETS, and Oxford Flowers dataset in case no part or bounding box annotations are available and achieve state-of-the-art performance for the Stanford Dog dataset. We also show the benefits of neural constellation models as a data augmentation technique for fine-tuning. Furthermore, our paper unites the areas of generic and fine-grained classification, since our approach is suitable for both scenarios.

- **Summary**: Our proposed hyper kurtosis based histogram equalized DIC images enhances the contrast by preserving the brightness. The evolution and development of precancerous activity among tissues are studied through S-transform (ST). The significant variations of amplitude spectra can be observed due to increased medium roughness from normal tissue were observed in time-frequency domain. The randomness and inhomogeneity of the tissue structures among human normal and different grades of DIC tissues is recognized by ST based timefrequency analysis. This study offers a simpler and better way to recognize the substantial changes among different stages of DIC tissues, which are reflected by spatial information containing within the inhomogeneity structures of different types of tissue.

- **Summary**: Surface topography refers to the geometric micro-structure of a surface and defines its tactile characteristics (typically in the sub-millimeter range). High-resolution 3D scanning techniques developed recently enable the 3D reconstruction of surfaces including their surface topography. In his paper, we present an efficient image-space technique for the extraction of surface topography from high-resolution 3D reconstructions. Additionally, we filter noise and enhance topographic attributes to obtain an improved representation for subsequent topography classification. Comprehensive experiments show that the our representation captures well topographic attributes and significantly improves classification performance compared to alternative 2D and 3D representations.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach to reduce the computational cost of evaluation of convolutional neural networks, a factor that has hindered their deployment in low-power devices such as mobile phones. Inspired by the loop perforation technique from source code optimization, we speed up the bottleneck convolutional layers by skipping their evaluation in some of the spatial positions. We propose and analyze several strategies of choosing these positions. We demonstrate that perforation can accelerate modern convolutional networks such as AlexNet and VGG-16 by a factor of 2x - 4x. Additionally, we show that perforation is complementary to the recently proposed acceleration method of Zhang et al.

- **Journal**: IJCSI - March 2015 Issue (Volume 12, Issue 2)
- **Summary**: We study the use of overlapping and non-overlapping camera layouts in estimating the ego-motion of a moving robot. To estimate the location and orientation of the robot, we investigate using four cameras as non-overlapping individuals, and as two stereo pairs. The pros and cons of the two approaches are elucidated. The cameras work independently and can have larger field of view in the non-overlapping layout. However, a scale factor ambiguity should be dealt with. On the other hand, stereo systems provide more accuracy but require establishing feature correspondence with more computational demand. For both approaches, the extended Kalman filter is used as a real-time recursive estimator. The approaches studied are verified with synthetic and real experiments alike.

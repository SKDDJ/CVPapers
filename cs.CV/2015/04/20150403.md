- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach, based on polynomial optimization and the method of moments, to the problem of anomaly detection. The proposed technique only requires information about the statistical moments of the normal-state distribution of the features of interest and compares favorably with existing approaches (such as Parzen windows and 1-class SVM). In addition, it provides a succinct description of the normal state. Thus, it leads to a substantial simplification of the the anomaly detection problem when working with higher dimensional datasets.

- **Summary**: Learned feature representations and sub-phoneme posteriors from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been used separately to produce significant performance gains for speaker and language recognition tasks. In this work we show how these gains are possible using a single DNN for both speaker and language recognition. The unified DNN approach is shown to yield substantial performance improvements on the the 2013 Domain Adaptation Challenge speaker recognition task (55% reduction in EER for the out-of-domain condition) and on the NIST 2011 Language Recognition Evaluation (48% reduction in EER for the 30s test condition).

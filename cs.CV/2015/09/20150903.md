- **Summary**: Human motion analysis and understanding has been, and is still, the focus of attention of many disciplines which is considered an obvious indicator of the wide and massive importance of the subject. The purpose of this article is to shed some light on this very important subject, so it can be a good insight for a novice computer vision researcher in this field by providing him/her with a wealth of knowledge about the subject covering many directions. There are two main contributions of this article. The first one investigates various aspects of some disciplines (e.g., arts, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience) that are interested in the subject and review some of their contributions stressing on those that can be useful for computer vision researchers. Moreover, many examples are illustrated to indicate the benefits of integrating concepts and results among different disciplines. The second contribution is concerned with the subject from the computer vision aspect where we discuss the following issues. First, we explore many demanding and promising applications to reveal the wide and massive importance of the field. Second, we list various types of sensors that may be used for acquiring various data. Third, we review different taxonomies used for classifying motions. Fourth, we review various processes involved in motion analysis. Fifth, we exhibit how different surveys are structured. Sixth, we examine many of the most cited and recent reviews in the field that have been published during the past two decades to reveal various approaches used for implementing different stages of the problem and refer to various algorithms and their suitability for different situations. Moreover, we provide a long list of public datasets and discuss briefly some examples of these datasets. Finally, we provide a general discussion of the subject from the aspect of computer vision.

- **Summary**: Road detection is a fundamental task in autonomous navigation systems. In this paper, we consider the case of monocular road detection, where images are segmented into road and non-road regions. Our starting point is the well-known machine learning approach, in which a classifier is trained to distinguish road and non-road regions based on hand-labeled images. We proceed by introducing the use of "contextual blocks" as an efficient way of providing contextual information to the classifier. Overall, the proposed methodology, including its image feature selection and classifier, was conceived with computational cost in mind, leaving room for optimized implementations. Regarding experiments, we perform a sensible evaluation of each phase and feature subset that composes our system. The results show a great benefit from using contextual blocks and demonstrate their computational efficiency. Finally, we submit our results to the KITTI road detection benchmark achieving scores comparable with state of the art methods.

- **Summary**: An important logistics application of robotics involves manipulators that pick-and-place objects placed in warehouse shelves. A critical aspect of this task corre- sponds to detecting the pose of a known object in the shelf using visual data. Solving this problem can be assisted by the use of an RGB-D sensor, which also provides depth information beyond visual data. Nevertheless, it remains a challenging problem since multiple issues need to be addressed, such as low illumination inside shelves, clutter, texture-less and reflective objects as well as the limitations of depth sensors. This paper provides a new rich data set for advancing the state-of-the-art in RGBD- based 3D object pose estimation, which is focused on the challenges that arise when solving warehouse pick- and-place tasks. The publicly available data set includes thousands of images and corresponding ground truth data for the objects used during the first Amazon Picking Challenge at different poses and clutter conditions. Each image is accompanied with ground truth information to assist in the evaluation of algorithms for object detection. To show the utility of the data set, a recent algorithm for RGBD-based pose estimation is evaluated in this paper. Based on the measured performance of the algorithm on the data set, various modifications and improvements are applied to increase the accuracy of detection. These steps can be easily applied to a variety of different methodologies for object pose detection and improve performance in the domain of warehouse pick-and-place.

- **Summary**: We introduce a new supervised algorithm for image classification with rejection using multiscale contextual information. Rejection is desired in image-classification applications that require a robust classifier but not the classification of the entire image. The proposed algorithm combines local and multiscale contextual information with rejection, improving the classification performance. As a probabilistic model for classification, we adopt a multinomial logistic regression. The concept of rejection with contextual information is implemented by modeling the classification problem as an energy minimization problem over a graph representing local and multiscale similarities of the image. The rejection is introduced through an energy data term associated with the classification risk and the contextual information through an energy smoothness term associated with the local and multiscale similarities within the image. We illustrate the proposed method on the classification of images of H&E-stained teratoma tissues.

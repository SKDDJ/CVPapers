- **Summary**: We describe an end-to-end generative approach for the segmentation and recognition of human activities. In this approach, a visual representation based on reduced Fisher Vectors is combined with a structured temporal model for recognition. We show that the statistical properties of Fisher Vectors make them an especially suitable front-end for generative models such as Gaussian mixtures. The system is evaluated for both the recognition of complex activities as well as their parsing into action units. Using a variety of video datasets ranging from human cooking activities to animal behaviors, our experiments demonstrate that the resulting architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for larger datasets, i.e. when sufficient amount of data is available for training structured generative models.

- **Summary**: Evolution of visual object recognition architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks & Convolutional Deep Belief Networks paradigms has revolutionized artificial Vision Science. These architectures extract & learn the real world hierarchical visual features utilizing supervised & unsupervised learning approaches respectively. Both the approaches yet cannot scale up realistically to provide recognition for a very large number of objects as high as 10K. We propose a two level hierarchical deep learning architecture inspired by divide & conquer principle that decomposes the large scale recognition architecture into root & leaf level model architectures. Each of the root & leaf level models is trained exclusively to provide superior results than possible by any 1-level deep learning architecture prevalent today. The proposed architecture classifies objects in two steps. In the first step the root level model classifies the object in a high level category. In the second step, the leaf level recognition model for the recognized high level category is selected among all the leaf models. This leaf level model is presented with the same input object image which classifies it in a specific category. Also we propose a blend of leaf level models trained with either supervised or unsupervised learning approaches. Unsupervised learning is suitable whenever labelled data is scarce for the specific leaf level models. Currently the training of leaf level models is in progress; where we have trained 25 out of the total 47 leaf level models as of now. We have trained the leaf models with the best case top-5 error rate of 3.2% on the validation data set for the particular leaf models. Also we demonstrate that the validation error of the leaf level models saturates towards the above mentioned accuracy as the number of epochs are increased to more than sixty.

- **Summary**: The paper presents a new script classification method for the discrimination of the South Slavic medieval labels. It consists in the textural analysis of the script types. In the first step, each letter is coded by the equivalent script type, which is defined by its typographical features. Obtained coded text is subjected to the run-length statistical analysis and to the adjacent local binary pattern analysis in order to extract the features. The result shows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes the feature classification more effective. It is the basis for the classification process of the script identification by using an extension of a state-of-the-art approach for document clustering. The proposed method is evaluated on an example of hand-engraved in stone and hand-printed in paper labels in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic. Experiments demonstrate very positive results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.



### A New Low-Rank Tensor Model for Video Completion

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new low-rank tensor model based on the circulant algebra, namely, twist tensor nuclear norm or t-TNN for short. The twist tensor denotes a 3-way tensor representation to laterally store 2D data slices in order. On one hand, t-TNN convexly relaxes the tensor multi-rank of the twist tensor in the Fourier domain, which allows an efficient computation using FFT. On the other, t-TNN is equal to the nuclear norm of block circulant matricization of the twist tensor in the original domain, which extends the traditional matrix nuclear norm in a block circulant way. We test the t-TNN model on a video completion application that aims to fill missing values and the experiment results validate its effectiveness, especially when dealing with video recorded by a non-stationary panning camera. The block circulant matricization of the twist tensor can be transformed into a circulant block representation with nuclear norm invariance. This representation, after transformation, exploits the horizontal translation relationship between the frames in a video, and endows the t-TNN model with a more powerful ability to reconstruct panning videos than the existing state-of-the-art low-rank models.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a method for future localization: to predict a set of plausible trajectories of ego-motion given a depth image. We predict paths avoiding obstacles, between objects, even paths turning around a corner into space behind objects. As a byproduct of the predicted trajectories of ego-motion, we discover in the image the empty space occluded by foreground objects. We use no image based features such as semantic labeling/segmentation or object detection/recognition for this algorithm. Inspired by proxemics, we represent the space around a person using an EgoSpace map, akin to an illustrated tourist map, that measures a likelihood of occlusion at the egocentric coordinate system. A future trajectory of ego-motion is modeled by a linear combination of compact trajectory bases allowing us to constrain the predicted trajectory. We learn the relationship between the EgoSpace map and trajectory from the EgoMotion dataset providing in-situ measurements of the future trajectory. A cost function that takes into account partial occlusion due to foreground objects is minimized to predict a trajectory. This cost function generates a trajectory that passes through the occluded space, which allows us to discover the empty space behind the foreground objects. We quantitatively evaluate our method to show predictive validity and apply to various real world scenes including walking, shopping, and social interactions.

- **Summary**: Segmenting an image into multiple components is a central task in computer vision. In many practical scenarios, prior knowledge about plausible components is available. Incorporating such prior knowledge into models and algorithms for image segmentation is highly desirable, yet can be non-trivial. In this work, we introduce a new approach that allows, for the first time, to constrain some or all components of a segmentation to have convex shapes. Specifically, we extend the Minimum Cost Multicut Problem by a class of constraints that enforce convexity. To solve instances of this APX-hard integer linear program to optimality, we separate the proposed constraints in the branch-and-cut loop of a state-of-the-art ILP solver. Results on natural and biological images demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach as well as its advantage over the state-of-the-art heuristic.

- **Summary**: We address the task of annotating images with semantic tuples. Solving this problem requires an algorithm which is able to deal with hundreds of classes for each argument of the tuple. In such contexts, data sparsity becomes a key challenge, as there will be a large number of classes for which only a few examples are available. We propose handling this by incorporating feature representations of both the inputs (images) and outputs (argument classes) into a factorized log-linear model, and exploiting the flexibility of scoring functions based on bilinear forms. Experiments show that integrating feature representations of the outputs in the structured prediction model leads to better overall predictions. We also conclude that the best output representation is specific for each type of argument.

- **Summary**: Errors in the data and the forward operator of an inverse problem can be handily modelled using partial order in Banach lattices. We present some existing results of the theory of regularisation in this novel framework, where errors are represented as bounds by means of the appropriate partial order.   We apply the theory to Diffusion Tensor Imaging, where correct noise modelling is challenging: it involves the Rician distribution and the nonlinear Stejskal-Tanner equation. Linearisation of the latter in the statistical framework would complicate the noise model even further. We avoid this using the error bounds approach, which preserves simple error structure under monotone transformations.

- **Summary**: Humans connect language and vision to perceive the world. How to build a similar connection for computers? One possible way is via visual concepts, which are text terms that relate to visually discriminative entities. We propose an automatic visual concept discovery algorithm using parallel text and visual corpora; it filters text terms based on the visual discriminative power of the associated images, and groups them into concepts using visual and semantic similarities. We illustrate the applications of the discovered concepts using bidirectional image and sentence retrieval task and image tagging task, and show that the discovered concepts not only outperform several large sets of manually selected concepts significantly, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the retrieval task.

- **Summary**: Validation of image segmentation methods is of critical importance. Probabilistic image segmentation is increasingly popular as it captures uncertainty in the results. Image segmentation methods that support multi-region (as opposed to binary) delineation are more favourable as they capture interactions between the different objects in the image. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) has been a popular metric for evaluating the accuracy of automated or semi-automated segmentation methods by comparing their results to the ground truth. In this work, we develop an extension of the DSC to multi-region probabilistic segmentations (with unordered labels). We use bipartite graph matching to establish label correspondences and propose two functions that extend the DSC, one based on absolute probability differences and one based on the Aitchison distance. These provide a robust and accurate measure of multi-region probabilistic segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: With the rapid proliferation of smart mobile devices, users now take millions of photos every day. These include large numbers of clothing and accessory images. We would like to answer questions like `What outfit goes well with this pair of shoes?' To answer these types of questions, one has to go beyond learning visual similarity and learn a visual notion of compatibility across categories. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to help answer these types of questions. The main idea of this framework is to learn a feature transformation from images of items into a latent space that expresses compatibility. For the feature transformation, we use a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, where training examples are pairs of items that are either compatible or incompatible. We model compatibility based on co-occurrence in large-scale user behavior data; in particular co-purchase data from Amazon.com. To learn cross-category fit, we introduce a strategic method to sample training data, where pairs of items are heterogeneous dyads, i.e., the two elements of a pair belong to different high-level categories. While this approach is applicable to a wide variety of settings, we focus on the representative problem of learning compatible clothing style. Our results indicate that the proposed framework is capable of learning semantic information about visual style and is able to generate outfits of clothes, with items from different categories, that go well together.

- **Summary**: This paper presents our work on "SNaCK," a low-dimensional concept embedding algorithm that combines human expertise with automatic machine similarity kernels. Both parts are complimentary: human insight can capture relationships that are not apparent from the object's visual similarity and the machine can help relieve the human from having to exhaustively specify many constraints. We show that our SNaCK embeddings are useful in several tasks: distinguishing prime and nonprime numbers on MNIST, discovering labeling mistakes in the Caltech UCSD Birds (CUB) dataset with the help of deep-learned features, creating training datasets for bird classifiers, capturing subjective human taste on a new dataset of 10,000 foods, and qualitatively exploring an unstructured set of pictographic characters. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art in these tasks show that SNaCK produces better concept embeddings that require less human supervision than the leading methods.

- **Summary**: When crowdsourcing systems are used in combination with machine inference systems in the real world, they benefit the most when the machine system is deeply integrated with the crowd workers. However, if researchers wish to integrate the crowd with "off-the-shelf" machine classifiers, this deep integration is not always possible. This work explores two strategies to increase accuracy and decrease cost under this setting. First, we show that reordering tasks presented to the human can create a significant accuracy improvement. Further, we show that greedily choosing parameters to maximize machine accuracy is sub-optimal, and joint optimization of the combined system improves performance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the task of Optical Character Recognition(OCR) for the Telugu script. We present an end-to-end framework that segments the text image, classifies the characters and extracts lines using a language model. The segmentation is based on mathematical morphology. The classification module, which is the most challenging task of the three, is a deep convolutional neural network. The language is modelled as a third degree markov chain at the glyph level. Telugu script is a complex alphasyllabary and the language is agglutinative, making the problem hard. In this paper we apply the latest advances in neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art error rates. We also review convolutional neural networks in great detail and expound the statistical justification behind the many tricks needed to make Deep Learning work.

- **Comment**: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to part-based
  representation. On one hand, not all data can be successfully identified as
  'parts' by NMF. On the other hand, inverse sparse representation could not
  fit this situation. I will give a clearer explanation from clustering instead
  of part-based representation

- **Summary**: The establishment of robust target appearance model over time is an overriding concern in visual tracking. In this paper, we propose an inverse nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method for robust appearance modeling. Rather than using a linear combination of nonnegative basis matrices for each target image patch in the conventional NMF, the proposed method is a reverse thought to conventional NMF tracker. It utilizes both the foreground and background information, and imposes a local coordinate constraint, where the basis matrix is sparse matrix from the linear combination of candidates with corresponding nonnegative coefficient vectors. Inverse NMF is used as a feature encoder, where the resulting coefficient vectors are fed into a SVM classifier for separating the target from the background. The proposed method is tested on several videos and compared with seven state-of-the-art methods. Our results have provided further support to the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a framework that supports the implementation of parallel solutions for the widespread parametric maximum flow computational routines used in image segmentation algorithms. The framework is based on supergraphs, a special construction combining several image graphs into a larger one, and works on various architectures (multi-core or GPU), either locally or remotely in a cluster of computing nodes. The framework can also be used for performance evaluation of parallel implementations of maximum flow algorithms. We present the case study of a state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithm based on graph cuts, Constrained Parametric Min-Cut (CPMC), that uses the parallel framework to solve parametric maximum flow problems, based on a GPU implementation of the well-known push-relabel algorithm. Our results indicate that real-time implementations based on the proposed techniques are possible.

- **Summary**: Conventional single image based localization methods usually fail to localize a querying image when there exist large variations between the querying image and the pre-built scene. To address this, we propose an image-set querying based localization approach. When the localization by a single image fails to work, the system will ask the user to capture more auxiliary images. First, a local 3D model is established for the querying image set. Then, the pose of the querying image set is estimated by solving a nonlinear optimization problem, which aims to match the local 3D model against the pre-built scene. Experiments have shown the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: Several recent approaches showed how the representations learned by Convolutional Neural Networks can be repurposed for novel tasks. Most commonly it has been shown that the activation features of the last fully connected layers (fc7 or fc6) of the network, followed by a linear classifier outperform the state-of-the-art on several recognition challenge datasets. Instead of recognition, this paper focuses on the image retrieval problem and proposes a examines alternative pooling strategies derived for CNN features. The presented scheme uses the features maps from an earlier layer 5 of the CNN architecture, which has been shown to preserve coarse spatial information and is semantically meaningful. We examine several pooling strategies and demonstrate superior performance on the image retrieval task (INRIA Holidays) at the fraction of the computational cost, while using a relatively small memory requirements. In addition to retrieval, we see similar efficiency gains on the SUN397 scene categorization dataset, demonstrating wide applicability of this simple strategy. We also introduce and evaluate a novel GeoPlaces5K dataset from different geographical locations in the world for image retrieval that stresses more dramatic changes in appearance and viewpoint.

- **Summary**: In the medical field, images are increasingly used to facilitate diagnosis of diseases. These images are stored in multimedia databases accompanied by doctor s prescriptions and other information related to patients.Search for medical images has become for clinical applications an essential tool to bring effective aid in diagnosis. Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is one of the possible solutions to effectively manage these databases. Our contribution is to define a relevant descriptor to retrieve images based on multiresolution analysis of texture using Local Binary Pattern LBP. This descriptor once calculated and information s relating to the patient; will be placed in the image using the technique of reversible watermarking. Thereby, the image, descriptor of its contents, the BFILE locator and patientrelated information become a single entity, so even the administrator cannot have access to the patient private data.

- **Summary**: Sentiment analysis of online user generated content is important for many social media analytics tasks. Researchers have largely relied on textual sentiment analysis to develop systems to predict political elections, measure economic indicators, and so on. Recently, social media users are increasingly using images and videos to express their opinions and share their experiences. Sentiment analysis of such large scale visual content can help better extract user sentiments toward events or topics, such as those in image tweets, so that prediction of sentiment from visual content is complementary to textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the needs in leveraging large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of image sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We first design a suitable CNN architecture for image sentiment analysis. We obtain half a million training samples by using a baseline sentiment algorithm to label Flickr images. To make use of such noisy machine labeled data, we employ a progressive strategy to fine-tune the deep network. Furthermore, we improve the performance on Twitter images by inducing domain transfer with a small number of manually labeled Twitter images. We have conducted extensive experiments on manually labeled Twitter images. The results show that the proposed CNN can achieve better performance in image sentiment analysis than competing algorithms.

- **Summary**: The growing amount of data available in modern-day datasets makes the need to efficiently search and retrieve information. To make large-scale search feasible, Distance Estimation and Subset Indexing are the main approaches. Although binary coding has been popular for implementing both techniques, n-ary coding (known as Product Quantization) is also very effective for Distance Estimation. However, their relative performance has not been studied for Subset Indexing. We investigate whether binary or n-ary coding works better under different retrieval strategies. This leads to the design of a new n-ary coding method, "Linear Subspace Quantization (LSQ)" which, unlike other n-ary encoders, can be used as a similarity-preserving embedding. Experiments on image retrieval show that when Distance Estimation is used, n-ary LSQ outperforms other methods. However, when Subset Indexing is applied, interestingly, binary codings are more effective and binary LSQ achieves the best accuracy.

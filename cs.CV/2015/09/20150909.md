- **Summary**: Computational neuroscience studies that have examined human visual system through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have identified a model where the mammalian brain pursues two distinct pathways (for recognition of biological movement tasks). In the brain, dorsal stream analyzes the information of motion (optical flow), which is the fast features, and ventral stream (form pathway) analyzes form information (through active basis model based incremental slow feature analysis ) as slow features. The proposed approach suggests the motion perception of the human visual system composes of fast and slow feature interactions that identifies biological movements. Form features in the visual system biologically follows the application of active basis model with incremental slow feature analysis for the extraction of the slowest form features of human objects movements in the ventral stream. Applying incremental slow feature analysis provides an opportunity to use the action prototypes. To extract the slowest features episodic observation is required but the fast features updates the processing of motion information in every frames. Experimental results have shown promising accuracy for the proposed model and good performance with two datasets (KTH and Weizmann).

- **Summary**: This paper addresses semantic image segmentation by incorporating rich information into Markov Random Field (MRF), including high-order relations and mixture of label contexts. Unlike previous works that optimized MRFs using iterative algorithm, we solve MRF by proposing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Deep Parsing Network (DPN), which enables deterministic end-to-end computation in a single forward pass. Specifically, DPN extends a contemporary CNN architecture to model unary terms and additional layers are carefully devised to approximate the mean field algorithm (MF) for pairwise terms. It has several appealing properties. First, different from the recent works that combined CNN and MRF, where many iterations of MF were required for each training image during back-propagation, DPN is able to achieve high performance by approximating one iteration of MF. Second, DPN represents various types of pairwise terms, making many existing works as its special cases. Third, DPN makes MF easier to be parallelized and speeded up in Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). DPN is thoroughly evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, where a single DPN model yields a new state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.

- **Summary**: Instance-level object segmentation is an important yet under-explored task. The few existing studies are almost all based on region proposal methods to extract candidate segments and then utilize object classification to produce final results. Nonetheless, generating accurate region proposals itself is quite challenging. In this work, we propose a Proposal-Free Network (PFN ) to address the instance-level object segmentation problem, which outputs the instance numbers of different categories and the pixel-level information on 1) the coordinates of the instance bounding box each pixel belongs to, and 2) the confidences of different categories for each pixel, based on pixel-to-pixel deep convolutional neural network. All the outputs together, by using any off-the-shelf clustering method for simple post-processing, can naturally generate the ultimate instance-level object segmentation results. The whole PFN can be easily trained in an end-to-end way without the requirement of a proposal generation stage. Extensive evaluations on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmark demonstrate that the proposed PFN solution well beats the state-of-the-arts for instance-level object segmentation. In particular, the $AP^r$ over 20 classes at 0.5 IoU reaches 58.7% by PFN, significantly higher than 43.8% and 46.3% by the state-of-the-art algorithms, SDS [9] and [16], respectively.

- **Summary**: The Shape Interaction Matrix (SIM) is one of the earliest approaches to performing subspace clustering (i.e., separating points drawn from a union of subspaces). In this paper, we revisit the SIM and reveal its connections to several recent subspace clustering methods. Our analysis lets us derive a simple, yet effective algorithm to robustify the SIM and make it applicable to realistic scenarios where the data is corrupted by noise. We justify our method by intuitive examples and the matrix perturbation theory. We then show how this approach can be extended to handle missing data, thus yielding an efficient and general subspace clustering algorithm. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on several challenging motion segmentation and face clustering problems, where the data includes corrupted and missing measurements.

- **Summary**: Previously in 2014, we proposed the Nearest Descent (ND) method, capable of generating an efficient Graph, called the in-tree (IT). Due to some beautiful and effective features, this IT structure proves well suited for data clustering. Although there exist some redundant edges in IT, they usually have salient features and thus it is not hard to remove them.   Subsequently, in order to prevent the seemingly redundant edges from occurring, we proposed the Nearest Neighbor Descent (NND) by adding the "Neighborhood" constraint on ND. Consequently, clusters automatically emerged, without the additional requirement of removing the redundant edges. However, NND proved still not perfect, since it brought in a new yet worse problem, the "over-partitioning" problem.   Now, in this paper, we propose a method, called the Hierarchical Nearest Neighbor Descent (H-NND), which overcomes the over-partitioning problem of NND via using the hierarchical strategy. Specifically, H-NND uses ND to effectively merge the over-segmented sub-graphs or clusters that NND produces. Like ND, H-NND also generates the IT structure, in which the redundant edges once again appear. This seemingly comes back to the situation that ND faces. However, compared with ND, the redundant edges in the IT structure generated by H-NND generally become more salient, thus being much easier and more reliable to be identified even by the simplest edge-removing method which takes the edge length as the only measure. In other words, the IT structure constructed by H-NND becomes more fitted for data clustering. We prove this on several clustering datasets of varying shapes, dimensions and attributes. Besides, compared with ND, H-NND generally takes less computation time to construct the IT data structure for the input data.

- **Summary**: Super-symmetric tensors - a higher-order extension of scatter matrices - are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning and computer vision for modelling data statistics, co-occurrences, or even as visual descriptors. However, the size of these tensors are exponential in the data dimensionality, which is a significant concern. In this paper, we study third-order super-symmetric tensor descriptors in the context of dictionary learning and sparse coding. Our goal is to approximate these tensors as sparse conic combinations of atoms from a learned dictionary, where each atom is a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix. Apart from the significant benefits to tensor compression that this framework provides, our experiments demonstrate that the sparse coefficients produced by the scheme lead to better aggregation of high-dimensional data, and showcases superior performance on two common computer vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art.

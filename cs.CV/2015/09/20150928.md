- **Summary**: A robust algorithm solution is proposed for tracking an object in complex video scenes. In this solution, the bootstrap particle filter (PF) is initialized by an object detector, which models the time-evolving background of the video signal by an adaptive Gaussian mixture. The motion of the object is expressed by a Markov model, which defines the state transition prior. The color and texture features are used to represent the object, and a marginal likelihood based feature fusion approach is proposed. A corresponding object template model updating procedure is developed to account for possible scale changes of the object in the tracking process. Experimental results show that our algorithm beats several existing alternatives in tackling challenging scenarios in video tracking tasks.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching is the key step in estimating depth from two or more images. Recently, some tree-based non-local stereo matching methods have been proposed, which achieved state-of-the-art performance. The algorithms employed some tree structures to aggregate cost and thus improved the performance and reduced the coputation load of the stereo matching. However, the computational complexity of these tree-based algorithms is still high because they search over the entire disparity range. In addition, the extreme greediness of the minimum spanning tree (MST) causes the poor performance in large areas with similar colors but varying disparities. In this paper, we propose an efficient stereo matching method using a hierarchical disparity prediction (HDP) framework to dramatically reduce the disparity search range so as to speed up the tree-based non-local stereo methods. Our disparity prediction scheme works on a graph pyramid derived from an image whose disparity to be estimated. We utilize the disparity of a upper graph to predict a small disparity range for the lower graph. Some independent disparity trees (DT) are generated to form a disparity prediction forest (HDPF) over which the cost aggregation is made. When combined with the state-of-the-art tree-based methods, our scheme not only dramatically speeds up the original methods but also improves their performance by alleviating the second drawback of the tree-based methods. This is partially because our DTs overcome the extreme greediness of the MST. Extensive experimental results on some benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework. For example, the segment-tree based stereo matching becomes about 25.57 times faster and 2.2% more accurate over the Middlebury 2006 full-size dataset.

- **Summary**: Slow feature analysis (SFA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that extracts slowly varying features from a time series. Graph-based SFA (GSFA) is a supervised extension that can solve regression problems if followed by a post-processing regression algorithm. A training graph specifies arbitrary connections between the training samples. The connections in current graphs, however, only depend on the rank of the involved labels. Exploiting the exact label values makes further improvements in estimation accuracy possible.   In this article, we propose the exact label learning (ELL) method to create a graph that codes the desired label explicitly, so that GSFA is able to extract a normalized version of it directly. The ELL method is used for three tasks: (1) We estimate gender from artificial images of human faces (regression) and show the advantage of coding additional labels, particularly skin color. (2) We analyze two existing graphs for regression. (3) We extract compact discriminative features to classify traffic sign images. When the number of output features is limited, a higher classification rate is obtained compared to a graph equivalent to nonlinear Fisher discriminant analysis. The method is versatile, directly supports multiple labels, and provides higher accuracy compared to current graphs for the problems considered.

- **Summary**: The convolutional neural network (ConvNet or CNN) has proven to be very successful in many tasks such as those in computer vision. In this conceptual paper, we study the generative perspective of the discriminative CNN. In particular, we propose to learn the generative FRAME (Filters, Random field, And Maximum Entropy) model using the highly expressive filters pre-learned by the CNN at the convolutional layers. We show that the learning algorithm can generate realistic and rich object and texture patterns in natural scenes. We explain that each learned model corresponds to a new CNN unit at a layer above the layer of filters employed by the model. We further show that it is possible to learn a new layer of CNN units using a generative CNN model, which is a product of experts model, and the learning algorithm admits an EM interpretation with binary latent variables.

- **Summary**: One of the crucial problems in visual tracking is how the object is represented. Conventional appearance-based trackers are using increasingly more complex features in order to be robust. However, complex representations typically not only require more computation for feature extraction, but also make the state inference complicated. We show that with a careful feature selection scheme, extremely simple yet discriminative features can be used for robust object tracking. The central component of the proposed method is a succinct and discriminative representation of the object using discriminative non-orthogonal binary subspace (DNBS) which is spanned by Haar-like features. The DNBS representation inherits the merits of the original NBS in that it efficiently describes the object. It also incorporates the discriminative information to distinguish foreground from background. However, the problem of finding the DNBS bases from an over-complete dictionary is NP-hard. We propose a greedy algorithm called discriminative optimized orthogonal matching pursuit (D-OOMP) to solve this problem. An iterative formulation named iterative D-OOMP is further developed to drastically reduce the redundant computation between iterations and a hierarchical selection strategy is integrated for reducing the search space of features. The proposed DNBS representation is applied to object tracking through SSD-based template matching. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on challenging videos with comparisons against several state-of-the-art trackers and demonstrate its capability to track objects in clutter and moving background.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a novel encoding scheme combining Fisher vector and bag-of-words encodings has been proposed for recognizing action in videos. The proposed Hyper-Fisher vector encoding is sum of local Fisher vectors which are computed based on the traditional Bag-of-Words (BoW) encoding. Thus, the proposed encoding is simple and yet an effective representation over the traditional Fisher Vector encoding. By extensive evaluation on challenging action recognition datasets, viz., Youtube, Olympic Sports, UCF50 and HMDB51, we show that the proposed Hyper-Fisher Vector encoding improves the recognition performance by around 2-3% compared to the improved Fisher Vector encoding. We also perform experiments to show that the performance of the Hyper-Fisher Vector is robust to the dictionary size of the BoW encoding.

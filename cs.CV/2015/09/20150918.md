- **Summary**: Over these years, Correlation Filter-based Trackers (CFTs) have aroused increasing interests in the field of visual object tracking, and have achieved extremely compelling results in different competitions and benchmarks. In this paper, our goal is to review the developments of CFTs with extensive experimental results. 11 trackers are surveyed in our work, based on which a general framework is summarized. Furthermore, we investigate different training schemes for correlation filters, and also discuss various effective improvements that have been made recently. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the surveyed CFTs, and comparisons have been made with other competing trackers. The experimental results have shown that state-of-art performance, in terms of robustness, speed and accuracy, can be achieved by several recent CFTs, such as MUSTer and SAMF. We find that further improvements for correlation filter-based tracking can be made on estimating scales, applying part-based tracking strategy and cooperating with long-term tracking methods.

- **Summary**: Reformulating computer vision problems over Riemannian manifolds has demonstrated superior performance in various computer vision applications. This is because visual data often forms a special structure lying on a lower dimensional space embedded in a higher dimensional space. However, since these manifolds belong to non-Euclidean topological spaces, exploiting their structures is computationally expensive, especially when one considers the clustering analysis of massive amounts of data. To this end, we propose an efficient framework to address the clustering problem on Riemannian manifolds. This framework implements random projections for manifold points via kernel space, which can preserve the geometric structure of the original space, but is computationally efficient. Here, we introduce three methods that follow our framework. We then validate our framework on several computer vision applications by comparing against popular clustering methods on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework maintains the performance of the clustering whilst massively reducing computational complexity by over two orders of magnitude in some cases.

- **Summary**: Multiple color stripes have been employed for structured light-based rapid range imaging to increase the number of uniquely identifiable stripes. The use of multiple color stripes poses two problems: (1) object surface color may disturb the stripe color and (2) the number of adjacent stripes required for identifying a stripe may not be maintained near surface discontinuities such as occluding boundaries. In this paper, we present methods to alleviate those problems. Log-gradient filters are employed to reduce the influence of object colors, and color stripes in two and three directions are used to increase the chance of identifying correct stripes near surface discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a new approach of incorporating kernels into dictionary learning. The kernel K-SVD algorithm (KKSVD), which has been introduced recently, shows an improvement in classification performance, with relation to its linear counterpart K-SVD. However, this algorithm requires the storage and handling of a very large kernel matrix, which leads to high computational cost, while also limiting its use to setups with small number of training examples. We address these problems by combining two ideas: first we approximate the kernel matrix using a cleverly sampled subset of its columns using the Nystr\"{o}m method; secondly, as we wish to avoid using this matrix altogether, we decompose it by SVD to form new "virtual samples," on which any linear dictionary learning can be employed. Our method, termed "Linearized Kernel Dictionary Learning" (LKDL) can be seamlessly applied as a pre-processing stage on top of any efficient off-the-shelf dictionary learning scheme, effectively "kernelizing" it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several tasks of both supervised and unsupervised classification and show the efficiency of the proposed scheme, its easy integration and performance boosting properties.

- **Summary**: Composite convex optimization models arise in several applications, and are especially prevalent in inverse problems with a sparsity inducing norm and in general convex optimization with simple constraints. The most widely used algorithms for convex composite models are accelerated first order methods, however they can take a large number of iterations to compute an acceptable solution for large-scale problems. In this paper we propose to speed up first order methods by taking advantage of the structure present in many applications and in image processing in particular. Our method is based on multi-level optimization methods and exploits the fact that many applications that give rise to large scale models can be modelled using varying degrees of fidelity. We use Nesterov's acceleration techniques together with the multi-level approach to achieve $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ convergence rate, where $\epsilon$ denotes the desired accuracy. The proposed method has a better convergence rate than any other existing multi-level method for convex problems, and in addition has the same rate as accelerated methods, which is known to be optimal for first-order methods. Moreover, as our numerical experiments show, on large-scale face recognition problems our algorithm is several times faster than the state of the art.

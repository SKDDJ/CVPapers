- **Summary**: We introduce a novel method for using reflectance to identify materials. Reflectance offers a unique signature of the material but is challenging to measure and use for recognizing materials due to its high-dimensionality. In this work, one-shot reflectance is captured using a unique optical camera measuring {\it reflectance disks} where the pixel coordinates correspond to surface viewing angles. The reflectance has class-specific stucture and angular gradients computed in this reflectance space reveal the material class.   These reflectance disks encode discriminative information for efficient and accurate material recognition. We introduce a framework called reflectance hashing that models the reflectance disks with dictionary learning and binary hashing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of reflectance hashing for material recognition with a number of real-world materials.

- **Summary**: For more than half a century, the Hough transform is ever-expanding for new frontiers. Thousands of research papers and numerous applications have evolved over the decades. Carrying out an all-inclusive survey is hardly possible and enormously space-demanding. What we care about here is emphasizing some of the most crucial milestones of the transform. We describe its variations elaborating on the basic ones such as the line and circle Hough transforms. The high demand for storage and computation time is clarified with different solution approaches. Since most uses of the transform take place on binary images, we have been concerned with the work done directly on gray or color images. The myriad applications of the standard transform and its variations have been classified highlighting the up-to-date and the unconventional ones. Due to its merits such as noise-immunity and expandability, the transform has an excellent history, and a bright future as well.

- **Summary**: For long time, person re-identification and image search are two separately studied tasks. However, for person re-identification, the effectiveness of local features and the "query-search" mode make it well posed for image search techniques.   In the light of recent advances in image search, this paper proposes to treat person re-identification as an image search problem. Specifically, this paper claims two major contributions. 1) By designing an unsupervised Bag-of-Words representation, we are devoted to bridging the gap between the two tasks by integrating techniques from image search in person re-identification. We show that our system sets up an effective yet efficient baseline that is amenable to further supervised/unsupervised improvements. 2) We contribute a new high quality dataset which uses DPM detector and includes a number of distractor images. Our dataset reaches closer to realistic settings, and new perspectives are provided.   Compared with approaches that rely on feature-feature match, our method is faster by over two orders of magnitude. Moreover, on three datasets, we report competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential medical tool with inherently slow data acquisition process. Slow acquisition process requires patient to be long time exposed to scanning apparatus. In recent years significant efforts are made towards the applying Compressive Sensing technique to the acquisition process of MRI and biomedical images. Compressive Sensing is an emerging theory in signal processing. It aims to reduce the amount of acquired data required for successful signal reconstruction. Reducing the amount of acquired image coefficients leads to lower acquisition time, i.e. time of exposition to the MRI apparatus. Using optimization algorithms, satisfactory image quality can be obtained from the small set of acquired samples. A number of optimization algorithms for the reconstruction of the biomedical images is proposed in the literature. In this paper, three commonly used optimization algorithms are compared and results are presented on the several MRI images.

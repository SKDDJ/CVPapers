- **Summary**: We propose a novel method of efficient upsampling of a single natural image. Current methods for image upsampling tend to produce high-resolution images with either blurry salient edges, or loss of fine textural detail, or spurious noise artifacts.   In our method, we mitigate these effects by modeling the input image as a sum of edge and detail layers, operating upon these layers separately, and merging the upscaled results in an automatic fashion. We formulate the upsampled output image as the solution to a non-convex energy minimization problem, and propose an algorithm to obtain a tractable approximate solution. Our algorithm comprises two main stages. 1) For the edge layer, we use a nonparametric approach by constructing a dictionary of patches from a given image, and synthesize edge regions in a higher-resolution version of the image. 2) For the detail layer, we use a global parametric texture enhancement approach to synthesize detail regions across the image.   We demonstrate that our method is able to accurately reproduce sharp edges as well as synthesize photorealistic textures, while avoiding common artifacts such as ringing and haloing. In addition, our method involves no training phase or estimation of model parameters, and is easily parallelizable. We demonstrate the utility of our method on a number of challenging standard test photos.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel framework for generating lingual descriptions of indoor scenes. Whereas substantial efforts have been made to tackle this problem, previous approaches focusing primarily on generating a single sentence for each image, which is not sufficient for describing complex scenes. We attempt to go beyond this, by generating coherent descriptions with multiple sentences. Our approach is distinguished from conventional ones in several aspects: (1) a 3D visual parsing system that jointly infers objects, attributes, and relations; (2) a generative grammar learned automatically from training text; and (3) a text generation algorithm that takes into account the coherence among sentences. Experiments on the augmented NYU-v2 dataset show that our framework can generate natural descriptions with substantially higher ROGUE scores compared to those produced by the baseline.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks, albeit their great success on feature learning in various computer vision tasks, are usually considered as impractical for online visual tracking because they require very long training time and a large number of training samples. In this work, we present an efficient and very robust tracking algorithm using a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for learning effective feature representations of the target object, in a purely online manner. Our contributions are multifold: First, we introduce a novel truncated structural loss function that maintains as many training samples as possible and reduces the risk of tracking error accumulation. Second, we enhance the ordinary Stochastic Gradient Descent approach in CNN training with a robust sample selection mechanism. The sampling mechanism randomly generates positive and negative samples from different temporal distributions, which are generated by taking the temporal relations and label noise into account. Finally, a lazy yet effective updating scheme is designed for CNN training. Equipped with this novel updating algorithm, the CNN model is robust to some long-existing difficulties in visual tracking such as occlusion or incorrect detections, without loss of the effective adaption for significant appearance changes. In the experiment, our CNN tracker outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods on two recently proposed benchmarks which in total involve over 60 video sequences. The remarkable performance improvement over the existing trackers illustrates the superiority of the feature representations which are learned

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for automatic recognition of human activities for video surveillance applications. We propose to represent an activity by a combination of category components, and demonstrate that this approach offers flexibility to add new activities to the system and an ability to deal with the problem of building models for activities lacking training data. For improving the recognition accuracy, a Confident-Frame- based Recognition algorithm is also proposed, where the video frames with high confidence for recognizing an activity are used as a specialized local model to help classify the remainder of the video frames. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for automatic recognition of group activities for video surveillance applications. We propose to use a group representative to handle the recognition with a varying number of group members, and use an Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) to model the relationship between people. Furthermore, we propose a group activity detection algorithm which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric group activities, and demonstrate that this approach enables the detection of hierarchical interactions between people. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: In this paper, a macroblock classification method is proposed for various video processing applications involving motions. Based on the analysis of the Motion Vector field in the compressed video, we propose to classify Macroblocks of each video frame into different classes and use this class information to describe the frame content. We demonstrate that this low-computation-complexity method can efficiently catch the characteristics of the frame. Based on the proposed macroblock classification, we further propose algorithms for different video processing applications, including shot change detection, motion discontinuity detection, and outlier rejection for global motion estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the methods based on the proposed approach can work effectively on these applications.

- **Summary**: Image deblurring techniques play important roles in many image processing applications. As the blur varies spatially across the image plane, it calls for robust and effective methods to deal with the spatially-variant blur problem. In this paper, a Saliency-based Deblurring (SD) approach is proposed based on the saliency detection for salient-region segmentation and a corresponding compensate method for image deblurring. We also propose a PDE-based deblurring method which introduces an anisotropic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model for latent image prediction and employs an adaptive optimization model in the kernel estimation and deconvolution steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

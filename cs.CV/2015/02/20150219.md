- **Summary**: We introduce algorithms to visualize feature spaces used by object detectors. Our method works by inverting a visual feature back to multiple natural images. We found that these visualizations allow us to analyze object detection systems in new ways and gain new insight into the detector's failures. For example, when we visualize the features for high scoring false alarms, we discovered that, although they are clearly wrong in image space, they do look deceptively similar to true positives in feature space. This result suggests that many of these false alarms are caused by our choice of feature space, and supports that creating a better learning algorithm or building bigger datasets is unlikely to correct these errors. By visualizing feature spaces, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of recognition systems.

- **Summary**: In this paper two knowledge representation models are proposed, FP4 and FP6. Both combine ideas from fuzzy sets and four-valued and hexa-valued logics. Both represent imprecise properties whose accomplished degree is unknown or contradictory for some objects. A possible application in the color analysis and color image processing is discussed.

- **Summary**: People preserve memories of events such as birthdays, weddings, or vacations by capturing photos, often depicting groups of people. Invariably, some individuals in the image are more important than others given the context of the event. This paper analyzes the concept of the importance of individuals in group photographs. We address two specific questions -- Given an image, who are the most important individuals in it? Given multiple images of a person, which image depicts the person in the most important role? We introduce a measure of importance of people in images and investigate the correlation between importance and visual saliency. We find that not only can we automatically predict the importance of people from purely visual cues, incorporating this predicted importance results in significant improvement in applications such as im2text (generating sentences that describe images of groups of people).

- **Summary**: Over the years, computer vision researchers have spent an immense amount of effort on designing image features for the visual object recognition task. We propose to incorporate this valuable experience to guide the task of training deep neural networks. Our idea is to pretrain the network through the task of replicating the process of hand-designed feature extraction. By learning to replicate the process, the neural network integrates previous research knowledge and learns to model visual objects in a way similar to the hand-designed features. In the succeeding finetuning step, it further learns object-specific representations from labeled data and this boosts its classification power. We pretrain two convolutional neural networks where one replicates the process of histogram of oriented gradients feature extraction, and the other replicates the process of region covariance feature extraction. After finetuning, we achieve substantially better performance than the baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an emerging technique in the field of biomedical imaging, with applications in ophthalmology, dermatology, coronary imaging etc. OCT images usually suffer from a granular pattern, called speckle noise, which restricts the process of interpretation. Therefore the need for speckle noise reduction techniques is of high importance. To the best of our knowledge, use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) techniques has never been explored for speckle reduction of OCT images. Here, a comparative study of several ICA techniques (InfoMax, JADE, FastICA and SOBI) is provided for noise reduction of retinal OCT images. Having multiple B-scans of the same location, the eye movements are compensated using a rigid registration technique. Then, different ICA techniques are applied to the aggregated set of B-scans for extracting the noise-free image. Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), Contrast-to-Noise-Ratio (CNR) and Equivalent-Number-of-Looks (ENL), as well as analysis on the computational complexity of the methods, are considered as metrics for comparison. The results show that use of ICA can be beneficial, especially in case of having fewer number of B-scans.

- **Summary**: As one of the most important types of (weaker) supervised information in machine learning and pattern recognition, pairwise constraint, which specifies whether a pair of data points occur together, has recently received significant attention, especially the problem of pairwise constraint propagation. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is that compared to the data label, pairwise constraints are more general and easily to collect, and the second is that since the available pairwise constraints are usually limited, the constraint propagation problem is thus important.   This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of pairwise constraint propagation research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of pairwise constraint propagation. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing propagation techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category.

- **Summary**: The inability of automated edge detection methods inspired from primal sketch models to accurately calculate object edges under the influence of pixel noise is an open problem. Extending the principles of image perception i.e. Weber-Fechner law, and Sheperd similarity law, we propose a new edge detection method and formulation that use perceived brightness and neighbourhood similarity calculations in the determination of robust object edges. The robustness of the detected edges is benchmark against Sobel, SIS, Kirsch, and Prewitt edge detection methods in an example face recognition problem showing statistically significant improvement in recognition accuracy and pixel noise tolerance.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits object segmentation in order to improve the accuracy of object detection. We frame the problem as inference in a Markov Random Field, in which each detection hypothesis scores object appearance as well as contextual information using Convolutional Neural Networks, and allows the hypothesis to choose and score a segment out of a large pool of accurate object segmentation proposals. This enables the detector to incorporate additional evidence when it is available and thus results in more accurate detections. Our experiments show an improvement of 4.1% in mAP over the R-CNN baseline on PASCAL VOC 2010, and 3.4% over the current state-of-the-art, demonstrating the power of our approach.

- **Summary**: The capacity to recognize faces under varied poses is a fundamental human ability that presents a unique challenge for computer vision systems. Compared to frontal face recognition, which has been intensively studied and has gradually matured in the past few decades, pose-invariant face recognition (PIFR) remains a largely unsolved problem. However, PIFR is crucial to realizing the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications, since face recognition is intrinsically a passive biometric technology for recognizing uncooperative subjects. In this paper, we discuss the inherent difficulties in PIFR and present a comprehensive review of established techniques. Existing PIFR methods can be grouped into four categories, i.e., pose-robust feature extraction approaches, multi-view subspace learning approaches, face synthesis approaches, and hybrid approaches. The motivations, strategies, pros/cons, and performance of representative approaches are described and compared. Moreover, promising directions for future research are discussed.

- **Summary**: Previous work on predicting the target of visual search from human fixations only considered closed-world settings in which training labels are available and predictions are performed for a known set of potential targets. In this work we go beyond the state of the art by studying search target prediction in an open-world setting in which we no longer assume that we have fixation data to train for the search targets. We present a dataset containing fixation data of 18 users searching for natural images from three image categories within synthesised image collages of about 80 images. In a closed-world baseline experiment we show that we can predict the correct target image out of a candidate set of five images. We then present a new problem formulation for search target prediction in the open-world setting that is based on learning compatibilities between fixations and potential targets.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction of a 3D object or a scene is a classical inverse problem in Computer Vision. In the case of a single image this is called the Shape-from-Shading (SfS) problem and it is known to be ill-posed even in a simplified version like the vertical light source case. A huge number of works deals with the orthographic SfS problem based on the Lambertian reflectance model, the most common and simplest model which leads to an eikonal type equation when the light source is on the vertical axis. In this paper we want to study non-Lambertian models since they are more realistic and suitable whenever one has to deal with different kind of surfaces, rough or specular. We will present a unified mathematical formulation of some popular orthographic non-Lambertian models, considering vertical and oblique light directions as well as different viewer positions. These models lead to more complex stationary nonlinear partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi type which can be regarded as the generalization of the classical eikonal equation corresponding to the Lambertian case. However, all the equations corresponding to the models considered here (Oren-Nayar and Phong) have a similar structure so we can look for weak solutions to this class in the viscosity solution framework. Via this unified approach, we are able to develop a semi-Lagrangian approximation scheme for the Oren-Nayar and the Phong model and to prove a general convergence result. Numerical simulations on synthetic and real images will illustrate the effectiveness of this approach and the main features of the scheme, also comparing the results with previous results in the literature.

- **Summary**: The annotation of image and video data of large datasets is a fundamental task in multimedia information retrieval and computer vision applications. In order to support the users during the image and video annotation process, several software tools have been developed to provide them with a graphical environment which helps drawing object contours, handling tracking information and specifying object metadata. Here we introduce a preliminary version of the image annotation tools developed at the Imaging and Vision Laboratory.

- **Summary**: Learning a hashing function for cross-media search is very desirable due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. However, the data crawled from Internet cannot always guarantee good correspondence among different modalities which affects the learning for hashing function. In this paper, we focus on cross-modal hashing with partially corresponded data. The data without full correspondence are made in use to enhance the hashing performance. The experiments on Wiki and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art hashing approaches with fewer correspondence information.



### NEFI: Network Extraction From Images

- **Summary**: Networks and network-like structures are amongst the central building blocks of many technological and biological systems. Given a mathematical graph representation of a network, methods from graph theory enable a precise investigation of its properties. Software for the analysis of graphs is widely available and has been applied to graphs describing large scale networks such as social networks, protein-interaction networks, etc. In these applications, graph acquisition, i.e., the extraction of a mathematical graph from a network, is relatively simple. However, for many network-like structures, e.g. leaf venations, slime molds and mud cracks, data collection relies on images where graph extraction requires domain-specific solutions or even manual. Here we introduce Network Extraction From Images, NEFI, a software tool that automatically extracts accurate graphs from images of a wide range of networks originating in various domains. While there is previous work on graph extraction from images, theoretical results are fully accessible only to an expert audience and ready-to-use implementations for non-experts are rarely available or insufficiently documented. NEFI provides a novel platform allowing practitioners from many disciplines to easily extract graph representations from images by supplying flexible tools from image processing, computer vision and graph theory bundled in a convenient package. Thus, NEFI constitutes a scalable alternative to tedious and error-prone manual graph extraction and special purpose tools. We anticipate NEFI to enable the collection of larger datasets by reducing the time spent on graph extraction. The analysis of these new datasets may open up the possibility to gain new insights into the structure and function of various types of networks. NEFI is open source and available http://nefi.mpi-inf.mpg.de.

- **Summary**: A new segmentation fusion method is proposed that ensembles the output of several segmentation algorithms applied on a remotely sensed image. The candidate segmentation sets are processed to achieve a consensus segmentation using a stochastic optimization algorithm based on the Filtered Stochastic BOEM (Best One Element Move) method. For this purpose, Filtered Stochastic BOEM is reformulated as a segmentation fusion problem by designing a new distance learning approach. The proposed algorithm also embeds the computation of the optimum number of clusters into the segmentation fusion problem.

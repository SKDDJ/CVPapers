- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a novel approach to multi-action recognition that performs joint segmentation and classification. This approach models each action using a Gaussian mixture using robust low-dimensional action features. Segmentation is achieved by performing classification on overlapping temporal windows, which are then merged to produce the final result. This approach is considerably less complicated than previous methods which use dynamic programming or computationally expensive hidden Markov models (HMMs). Initial experiments on a stitched version of the KTH dataset show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 78.3%, outperforming a recent HMM-based approach which obtained 71.2%.

- **Summary**: Automated scene analysis has been a topic of great interest in computer vision and cognitive science. Recently, with the growth of crowd phenomena in the real world, crowded scene analysis has attracted much attention. However, the visual occlusions and ambiguities in crowded scenes, as well as the complex behaviors and scene semantics, make the analysis a challenging task. In the past few years, an increasing number of works on crowded scene analysis have been reported, covering different aspects including crowd motion pattern learning, crowd behavior and activity analysis, and anomaly detection in crowds. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art techniques on this topic. We first provide the background knowledge and the available features related to crowded scenes. Then, existing models, popular algorithms, evaluation protocols, as well as system performance are provided corresponding to different aspects of crowded scene analysis. We also outline the available datasets for performance evaluation. Finally, some research problems and promising future directions are presented with discussions.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present an unsupervised method to learn the weights with which the scores of multiple classifiers must be combined in classifier fusion settings. We also introduce a novel metric for ranking instances based on an index which depends upon the rank of weighted scores of test points among the weighted scores of training points. We show that the optimized index can be used for computing measures such as average precision. Unlike most classifier fusion methods where a single weight is learned to weigh all examples our method learns instance-specific weights. The problem is formulated as learning the weight which maximizes a clarity index; subsequently the index itself and the learned weights both are used separately to rank all the test points. Our method gives an unsupervised method of optimizing performance on actual test data, unlike the well known stacking-based methods where optimization is done over a labeled training set. Moreover, we show that our method is tolerant to noisy classifiers and can be used for selecting N-best classifiers.

- **Summary**: We present a hierarchical maximum-margin clustering method for unsupervised data analysis. Our method extends beyond flat maximum-margin clustering, and performs clustering recursively in a top-down manner. We propose an effective greedy splitting criteria for selecting which cluster to split next, and employ regularizers that enforce feature sharing/competition for capturing data semantics. Experimental results obtained on four standard datasets show that our method outperforms flat and hierarchical clustering baselines, while forming clean and semantically meaningful cluster hierarchies.

- **Summary**: Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66%). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1%, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.

- **Summary**: A recently designed hyperspectral imaging device enables multiplexed acquisition of an entire data volume in a single snapshot thanks to monolithically-integrated spectral filters. Such an agile imaging technique comes at the cost of a reduced spatial resolution and the need for a demosaicing procedure on its interleaved data. In this work, we address both issues and propose an approach inspired by recent developments in compressed sensing and analysis sparse models. We formulate our superresolution and demosaicing task as a 3-D generalized inpainting problem. Interestingly, the target spatial resolution can be adjusted for mitigating the compression level of our sensing. The reconstruction procedure uses a fast greedy method called Pseudo-inverse IHT. We also show on simulations that a random arrangement of the spectral filters on the sensor is preferable to regular mosaic layout as it improves the quality of the reconstruction. The efficiency of our technique is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data as acquired by the snapshot imager.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel approach for deciding on the appropriateness or not of an acquired fingerprint image into a given database. The process begins with the assembly of a training base in an image space constructed by combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and edge detection. Then, the parameter H, a new feature that helps in the decision making about the relevance of a fingerprint image in databases, is derived from a relationship between Euclidean and Mahalanobian distances. This procedure ends with the lifting of the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), where the thresholds defined on the parameter H are chosen according to the acceptable rates of false positives and false negatives.



### Visual Recognition by Counting Instances: A Multi-Instance Cardinality Potential Kernel

- **Summary**: Many visual recognition problems can be approached by counting instances. To determine whether an event is present in a long internet video, one could count how many frames seem to contain the activity. Classifying the activity of a group of people can be done by counting the actions of individual people. Encoding these cardinality relationships can reduce sensitivity to clutter, in the form of irrelevant frames or individuals not involved in a group activity. Learned parameters can encode how many instances tend to occur in a class of interest. To this end, this paper develops a powerful and flexible framework to infer any cardinality relation between latent labels in a multi-instance model. Hard or soft cardinality relations can be encoded to tackle diverse levels of ambiguity. Experiments on tasks such as human activity recognition, video event detection, and video summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of using cardinality relations for improving recognition results.

- **Summary**: We present a novel approach to the regression of quantum mechanical energies based on a scattering transform of an intermediate electron density representation. A scattering transform is a deep convolution network computed with a cascade of multiscale wavelet transforms. It possesses appropriate invariant and stability properties for quantum energy regression. This new framework removes fundamental limitations of Coulomb matrix based energy regressions, and numerical experiments give state-of-the-art accuracy over planar molecules.

- **Summary**: The text detection and localization plays a major role in video analysis and understanding. The scene text embedded in video consist of high-level semantics and hence contributes significantly to visual content analysis and retrieval. This paper proposes a novel method to robustly localize the texts in natural scene images and videos based on sobel edge emphasizing approach. The input image is preprocessed and edge emphasis is done to detect the text clusters. Further, a set of rules have been devised using morphological operators for false positive elimination and connected component analysis is performed to detect the text regions and hence text localization is performed. The experimental results obtained on publicly available standard datasets illustrate that the proposed method can detect and localize the texts of various sizes, fonts and colors.

- **Summary**: In this paper we propose a generic recursive algorithm for improving image denoising methods. Given the initial denoised image, we suggest repeating the following "SOS" procedure: (i) (S)trengthen the signal by adding the previous denoised image to the degraded input image, (ii) (O)perate the denoising method on the strengthened image, and (iii) (S)ubtract the previous denoised image from the restored signal-strengthened outcome. The convergence of this process is studied for the K-SVD image denoising and related algorithms. Still in the context of K-SVD image denoising, we introduce an interesting interpretation of the SOS algorithm as a technique for closing the gap between the local patch-modeling and the global restoration task, thereby leading to improved performance. In a quest for the theoretical origin of the SOS algorithm, we provide a graph-based interpretation of our method, where the SOS recursive update effectively minimizes a penalty function that aims to denoise the image, while being regularized by the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the SOS boosting algorithm for several leading denoising methods (K-SVD, NLM, BM3D, and EPLL), showing tendency to further improve denoising performance.

- **Summary**: Abnormality detection in video poses particular challenges due to the infinite size of the class of all irregular objects and behaviors. Thus no (or by far not enough) abnormal training samples are available and we need to find abnormalities in test data without actually knowing what they are. Nevertheless, the prevailing concept of the field is to directly search for individual abnormal local patches or image regions independent of another. To address this problem, we propose a method for joint detection of abnormalities in videos by spatio-temporal video parsing. The goal of video parsing is to find a set of indispensable normal spatio-temporal object hypotheses that jointly explain all the foreground of a video, while, at the same time, being supported by normal training samples. Consequently, we avoid a direct detection of abnormalities and discover them indirectly as those hypotheses which are needed for covering the foreground without finding an explanation for themselves by normal samples. Abnormalities are localized by MAP inference in a graphical model and we solve it efficiently by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. We experimentally evaluate our approach on several challenging benchmark sets, improving over the state-of-the-art on all standard benchmarks both in terms of abnormality classification and localization.

- **Summary**: The topology of digital images has been studied much in recent years, but no attempt has been made to exhaustively catalog the structure of binary images of small numbers of points. We produce enumerations of several classes of digital images up to isomorphism and decide which among them are homotopy equivalent to one another. Noting some patterns in the results, we make some conjectures about digital images which are irreducible but not rigid.

- **Summary**: A blind compressive sensing algorithm is proposed to reconstruct hyperspectral images from spectrally-compressed measurements.The wavelength-dependent data are coded and then superposed, mapping the three-dimensional hyperspectral datacube to a two-dimensional image. The inversion algorithm learns a dictionary {\em in situ} from the measurements via global-local shrinkage priors. By using RGB images as side information of the compressive sensing system, the proposed approach is extended to learn a coupled dictionary from the joint dataset of the compressed measurements and the corresponding RGB images, to improve reconstruction quality. A prototype camera is built using a liquid-crystal-on-silicon modulator. Experimental reconstructions of hyperspectral datacubes from both simulated and real compressed measurements demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed inversion algorithm, the feasibility of the camera and the benefit of side information.

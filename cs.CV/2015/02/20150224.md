- **Summary**: The text detection and localization is important for video analysis and understanding. The scene text in video contains semantic information and thus can contribute significantly to video retrieval and understanding. However, most of the approaches detect scene text in still images or single video frame. Videos differ from images in temporal redundancy. This paper proposes a novel hybrid method to robustly localize the texts in natural scene images and videos based on fusion of discrete wavelet transform and gradient difference. A set of rules and geometric properties have been devised to localize the actual text regions. Then, morphological operation is performed to generate the text regions and finally the connected component analysis is employed to localize the text in a video frame. The experimental results obtained on publicly available standard ICDAR 2003 and Hua dataset illustrate that the proposed method can accurately detect and localize texts of various sizes, fonts and colors. The experimentation on huge collection of video databases reveal the suitability of the proposed method to video databases.

- **Summary**: We propose an online visual tracking algorithm by learning discriminative saliency map using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Given a CNN pre-trained on a large-scale image repository in offline, our algorithm takes outputs from hidden layers of the network as feature descriptors since they show excellent representation performance in various general visual recognition problems. The features are used to learn discriminative target appearance models using an online Support Vector Machine (SVM). In addition, we construct target-specific saliency map by backpropagating CNN features with guidance of the SVM, and obtain the final tracking result in each frame based on the appearance model generatively constructed with the saliency map. Since the saliency map visualizes spatial configuration of target effectively, it improves target localization accuracy and enable us to achieve pixel-level target segmentation. We verify the effectiveness of our tracking algorithm through extensive experiment on a challenging benchmark, where our method illustrates outstanding performance compared to the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we define a distance for the HSL colour system. Next, the proposed distance is used for a fuzzy colour clustering algorithm construction. The presented algorithm is related to the well-known fuzzy c-means algorithm. Finally, the clustering algorithm is used as colour reduction method. The obtained experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: We introduce and evaluate several architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks to predict the 3D joint locations of a hand given a depth map. We first show that a prior on the 3D pose can be easily introduced and significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. We also show how to use context efficiently to deal with ambiguities between fingers. These two contributions allow us to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on several challenging benchmarks, both in terms of accuracy and computation times.

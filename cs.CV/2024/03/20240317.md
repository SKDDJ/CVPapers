- **Summary**: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making across various domains, but it presents significant challenges. Recent studies have explored image-driven approaches using computer vision models to address these challenges, often employing lineplots as the visual representation of time series data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses time-frequency spectrograms as the visual representation of time series data. We introduce the use of a vision transformer for multimodal learning, showcasing the advantages of our approach across diverse datasets from different domains. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare our method against statistical baselines (EMA and ARIMA), a state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach (DeepAR), other visual representations of time series data (lineplot images), and an ablation study on using only the time series as input. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of utilizing spectrograms as a visual representation for time series data, along with the advantages of employing a vision transformer for simultaneous learning in both the time and frequency domains.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate high-quality images from textual prompts. However, increasing research indicates that these models memorize and replicate images from their training data, raising tremendous concerns about potential copyright infringement and privacy risks. In our study, we provide a novel perspective to understand this memorization phenomenon by examining its relationship with cross-attention mechanisms. We reveal that during memorization, the cross-attention tends to focus disproportionately on the embeddings of specific tokens. The diffusion model is overfitted to these token embeddings, memorizing corresponding training images. To elucidate this phenomenon, we further identify and discuss various intrinsic findings of cross-attention that contribute to memorization. Building on these insights, we introduce an innovative approach to detect and mitigate memorization in diffusion models. The advantage of our proposed method is that it will not compromise the speed of either the training or the inference processes in these models while preserving the quality of generated images.

- **Summary**: Personalized text-to-image (T2I) models not only produce lifelike and varied visuals but also allow users to tailor the images to fit their personal taste. These personalization techniques can grasp the essence of a concept through a collection of images, or adjust a pre-trained text-to-image model with a specific image input for subject-driven or attribute-aware guidance. Yet, accurately capturing the distinct visual attributes of an individual image poses a challenge for these methods. To address this issue, we introduce OSTAF, a novel parameter-efficient one-shot fine-tuning method which only utilizes one reference image for T2I personalization. A novel hypernetwork-powered attribute-focused fine-tuning mechanism is employed to achieve the precise learning of various attribute features (e.g., appearance, shape or drawing style) from the reference image. Comparing to existing image customization methods, our method shows significant superiority in attribute identification and application, as well as achieves a good balance between efficiency and output quality.

- **Summary**: The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gained its popularity recently by combining the advantages of both primitive-based and volumetric 3D representations, resulting in improved quality and efficiency for 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS is not alias-free, and its rendering at varying resolutions could produce severe blurring or jaggies. This is because 3DGS treats each pixel as an isolated, single point rather than as an area, causing insensitivity to changes in the footprints of pixels. Consequently, this discrete sampling scheme inevitably results in aliasing, owing to the restricted sampling bandwidth. In this paper, we derive an analytical solution to address this issue. More specifically, we use a conditioned logistic function as the analytic approximation of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in a one-dimensional Gaussian signal and calculate the Gaussian integral by subtracting the CDFs. We then introduce this approximation in the two-dimensional pixel shading, and present Analytic-Splatting, which analytically approximates the Gaussian integral within the 2D-pixel window area to better capture the intensity response of each pixel. Moreover, we use the approximated response of the pixel window integral area to participate in the transmittance calculation of volume rendering, making Analytic-Splatting sensitive to the changes in pixel footprint at different resolutions. Experiments on various datasets validate that our approach has better anti-aliasing capability that gives more details and better fidelity.

- **Summary**: Motion prediction is among the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods of motion forecasting primarily encode vector information of maps and historical trajectory data of traffic participants, lacking a comprehensive understanding of overall traffic semantics, which in turn affects the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the global traffic context understanding for motion prediction tasks. We first conducted systematic prompt engineering, visualizing complex traffic environments and historical trajectory information of traffic participants into image prompts -- Transportation Context Map (TC-Map), accompanied by corresponding text prompts. Through this approach, we obtained rich traffic context information from the LLM. By integrating this information into the motion prediction model, we demonstrate that such context can enhance the accuracy of motion predictions. Furthermore, considering the cost associated with LLMs, we propose a cost-effective deployment strategy: enhancing the accuracy of motion prediction tasks at scale with 0.7\% LLM-augmented datasets. Our research offers valuable insights into enhancing the understanding of traffic scenes of LLMs and the motion prediction performance of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: Crashes and delays at Railroad Highway Grade Crossings (RHGC), where highways and railroads intersect, pose significant safety concerns for the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Despite the critical importance of addressing accidents and traffic delays at highway-railroad intersections, there is a notable dearth of research on practical solutions for managing these issues. In response to this gap in the literature, our study introduces an intelligent system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to enhance safety at Railroad Highway Grade crossings (RHGC). This research proposed a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)- based ensemble model that integrates a variety of YOLO variants, specifically YOLOv5S, YOLOv5M, and YOLOv5L, for grade-crossing object detection, utilizes segmentation techniques from the UNet architecture for detecting approaching rail at a grade crossing. Both methods are implemented on a Raspberry Pi. Moreover, the strategy employs high-definition cameras installed at the RHGC. This framework enables the system to monitor objects within the Region of Interest (ROI) at crossings, detect the approach of trains, and clear the crossing area before a train arrives. Regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and Intersection over Union (IoU), the proposed state-of-the-art NMS-based object detection ensemble model achieved 96% precision. In addition, the UNet segmentation model obtained a 98% IoU value. This automated railroad grade crossing system powered by artificial intelligence represents a promising solution for enhancing safety at highway-railroad intersections.



### Controllable Relation Disentanglement for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose to tackle Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) from a new perspective, i.e., relation disentanglement, which means enhancing FSCIL via disentangling spurious relation between categories. The challenge of disentangling spurious correlations lies in the poor controllability of FSCIL. On one hand, an FSCIL model is required to be trained in an incremental manner and thus it is very hard to directly control relationships between categories of different sessions. On the other hand, training samples per novel category are only in the few-shot setting, which increases the difficulty of alleviating spurious relation issues as well. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new simple-yet-effective method, called ConTrollable Relation-disentangLed Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (CTRL-FSCIL). Specifically, during the base session, we propose to anchor base category embeddings in feature space and construct disentanglement proxies to bridge gaps between the learning for category representations in different sessions, thereby making category relation controllable. During incremental learning, the parameters of the backbone network are frozen in order to relieve the negative impact of data scarcity. Moreover, a disentanglement loss is designed to effectively guide a relation disentanglement controller to disentangle spurious correlations between the embeddings encoded by the backbone. In this way, the spurious correlation issue in FSCIL can be suppressed. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, mini-ImageNet, and CUB-200 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CTRL-FSCIL method.

- **Summary**: Automatic karyotype analysis is often defined as a visual perception task focused solely on chromosomal object-level modeling. This definition has led most existing methods to overlook componential and holistic information, significantly constraining model performance. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in current technologies hinders clinical adoption. In this paper, we introduce Tokensome, a novel vision-language model based on chromosome tokenization for explainable and cognitive karyotyping. Tokensome elevates the method from the conventional visual perception layer to the cognitive decision-making layer. This elevation enables the integration of domain knowledge and cognitive reasoning via knowledge graphs and LLMs, markedly enhancing model's explainability and facilitating abnormality detection.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment the sounding objects in video frames. Although great progress has been witnessed, we experimentally reveal that current methods reach marginal performance gain within the use of the unlabeled frames, leading to the underutilization issue. To fully explore the potential of the unlabeled frames for AVS, we explicitly divide them into two categories based on their temporal characteristics, i.e., neighboring frame (NF) and distant frame (DF). NFs, temporally adjacent to the labeled frame, often contain rich motion information that assists in the accurate localization of sounding objects. Contrary to NFs, DFs have long temporal distances from the labeled frame, which share semantic-similar objects with appearance variations. Considering their unique characteristics, we propose a versatile framework that effectively leverages them to tackle AVS. Specifically, for NFs, we exploit the motion cues as the dynamic guidance to improve the objectness localization. Besides, we exploit the semantic cues in DFs by treating them as valid augmentations to the labeled frames, which are then used to enrich data diversity in a self-training manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the versatility and superiority of our method, unleashing the power of the abundant unlabeled frames.

- **Summary**: Beyond the superiority of the text-to-image diffusion model in generating high-quality images, recent studies have attempted to uncover its potential for adapting the learned semantic knowledge to visual perception tasks. In this work, instead of translating a generative diffusion model into a visual perception model, we explore to retain the generative ability with the perceptive adaptation. To accomplish this, we present Zippo, a unified framework for zipping the color and transparency distributions into a single diffusion model by expanding the diffusion latent into a joint representation of RGB images and alpha mattes. By alternatively selecting one modality as the condition and then applying the diffusion process to the counterpart modality, Zippo is capable of generating RGB images from alpha mattes and predicting transparency from input images. In addition to single-modality prediction, we propose a modality-aware noise reassignment strategy to further empower Zippo with jointly generating RGB images and its corresponding alpha mattes under the text guidance. Our experiments showcase Zippo's ability of efficient text-conditioned transparent image generation and present plausible results of Matte-to-RGB and RGB-to-Matte translation.



### Adaptive Semantic-Enhanced Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution

- **Summary**: Remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) is a crucial task to restore high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) observations. Recently, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has shown promising performance in image reconstructions by overcoming problems inherent in generative models, such as over-smoothing and mode collapse. However, the high-frequency details generated by DDPM often suffer from misalignment with HR images due to the model's tendency to overlook long-range semantic contexts. This is attributed to the widely used U-Net decoder in the conditional noise predictor, which tends to overemphasize local information, leading to the generation of noises with significant variances during the prediction process. To address these issues, an adaptive semantic-enhanced DDPM (ASDDPM) is proposed to enhance the detail-preserving capability of the DDPM by incorporating low-frequency semantic information provided by the Transformer. Specifically, a novel adaptive diffusion Transformer decoder (ADTD) is developed to bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder through regulating the noise prediction with the global contextual relationships and long-range dependencies in the diffusion process. Additionally, a residual feature fusion strategy establishes information exchange between the two decoders at multiple levels. As a result, the predicted noise generated by our approach closely approximates that of the real noise distribution.Extensive experiments on two SR and two semantic segmentation datasets confirm the superior performance of the proposed ASDDPM in both SR and the subsequent downstream applications. The source code will be available at https://github.com/littlebeen/ASDDPM-Adaptive-Semantic-Enhanced-DDPM.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection is vital in various industrial scenarios, including the identification of unusual patterns in production lines and the detection of manufacturing defects for quality control. Existing techniques tend to be specialized in individual scenarios and lack generalization capacities. In this study, we aim to develop a generic anomaly detection model applicable across multiple scenarios. To achieve this, we customize generic visual-language foundation models that possess extensive knowledge and robust reasoning abilities into anomaly detectors and reasoners. Specifically, we introduce a multi-modal prompting strategy that incorporates domain knowledge from experts as conditions to guide the models. Our approach considers multi-modal prompt types, including task descriptions, class context, normality rules, and reference images. In addition, we unify the input representation of multi-modality into a 2D image format, enabling multi-modal anomaly detection and reasoning. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that combining visual and language prompts as conditions for customizing the models enhances anomaly detection performance. The customized models showcase the ability to detect anomalies across different data modalities such as images and point clouds. Qualitative case studies further highlight the anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities, particularly for multi-object scenes and temporal data.

- **Summary**: Real-world multi-modal problems are rarely solved by a single machine learning model, and often require multi-step computational plans that involve stitching several models. Tool-augmented LLMs hold tremendous promise for automating the generation of such computational plans. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs as planners for multi-step multi-modal tasks has prevented a systematic study of planner design decisions. Should LLMs generate a full plan in a single shot or step-by-step? Should they invoke tools directly with Python code or through structured data formats like JSON? Does feedback improve planning? To answer these questions and more, we introduce m&m's: a benchmark containing 4K+ multi-step multi-modal tasks involving 33 tools that include multi-modal models, (free) public APIs, and image processing modules. For each of these task queries, we provide automatically generated plans using this realistic toolset. We further provide a high-quality subset of 1,565 task plans that are human-verified and correctly executable. With m&m's, we evaluate 6 popular LLMs with 2 planning strategies (multi-step vs. step-by-step planning), 2 plan formats (JSON vs. code), and 3 types of feedback (parsing/verification/execution). Finally, we summarize takeaways from our extensive experiments. Our dataset and code are available on HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/zixianma/mnms) and Github (https://github.com/RAIVNLab/mnms).

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on few-shot Sound Event Detection (SED), which aims to automatically recognize and classify sound events with limited samples. However, prevailing methods methods in few-shot SED predominantly rely on segment-level predictions, which often providing detailed, fine-grained predictions, particularly for events of brief duration. Although frame-level prediction strategies have been proposed to overcome these limitations, these strategies commonly face difficulties with prediction truncation caused by background noise. To alleviate this issue, we introduces an innovative multitask frame-level SED framework. In addition, we introduce TimeFilterAug, a linear timing mask for data augmentation, to increase the model's robustness and adaptability to diverse acoustic environments. The proposed method achieves a F-score of 63.8%, securing the 1st rank in the few-shot bioacoustic event detection category of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events Challenge 2023.

- **Summary**: Benchmarks of the multilingual capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) models compare generated images prompted in a test language to an expected image distribution over a concept set. One such benchmark, "Conceptual Coverage Across Languages" (CoCo-CroLa), assesses the tangible noun inventory of T2I models by prompting them to generate pictures from a concept list translated to seven languages and comparing the output image populations. Unfortunately, we find that this benchmark contains translation errors of varying severity in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. We provide corrections for these errors and analyze how impactful they are on the utility and validity of CoCo-CroLa as a benchmark. We reassess multiple baseline T2I models with the revisions, compare the outputs elicited under the new translations to those conditioned on the old, and show that a correction's impactfulness on the image-domain benchmark results can be predicted in the text domain with similarity scores. Our findings will guide the future development of T2I multilinguality metrics by providing analytical tools for practical translation decisions.

- **Summary**: Expansion property of a graph refers to its strong connectivity as well as sparseness. It has been reported that deep neural networks can be pruned to a high degree of sparsity while maintaining their performance. Such pruning is essential for performing real time sequence learning tasks using recurrent neural networks in resource constrained platforms. We prune recurrent networks such as RNNs and LSTMs, maintaining a large spectral gap of the underlying graphs and ensuring their layerwise expansion properties. We also study the time unfolded recurrent network graphs in terms of the properties of their bipartite layers. Experimental results for the benchmark sequence MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Google speech command data show that expander graph properties are key to preserving classification accuracy of RNN and LSTM.

- **Summary**: Face morphing attacks circumvent face recognition systems (FRSs) by creating a morphed image that contains multiple identities. However, existing face morphing attack methods either sacrifice image quality or compromise the identity preservation capability. Consequently, these attacks fail to bypass FRSs verification well while still managing to deceive human observers. These methods typically rely on global information from contributing images, ignoring the detailed information from effective facial regions. To address the above issues, we propose a novel morphing attack method to improve the quality of morphed images and better preserve the contributing identities. Our proposed method leverages the hierarchical generative network to capture both local detailed and global consistency information. Additionally, a mask-guided image blending module is dedicated to removing artifacts from areas outside the face to improve the image's visual quality. The proposed attack method is compared to state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets in terms of FRSs' vulnerability, attack detectability, and image quality. The results show our method's potential threat of deceiving FRSs while being capable of passing multiple morphing attack detection (MAD) scenarios.

- **Summary**: Text-driven diffusion models have significantly advanced the image editing performance by using text prompts as inputs. One crucial step in text-driven image editing is to invert the original image into a latent noise code conditioned on the source prompt. While previous methods have achieved promising results by refactoring the image synthesizing process, the inverted latent noise code is tightly coupled with the source prompt, limiting the image editability by target text prompts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Source Prompt Disentangled Inversion (SPDInv), which aims at reducing the impact of source prompt, thereby enhancing the text-driven image editing performance by employing diffusion models. To make the inverted noise code be independent of the given source prompt as much as possible, we indicate that the iterative inversion process should satisfy a fixed-point constraint. Consequently, we transform the inversion problem into a searching problem to find the fixed-point solution, and utilize the pre-trained diffusion models to facilitate the searching process. The experimental results show that our proposed SPDInv method can effectively mitigate the conflicts between the target editing prompt and the source prompt, leading to a significant decrease in editing artifacts. In addition to text-driven image editing, with SPDInv we can easily adapt customized image generation models to localized editing tasks and produce promising performance.

- **Summary**: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning models. However, existing works applying KD to QAT require tedious hyper-parameter tuning to balance the weights of different loss terms, assume the availability of labeled training data, and require complex, computationally intensive training procedures for good performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Quantization-Aware Knowledge Distillation (SQAKD) framework. SQAKD first unifies the forward and backward dynamics of various quantization functions, making it flexible for incorporating various QAT works. Then it formulates QAT as a co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the KL-Loss between the full-precision and low-bit models for KD and the discretization error for quantization, without supervision from labels. A comprehensive evaluation shows that SQAKD substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art QAT and KD works for a variety of model architectures.

- **Summary**: Our paper introduces a novel two-stage self-supervised approach for detecting co-occurring salient objects (CoSOD) in image groups without requiring segmentation annotations. Unlike existing unsupervised methods that rely solely on patch-level information (e.g. clustering patch descriptors) or on computation heavy off-the-shelf components for CoSOD, our lightweight model leverages feature correspondences at both patch and region levels, significantly improving prediction performance. In the first stage, we train a self-supervised network that detects co-salient regions by computing local patch-level feature correspondences across images. We obtain the segmentation predictions using confidence-based adaptive thresholding. In the next stage, we refine these intermediate segmentations by eliminating the detected regions (within each image) whose averaged feature representations are dissimilar to the foreground feature representation averaged across all the cross-attention maps (from the previous stage). Extensive experiments on three CoSOD benchmark datasets show that our self-supervised model outperforms the corresponding state-of-the-art models by a huge margin (e.g. on the CoCA dataset, our model has a 13.7% F-measure gain over the SOTA unsupervised CoSOD model). Notably, our self-supervised model also outperforms several recent fully supervised CoSOD models on the three test datasets (e.g., on the CoCA dataset, our model has a 4.6% F-measure gain over a recent supervised CoSOD model).

- **Summary**: In this work, we show that synthetic data created by generative models is complementary to computer graphics (CG) rendered data for achieving remarkable generalization performance on diverse real-world scenes for 3D human pose and shape estimation (HPS). Specifically, we propose an effective approach based on recent diffusion models, termed HumanWild, which can effortlessly generate human images and corresponding 3D mesh annotations. We first collect a large-scale human-centric dataset with comprehensive annotations, e.g., text captions and surface normal images. Then, we train a customized ControlNet model upon this dataset to generate diverse human images and initial ground-truth labels. At the core of this step is that we can easily obtain numerous surface normal images from a 3D human parametric model, e.g., SMPL-X, by rendering the 3D mesh onto the image plane. As there exists inevitable noise in the initial labels, we then apply an off-the-shelf foundation segmentation model, i.e., SAM, to filter negative data samples. Our data generation pipeline is flexible and customizable to facilitate different real-world tasks, e.g., ego-centric scenes and perspective-distortion scenes. The generated dataset comprises 0.79M images with corresponding 3D annotations, covering versatile viewpoints, scenes, and human identities. We train various HPS regressors on top of the generated data and evaluate them on a wide range of benchmarks (3DPW, RICH, EgoBody, AGORA, SSP-3D) to verify the effectiveness of the generated data. By exclusively employing generative models, we generate large-scale in-the-wild human images and high-quality annotations, eliminating the need for real-world data collection.

- **Summary**: Rotation invariance is an important requirement for point shape analysis. To achieve this, current state-of-the-art methods attempt to construct the local rotation-invariant representation through learning or defining the local reference frame (LRF). Although efficient, these LRF-based methods suffer from perturbation of local geometric relations, resulting in suboptimal local rotation invariance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Local-consistent Transformation (LocoTrans) learning strategy. Specifically, we first construct the local-consistent reference frame (LCRF) by considering the symmetry of the two axes in LRF. In comparison with previous LRFs, our LCRF is able to preserve local geometric relationships better through performing local-consistent transformation. However, as the consistency only exists in local regions, the relative pose information is still lost in the intermediate layers of the network. We mitigate such a relative pose issue by developing a relative pose recovery (RPR) module. RPR aims to restore the relative pose between adjacent transformed patches. Equipped with LCRF and RPR, our LocoTrans is capable of learning local-consistent transformation and preserving local geometry, which benefits rotation invariance learning. Competitive performance under arbitrary rotations on both shape classification and part segmentation tasks and ablations can demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be available publicly at https://github.com/wdttt/LocoTrans.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The challenge of hallucination, prevalent in LLMs, also emerges in LVLMs. However, most existing efforts mainly focus on object hallucination in LVLM, ignoring diverse types of LVLM hallucinations. In this study, we delve into the Intrinsic Vision-Language Hallucination (IVL-Hallu) issue, thoroughly analyzing different types of IVL-Hallu on their causes and reflections. Specifically, we propose several novel IVL-Hallu tasks and categorize them into four types: (a) object hallucination, which arises from the misidentification of objects, (b) attribute hallucination, which is caused by the misidentification of attributes, (c) multi-modal conflicting hallucination, which derives from the contradictions between textual and visual information, and (d) counter-common-sense hallucination, which owes to the contradictions between the LVLM knowledge and actual images. Based on these taxonomies, we propose a more challenging benchmark named PhD to evaluate and explore IVL-Hallu. An automated pipeline is proposed for generating different types of IVL-Hallu data. Extensive experiments on five SOTA LVLMs reveal their inability to effectively tackle our proposed IVL-Hallu tasks, with detailed analyses and insights on the origins and possible solutions of these new challenging IVL-Hallu tasks, facilitating future researches on IVL-Hallu and LVLM.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a Transformer-based integrative feature and cost aggregation network designed for dense matching tasks. In the context of dense matching, many works benefit from one of two forms of aggregation: feature aggregation, which pertains to the alignment of similar features, or cost aggregation, a procedure aimed at instilling coherence in the flow estimates across neighboring pixels. In this work, we first show that feature aggregation and cost aggregation exhibit distinct characteristics and reveal the potential for substantial benefits stemming from the judicious use of both aggregation processes. We then introduce a simple yet effective architecture that harnesses self- and cross-attention mechanisms to show that our approach unifies feature aggregation and cost aggregation and effectively harnesses the strengths of both techniques. Within the proposed attention layers, the features and cost volume both complement each other, and the attention layers are interleaved through a coarse-to-fine design to further promote accurate correspondence estimation. Finally at inference, our network produces multi-scale predictions, computes their confidence scores, and selects the most confident flow for final prediction. Our framework is evaluated on standard benchmarks for semantic matching, and also applied to geometric matching, where we show that our approach achieves significant improvements compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Person Re-identification (ReID) has been extensively developed for a decade in order to learn the association of images of the same person across non-overlapping camera views. To overcome significant variations between images across camera views, mountains of variants of ReID models were developed for solving a number of challenges, such as resolution change, clothing change, occlusion, modality change, and so on. Despite the impressive performance of many ReID variants, these variants typically function distinctly and cannot be applied to other challenges. To our best knowledge, there is no versatile ReID model that can handle various ReID challenges at the same time. This work contributes to the first attempt at learning a versatile ReID model to solve such a problem. Our main idea is to form a two-stage prompt-based twin modeling framework called VersReID. Our VersReID firstly leverages the scene label to train a ReID Bank that contains abundant knowledge for handling various scenes, where several groups of scene-specific prompts are used to encode different scene-specific knowledge. In the second stage, we distill a V-Branch model with versatile prompts from the ReID Bank for adaptively solving the ReID of different scenes, eliminating the demand for scene labels during the inference stage. To facilitate training VersReID, we further introduce the multi-scene properties into self-supervised learning of ReID via a multi-scene prioris data augmentation (MPDA) strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the success of learning an effective and versatile ReID model for handling ReID tasks under multi-scene conditions without manual assignment of scene labels in the inference stage, including general, low-resolution, clothing change, occlusion, and cross-modality scenes. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/VersReID.

- **Summary**: Few-shot segmentation models excel in metal defect detection due to their rapid generalization ability to new classes and pixel-level segmentation, rendering them ideal for addressing data scarcity issues and achieving refined object delineation in industrial applications. Existing works neglect the \textit{Intra-Class Differences}, inherent in metal surface defect data, which hinders the model from learning sufficient knowledge from the support set to guide the query set segmentation. Specifically, it can be categorized into two types: the \textit{Semantic Difference} induced by internal factors in metal samples and the \textit{Distortion Difference} caused by external factors of surroundings. To address these differences, we introduce a \textbf{L}ocal d\textbf{E}scriptor based \textbf{R}easoning and \textbf{E}xcitation \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{LERENet}) to learn the two-view guidance, i.e., local and global information from the graph and feature space, and fuse them to segment precisely. Since the relation structure of local features embedded in graph space will help to eliminate \textit{Semantic Difference}, we employ Multi-Prototype Reasoning (MPR) module, extracting local descriptors based prototypes and analyzing local-view feature relevance in support-query pairs. Besides, due to the global information that will assist in countering the \textit{Distortion Difference} in observations, we utilize Multi-Prototype Excitation (MPE) module to capture the global-view relations in support-query pairs. Finally, we employ an Information Fusion Module (IFM) to fuse learned prototypes in local and global views to generate pixel-level masks. Our comprehensive experiments on defect datasets demonstrate that it outperforms existing benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Oriented object detection, an emerging task in recent years, aims to identify and locate objects across varied orientations. This requires the detector to accurately capture the orientation information, which varies significantly within and across images. Despite the existing substantial efforts, simultaneously ensuring model effectiveness and parameter efficiency remains challenging in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a lightweight yet effective Group-wise Rotating and Attention (GRA) module to replace the convolution operations in backbone networks for oriented object detection. GRA can adaptively capture fine-grained features of objects with diverse orientations, comprising two key components: Group-wise Rotating and Group-wise Attention. Group-wise Rotating first divides the convolution kernel into groups, where each group extracts different object features by rotating at a specific angle according to the object orientation. Subsequently, Group-wise Attention is employed to adaptively enhance the object-related regions in the feature. The collaborative effort of these components enables GRA to effectively capture the various orientation information while maintaining parameter efficiency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method. For example, GRA achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the DOTA-v2.0 benchmark, while saving the parameters by nearly 50% compared to the previous SOTA method. Code will be released.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have sparked significant demand for their integration into real-world 3D applications. However, the varied functionalities required by different 3D applications often necessitate diverse NeRF models with various pipelines, leading to tedious NeRF training for each target task and cumbersome trial-and-error experiments. Drawing inspiration from the generalization capability and adaptability of emerging foundation models, our work aims to develop one general-purpose NeRF for handling diverse 3D tasks. We achieve this by proposing a framework called Omni-Recon, which is capable of (1) generalizable 3D reconstruction and zero-shot multitask scene understanding, and (2) adaptability to diverse downstream 3D applications such as real-time rendering and scene editing. Our key insight is that an image-based rendering pipeline, with accurate geometry and appearance estimation, can lift 2D image features into their 3D counterparts, thus extending widely explored 2D tasks to the 3D world in a generalizable manner. Specifically, our Omni-Recon features a general-purpose NeRF model using image-based rendering with two decoupled branches: one complex transformer-based branch that progressively fuses geometry and appearance features for accurate geometry estimation, and one lightweight branch for predicting blending weights of source views. This design achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalizable 3D surface reconstruction quality with blending weights reusable across diverse tasks for zero-shot multitask scene understanding. In addition, it can enable real-time rendering after baking the complex geometry branch into meshes, swift adaptation to achieve SOTA generalizable 3D understanding performance, and seamless integration with 2D diffusion models for text-guided 3D editing.

- **Summary**: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has greatly accelerated the rendering speed of novel view synthesis. Unlike neural implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that represent a 3D scene with position and viewpoint-conditioned neural networks, 3D Gaussian Splatting utilizes a set of Gaussian ellipsoids to model the scene so that efficient rendering can be accomplished by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids into images. Apart from the fast rendering speed, the explicit representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting facilitates editing tasks like dynamic reconstruction, geometry editing, and physical simulation. Considering the rapid change and growing number of works in this field, we present a literature review of recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, which can be roughly classified into 3D reconstruction, 3D editing, and other downstream applications by functionality. Traditional point-based rendering methods and the rendering formulation of 3D Gaussian Splatting are also illustrated for a better understanding of this technique. This survey aims to help beginners get into this field quickly and provide experienced researchers with a comprehensive overview, which can stimulate the future development of the 3D Gaussian Splatting representation.

- **Summary**: Accurate and early detection of breast cancer is essential for successful treatment. This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach for improved breast cancer classification in histopathological images, a crucial step in diagnosis. Our method hinges on the Dense Residual Dual-Shuffle Attention Network (DRDA-Net), inspired by ShuffleNet's efficient architecture. DRDA-Net achieves exceptional accuracy across various magnification levels on the BreaKHis dataset, a breast cancer histopathology analysis benchmark. However, for real-world deployment, computational efficiency is paramount. We integrate a pre-trained MobileNet model renowned for its lightweight design to address computational. MobileNet ensures fast execution even on devices with limited resources without sacrificing performance. This combined approach offers a promising solution for accurate breast cancer diagnosis, paving the way for faster and more accessible screening procedures.

- **Summary**: This paper develops small vision language models to understand visual art, which, given an art work, aims to identify its emotion category and explain this prediction with natural language. While small models are computationally efficient, their capacity is much limited compared with large models. To break this trade-off, this paper builds a small emotional vision language model (SEVLM) by emotion modeling and input-output feature alignment. On the one hand, based on valence-arousal-dominance (VAD) knowledge annotated by psychology experts, we introduce and fuse emotional features derived through VAD dictionary and a VAD head to align VAD vectors of predicted emotion explanation and the ground truth. This allows the vision language model to better understand and generate emotional texts, compared with using traditional text embeddings alone. On the other hand, we design a contrastive head to pull close embeddings of the image, its emotion class, and explanation, which aligns model outputs and inputs. On two public affective explanation datasets, we show that the proposed techniques consistently improve the visual art understanding performance of baseline SEVLMs. Importantly, the proposed model can be trained and evaluated on a single RTX 2080 Ti while exhibiting very strong performance: it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art small models but is also competitive compared with LLaVA 7B after fine-tuning and GPT4(V).

- **Summary**: Universal image restoration is a practical and potential computer vision task for real-world applications. The main challenge of this task is handling the different degradation distributions at once. Existing methods mainly utilize task-specific conditions (e.g., prompt) to guide the model to learn different distributions separately, named multi-partite mapping. However, it is not suitable for universal model learning as it ignores the shared information between different tasks. In this work, we propose an advanced selective hourglass mapping strategy based on diffusion model, termed DiffUIR. Two novel considerations make our DiffUIR non-trivial. Firstly, we equip the model with strong condition guidance to obtain accurate generation direction of diffusion model (selective). More importantly, DiffUIR integrates a flexible shared distribution term (SDT) into the diffusion algorithm elegantly and naturally, which gradually maps different distributions into a shared one. In the reverse process, combined with SDT and strong condition guidance, DiffUIR iteratively guides the shared distribution to the task-specific distribution with high image quality (hourglass). Without bells and whistles, by only modifying the mapping strategy, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on five image restoration tasks, 22 benchmarks in the universal setting and zero-shot generalization setting. Surprisingly, by only using a lightweight model (only 0.89M), we could achieve outstanding performance.

Despite their success, concerns exist about potential copyright violations stemming from the use of unauthorized data in this process. In response, we present Contrasting Gradient Inversion for Diffusion Models (CGI-DM), a novel method featuring vivid visual representations for digital copyright authentication. Our approach involves removing partial information of an image and recovering missing details by exploiting conceptual differences between the pretrained and fine-tuned models. We formulate the differences as KL divergence between latent variables of the two models when given the same input image, which can be maximized through Monte Carlo sampling and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). The similarity between original and recovered images serves as a strong indicator of potential infringements. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and Dreambooth datasets demonstrate the high accuracy of CGI-DM in digital copyright authentication, surpassing alternative validation techniques.

- **Summary**: In the era of AIGC, the fast development of visual content generation technologies, such as diffusion models, bring potential security risks to our society. Existing generated image detection methods suffer from performance drop when faced with out-of-domain generators and image scenes. To relieve this problem, we propose Artifact Purification Network (APN) to facilitate the artifact extraction from generated images through the explicit and implicit purification processes. For the explicit one, a suspicious frequency-band proposal method and a spatial feature decomposition method are proposed to extract artifact-related features. For the implicit one, a training strategy based on mutual information estimation is proposed to further purify the artifact-related features. Experiments show that for cross-generator detection, the average accuracy of APN is 5.6% ~ 16.4% higher than the previous 10 methods on GenImage dataset and 1.7% ~ 50.1% on DiffusionForensics dataset. For cross-scene detection, APN maintains its high performance. Via visualization analysis, we find that the proposed method extracts flexible forgery patterns and condenses the forgery information diluted in irrelevant features. We also find that the artifact features APN focuses on across generators and scenes are global and diverse. The code will be available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) focuses on designing methods to measure image quality in alignment with human perception when a high-quality reference image is unavailable. The reliance on annotated Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) in the majority of state-of-the-art NR-IQA approaches limits their scalability and broader applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose QualiCLIP (Quality-aware CLIP), a CLIP-based self-supervised opinion-unaware method that does not require labeled MOS. In particular, we introduce a quality-aware image-text alignment strategy to make CLIP generate representations that correlate with the inherent quality of the images. Starting from pristine images, we synthetically degrade them with increasing levels of intensity. Then, we train CLIP to rank these degraded images based on their similarity to quality-related antonym text prompts, while guaranteeing consistent representations for images with comparable quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets with authentic distortions. Moreover, despite not requiring MOS, QualiCLIP outperforms supervised methods when their training dataset differs from the testing one, thus proving to be more suitable for real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates greater robustness and improved explainability than competing methods. The code and the model are publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/QualiCLIP.

- **Summary**: Recently, One-stage Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has gained increasing interest due to simplification over its cumbersome multi-stage counterpart. Limited by the inherent ambiguity of Class Activation Map (CAM), we observe that one-stage pipelines often encounter confirmation bias caused by incorrect CAM pseudo-labels, impairing their final segmentation performance. Although recent works discard many unreliable pseudo-labels to implicitly alleviate this issue, they fail to exploit sufficient supervision for their models. To this end, we propose a dual student framework with trustworthy progressive learning (DuPL). Specifically, we propose a dual student network with a discrepancy loss to yield diverse CAMs for each sub-net. The two sub-nets generate supervision for each other, mitigating the confirmation bias caused by learning their own incorrect pseudo-labels. In this process, we progressively introduce more trustworthy pseudo-labels to be involved in the supervision through dynamic threshold adjustment with an adaptive noise filtering strategy. Moreover, we believe that every pixel, even discarded from supervision due to its unreliability, is important for WSSS. Thus, we develop consistency regularization on these discarded regions, providing supervision of every pixel. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DuPL over the recent state-of-the-art alternatives on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets.

- **Summary**: The complex dynamicity of open-world objects presents non-negligible challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), often manifested as severe deformations, fast motion, and occlusions. Most methods that solely depend on coarse-grained object cues, such as boxes and the overall appearance of the object, are susceptible to degradation due to distorted internal relationships of dynamic objects. To address this problem, this work proposes NetTrack, an efficient, generic, and affordable tracking framework to introduce fine-grained learning that is robust to dynamicity. Specifically, NetTrack constructs a dynamicity-aware association with a fine-grained Net, leveraging point-level visual cues. Correspondingly, a fine-grained sampler and matching method have been incorporated. Furthermore, NetTrack learns object-text correspondence for fine-grained localization. To evaluate MOT in extremely dynamic open-world scenarios, a bird flock tracking (BFT) dataset is constructed, which exhibits high dynamicity with diverse species and open-world scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation on BFT validates the effectiveness of fine-grained learning on object dynamicity, and thorough transfer experiments on challenging open-world benchmarks, i.e., TAO, TAO-OW, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40, validate the strong generalization ability of NetTrack even without finetuning.

- **Summary**: The crux of semi-supervised temporal action localization (SS-TAL) lies in excavating valuable information from abundant unlabeled videos. However, current approaches predominantly focus on building models that are robust to the error-prone target class (i.e, the predicted class with the highest confidence) while ignoring informative semantics within non-target classes. This paper approaches SS-TAL from a novel perspective by advocating for learning from non-target classes, transcending the conventional focus solely on the target class. The proposed approach involves partitioning the label space of the predicted class distribution into distinct subspaces: target class, positive classes, negative classes, and ambiguous classes, aiming to mine both positive and negative semantics that are absent in the target class, while excluding ambiguous classes. To this end, we first devise innovative strategies to adaptively select high-quality positive and negative classes from the label space, by modeling both the confidence and rank of a class in relation to those of the target class. Then, we introduce novel positive and negative losses designed to guide the learning process, pushing predictions closer to positive classes and away from negative classes. Finally, the positive and negative processes are integrated into a hybrid positive-negative learning framework, facilitating the utilization of non-target classes in both labeled and unlabeled videos. Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Due to the difficulty of collecting real paired data, most existing desmoking methods train the models by synthesizing smoke, generalizing poorly to real surgical scenarios. Although a few works have explored single-image real-world desmoking in unpaired learning manners, they still encounter challenges in handling dense smoke. In this work, we address these issues together by introducing the self-supervised surgery video desmoking (SelfSVD). On the one hand, we observe that the frame captured before the activation of high-energy devices is generally clear (named pre-smoke frame, PS frame), thus it can serve as supervision for other smoky frames, making real-world self-supervised video desmoking practically feasible. On the other hand, in order to enhance the desmoking performance, we further feed the valuable information from PS frame into models, where a masking strategy and a regularization term are presented to avoid trivial solutions. In addition, we construct a real surgery video dataset for desmoking, which covers a variety of smoky scenes. Extensive experiments on the dataset show that our SelfSVD can remove smoke more effectively and efficiently while recovering more photo-realistic details than the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching is a core task for many computer vision and robotics applications. Despite their dominance in traditional stereo methods, the hand-crafted Markov Random Field (MRF) models lack sufficient modeling accuracy compared to end-to-end deep models. While deep learning representations have greatly improved the unary terms of the MRF models, the overall accuracy is still severely limited by the hand-crafted pairwise terms and message passing. To address these issues, we propose a neural MRF model, where both potential functions and message passing are designed using data-driven neural networks. Our fully data-driven model is built on the foundation of variational inference theory, to prevent convergence issues and retain stereo MRF's graph inductive bias. To make the inference tractable and scale well to high-resolution images, we also propose a Disparity Proposal Network (DPN) to adaptively prune the search space of disparity. The proposed approach ranks $1^{st}$ on both KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards among all published methods while running faster than 100 ms. This approach significantly outperforms prior global methods, e.g., lowering D1 metric by more than 50% on KITTI 2015. In addition, our method exhibits strong cross-domain generalization and can recover sharp edges. The codes at https://github.com/aeolusguan/NMRF .

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is essential in computer vision for various applications, yet traditional approaches face significant challenges, including the high cost of annotation and extensive training for supervised learning. Additionally, due to the limited predefined categories in supervised learning, models typically struggle with infrequent classes and are unable to predict novel classes. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiffusion, an innovative approach that leverages pretrained frozen Stable Diffusion to achieve open-vocabulary semantic segmentation without the need for additional training or annotation, leading to improved performance compared to similar methods. We also demonstrate the superior performance of MaskDiffusion in handling open vocabularies, including fine-grained and proper noun-based categories, thus expanding the scope of segmentation applications. Overall, our MaskDiffusion shows significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in contrast to other comparable unsupervised segmentation methods, i.e. on the Potsdam dataset (+10.5 mIoU compared to GEM) and COCO-Stuff (+14.8 mIoU compared to DiffSeg).

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, where each pixel in an image is classified into a category. However, traditional methods face significant challenges, including the need for pixel-level annotations and extensive training. Furthermore, because supervised learning uses a limited set of predefined categories, models typically struggle with rare classes and cannot recognize new ones. Unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation, proposed to tackle these issues, faces challenges, including the inability to assign specific class labels to clusters and the necessity of user-provided text queries for guidance. In this context, we propose a novel approach, TAG which achieves Training, Annotation, and Guidance-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. TAG utilizes pre-trained models such as CLIP and DINO to segment images into meaningful categories without additional training or dense annotations. It retrieves class labels from an external database, providing flexibility to adapt to new scenarios. Our TAG achieves state-of-the-art results on PascalVOC, PascalContext and ADE20K for open-vocabulary segmentation without given class names, i.e. improvement of +15.3 mIoU on PascalVOC. All code and data will be released at https://github.com/Valkyrja3607/TAG.

- **Summary**: Reconstructions of visual perception from brain activity have improved tremendously, but the practical utility of such methods has been limited. This is because such models are trained independently per subject where each subject requires dozens of hours of expensive fMRI training data to attain high-quality results. The present work showcases high-quality reconstructions using only 1 hour of fMRI training data. We pretrain our model across 7 subjects and then fine-tune on minimal data from a new subject. Our novel functional alignment procedure linearly maps all brain data to a shared-subject latent space, followed by a shared non-linear mapping to CLIP image space. We then map from CLIP space to pixel space by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion XL to accept CLIP latents as inputs instead of text. This approach improves out-of-subject generalization with limited training data and also attains state-of-the-art image retrieval and reconstruction metrics compared to single-subject approaches. MindEye2 demonstrates how accurate reconstructions of perception are possible from a single visit to the MRI facility. All code is available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses new methodologies to deal with the challenging task of generating dynamic Human-Object Interactions from textual descriptions (Text2HOI). While most existing works assume interactions with limited body parts or static objects, our task involves addressing the variation in human motion, the diversity of object shapes, and the semantic vagueness of object motion simultaneously. To tackle this, we propose a novel Text-guided Human-Object Interaction diffusion model with Relation Intervention (THOR). THOR is a cohesive diffusion model equipped with a relation intervention mechanism. In each diffusion step, we initiate text-guided human and object motion and then leverage human-object relations to intervene in object motion. This intervention enhances the spatial-temporal relations between humans and objects, with human-centric interaction representation providing additional guidance for synthesizing consistent motion from text. To achieve more reasonable and realistic results, interaction losses is introduced at different levels of motion granularity. Moreover, we construct Text-BEHAVE, a Text2HOI dataset that seamlessly integrates textual descriptions with the currently largest publicly available 3D HOI dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

- **Summary**: The annotation of digital pathological slide data for renal cell carcinoma is of paramount importance for correct diagnosis of artificial intelligence models due to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor. This process not only facilitates a deeper understanding of renal cell cancer heterogeneity but also aims to minimize noise in the data for more accurate studies. To enhance the applicability of the data, two pathologists were enlisted to meticulously curate, screen, and label a kidney cancer pathology image dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) database. Subsequently, a Resnet model was developed to validate the annotated dataset against an additional dataset from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. Based on these results, we have meticulously compiled the TCGA digital pathological dataset with independent labeling of tumor regions and adjacent areas (RCdpia), which includes 109 cases of kidney chromophobe cell carcinoma, 486 cases of kidney clear cell carcinoma, and 292 cases of kidney papillary cell carcinoma. This dataset is now publicly accessible at http://39.171.241.18:8888/RCdpia/. Furthermore, model analysis has revealed significant discrepancies in predictive outcomes when applying the same model to datasets from different centers. Leveraging the RCdpia, we can now develop more precise digital pathology artificial intelligence models for tasks such as normalization, classification, and segmentation. These advancements underscore the potential for more nuanced and accurate AI applications in the field of digital pathology.

- **Summary**: Object detection methods under known single degradations have been extensively investigated. However, existing approaches require prior knowledge of the degradation type and train a separate model for each, limiting their practical applications in unpredictable environments. To address this challenge, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompted adaptive enhancer, CPA-Enhancer, for object detection under unknown degradations. Specifically, CPA-Enhancer progressively adapts its enhancement strategy under the step-by-step guidance of CoT prompts, that encode degradation-related information. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first work that exploits CoT prompting for object detection tasks. Overall, CPA-Enhancer is a plug-and-play enhancement model that can be integrated into any generic detectors to achieve substantial gains on degraded images, without knowing the degradation type priorly. Experimental results demonstrate that CPA-Enhancer not only sets the new state of the art for object detection but also boosts the performance of other downstream vision tasks under unknown degradations.

- **Summary**: Spike cameras, leveraging spike-based integration sampling and high temporal resolution, offer distinct advantages over standard cameras. However, existing approaches reliant on spike cameras often assume optimal illumination, a condition frequently unmet in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce SpikeNeRF, the first work that derives a NeRF-based volumetric scene representation from spike camera data. Our approach leverages NeRF's multi-view consistency to establish robust self-supervision, effectively eliminating erroneous measurements and uncovering coherent structures within exceedingly noisy input amidst diverse real-world illumination scenarios. The framework comprises two core elements: a spike generation model incorporating an integrate-and-fire neuron layer and parameters accounting for non-idealities, such as threshold variation, and a spike rendering loss capable of generalizing across varying illumination conditions. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views from the novel continuous spike stream, demonstrating advantages over other vision sensors in certain scenes. Empirical evaluations conducted on both real and novel realistically simulated sequences affirm the efficacy of our methodology. The dataset and source code are released at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/SpikeNeRF.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable performance in medical image segmentation in a fully supervised manner, but requires precise annotations. To reduce the annotation cost and maintain satisfactory performance, in this work, we leverage the capabilities of SAM for establishing semi-supervised medical image segmentation models. Rethinking the requirements of effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility, we propose a three-stage framework, i.e., Concatenate, Fine-tuning, and Re-training (CFR). The current fine-tuning approaches mostly involve 2D slice-wise fine-tuning that disregards the contextual information between adjacent slices. Our concatenation strategy mitigates the mismatch between natural and 3D medical images. The concatenated images are then used for fine-tuning SAM, providing robust initialization pseudo-labels. Afterwards, we train a 3D semi-supervised segmentation model while maintaining the same parameter size as the conventional segmenter such as V-Net. Our CFR framework is plug-and-play, and easily compatible with various popular semi-supervised methods. Extensive experiments validate that our CFR achieves significant improvements in both moderate annotation and scarce annotation across four datasets. In particular, CFR framework improves the Dice score of Mean Teacher from 29.68% to 74.40% with only one labeled data of LA dataset.

- **Summary**: This study explores the use of deep learning techniques for analyzing lung Computed Tomography (CT) images. Classic deep learning approaches face challenges with varying slice counts and resolutions in CT images, a diversity arising from the utilization of assorted scanning equipment. Typically, predictions are made on single slices which are then combined for a comprehensive outcome. Yet, this method does not incorporate learning features specific to each slice, leading to a compromise in effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose an advanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically tailored for CT scans. It aims to filter out out-of-distribution (OOD) data within the entire CT scan, allowing us to select essential spatial-slice features for analysis by reducing data redundancy by 70\%. Additionally, we introduce a Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to enhance stability during training and inference phases, thereby accelerating convergence and enhancing overall performance. Remarkably, our experiments reveal that our model achieves promising results with a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed on the COVID-19-CT-DB datasets provided by the DEF-AI-MIA workshop.

- **Summary**: Many autonomous robotic applications require object-level understanding when deployed. Actively reconstructing objects of interest, i.e. objects with specific semantic meanings, is therefore relevant for a robot to perform downstream tasks in an initially unknown environment. In this work, we propose a novel framework for semantic-targeted active reconstruction using posed RGB-D measurements and 2D semantic labels as input. The key components of our framework are a semantic implicit neural representation and a compatible planning utility function based on semantic rendering and uncertainty estimation, enabling adaptive view planning to target objects of interest. Our planning approach achieves better reconstruction performance in terms of mesh and novel view rendering quality compared to implicit reconstruction baselines that do not consider semantics for view planning. Our framework further outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic-targeted active reconstruction pipeline based on explicit maps, justifying our choice of utilising implicit neural representations to tackle semantic-targeted active reconstruction problems.

- **Summary**: Domain adaptation is a critical task in machine learning that aims to improve model performance on a target domain by leveraging knowledge from a related source domain. In this work, we introduce Universal Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (UniSSDA), a practical yet challenging setting where the target domain is partially labeled, and the source and target label space may not strictly match. UniSSDA is at the intersection of Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) and Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA): the UniDA setting does not allow for fine-grained categorization of target private classes not represented in the source domain, while SSDA focuses on the restricted closed-set setting where source and target label spaces match exactly. Existing UniDA and SSDA methods are susceptible to common-class bias in UniSSDA settings, where models overfit to data distributions of classes common to both domains at the expense of private classes. We propose a new prior-guided pseudo-label refinement strategy to reduce the reinforcement of common-class bias due to pseudo-labeling, a common label propagation strategy in domain adaptation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets Office-Home, DomainNet, and VisDA. The proposed strategy attains the best performance across UniSSDA adaptation settings and establishes a new baseline for UniSSDA.

- **Summary**: Interactions between human and objects are influenced not only by the object's pose and shape, but also by physical attributes such as object mass and surface friction. They introduce important motion nuances that are essential for diversity and realism. Despite advancements in recent kinematics-based methods, this aspect has been overlooked. Generating nuanced human motion presents two challenges. First, it is non-trivial to learn from multi-modal human and object information derived from both the physical and non-physical attributes. Second, there exists no dataset capturing nuanced human interactions with objects of varying physical properties, hampering model development. This work addresses the gap by introducing the FORCE model, a kinematic approach for synthesizing diverse, nuanced human-object interactions by modeling physical attributes. Our key insight is that human motion is dictated by the interrelation between the force exerted by the human and the perceived resistance. Guided by a novel intuitive physics encoding, the model captures the interplay between human force and resistance. Experiments also demonstrate incorporating human force facilitates learning multi-class motion. Accompanying our model, we contribute the FORCE dataset. It features diverse, different-styled motion through interactions with varying resistances.

- **Summary**: Recent work has shown that 3D Gaussian-based SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction, accurate pose estimation, and real-time rendering of scenes. However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs, and slow training speed. To address the limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then we observe that the covariance matrix (geometry) of most 3D Gaussian ellipsoids are extremely similar, which motivates a novel geometry codebook to compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes, i.e., the parameters. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training and rendering speed while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation.

- **Summary**: The introduction of YOLOv9, the latest version of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, has led to its widespread adoption across various scenarios. This paper is the first to apply the YOLOv9 algorithm model to the fracture detection task as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) to help radiologists and surgeons to interpret X-ray images. Specifically, this paper trained the model on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset and extended the training set using data augmentation techniques to improve the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the mAP 50-95 of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the YOLOv9 model increased the value from 42.16% to 43.73%, with an improvement of 3.7%.

- **Summary**: Most of the computer vision architectures nowadays are built upon the well-known foundation operations: fully-connected layers, convolutions and multi-head self-attention blocks. In this paper we propose a novel foundation operation - NeoCell - which learns matrix patterns and performs patchwise matrix multiplications with the input data. The main advantages of the proposed operator are (1) simple implementation without need in operations like im2col, (2) low computational complexity (especially for large matrices) and (3) simple and flexible implementation of up-/down-sampling. We validate NeoNeXt family of models based on this operation on ImageNet-1K classification task and show that they achieve competitive quality.

- **Summary**: Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) aims to enable the utilization of a pre-trained source model in an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Self-training is a way to solve SFUDA, where confident target samples are iteratively selected as pseudo-labeled samples to guide target model learning. However, prior heuristic noisy pseudo-label filtering methods all involve introducing extra models, which are sensitive to model assumptions and may introduce additional errors or mislabeling. In this work, we propose a method called Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label-filtering Adaptation (UPA) to efficiently address this issue in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specially, we first introduce a sample selection module named Adaptive Pseudo-label Selection (APS), which is responsible for filtering noisy pseudo labels. The APS utilizes a simple sample uncertainty estimation method by aggregating knowledge from neighboring samples and confident samples are selected as clean pseudo-labeled. Additionally, we incorporate Class-Aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) to mitigate the memorization of pseudo-label noise by learning robust pair-wise representation supervised by pseudo labels. Through extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art SFUDA methods.

- **Summary**: Facial sketches are both a concise way of showing the identity of a person and a means to express artistic intention. While a few techniques have recently emerged that allow sketches to be extracted in different styles, they typically rely on a large amount of data that is difficult to obtain. Here, we propose StyleSketch, a method for extracting high-resolution stylized sketches from a face image. Using the rich semantics of the deep features from a pretrained StyleGAN, we are able to train a sketch generator with 16 pairs of face and the corresponding sketch images. The sketch generator utilizes part-based losses with two-stage learning for fast convergence during training for high-quality sketch extraction. Through a set of comparisons, we show that StyleSketch outperforms existing state-of-the-art sketch extraction methods and few-shot image adaptation methods for the task of extracting high-resolution abstract face sketches. We further demonstrate the versatility of StyleSketch by extending its use to other domains and explore the possibility of semantic editing.

- **Summary**: Depth completion aims to derive a dense depth map from sparse depth measurements with a synchronized color image. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are predominantly propagation-based, which work as an iterative refinement on the initial estimated dense depth. However, the initial depth estimations mostly result from direct applications of convolutional layers on the sparse depth map. In this paper, we present a Bilateral Propagation Network (BP-Net), that propagates depth at the earliest stage to avoid directly convolving on sparse data. Specifically, our approach propagates the target depth from nearby depth measurements via a non-linear model, whose coefficients are generated through a multi-layer perceptron conditioned on both \emph{radiometric difference} and \emph{spatial distance}. By integrating bilateral propagation with multi-modal fusion and depth refinement in a multi-scale framework, our BP-Net demonstrates outstanding performance on both indoor and outdoor scenes. It achieves SOTA on the NYUv2 dataset and ranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion benchmark at the time of submission. Experimental results not only show the effectiveness of bilateral propagation but also emphasize the significance of early-stage propagation in contrast to the refinement stage. Our code and trained models will be available on the project page.



### BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

- **Summary**: Currently, personalized image generation methods mostly require considerable time to finetune and often overfit the concept resulting in generated images that are similar to custom concepts but difficult to edit by prompts. We propose an effective and fast approach that could balance the text-image consistency and identity consistency of the generated image and reference image. Our method can generate personalized images without any fine-tuning while maintaining the inherent text-to-image generation ability of diffusion models. Given a prompt and a reference image, we merge the custom concept into generated images by manipulating cross-attention and self-attention layers of the original diffusion model to generate personalized images that match the text description. Comprehensive experiments highlight the superiority of our method.

- **Summary**: The maintenance, archiving and usage of the design drawings is cumbersome in physical form in different industries for longer period. It is hard to extract information by simple scanning of drawing sheets. Converting them to their digital formats such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD), with needed knowledge extraction can solve this problem. The conversion of these machine drawings to its digital form is a crucial challenge which requires advanced techniques. This research proposes an innovative methodology utilizing Deep Learning methods. The approach employs object detection model, such as Yolov7, Faster R-CNN, to detect physical drawing objects present in the images followed by, edge detection algorithms such as canny filter to extract and refine the identified lines from the drawing region and curve detection techniques to detect circle. Also ornaments (complex shapes) within the drawings are extracted. To ensure comprehensive conversion, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool is integrated to identify and extract the text elements from the drawings. The extracted data which includes the lines, shapes and text is consolidated and stored in a structured comma separated values(.csv) file format. The accuracy and the efficiency of conversion is evaluated. Through this, conversion can be automated to help organizations enhance their productivity, facilitate seamless collaborations and preserve valuable design information in a digital format easily accessible. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of CAD conversions, providing accurate results from the translating process. Future research can focus on handling diverse drawing types, enhanced accuracy in shape and line detection and extraction.

- **Summary**: Rolling shutter (RS) cameras dominate consumer and smartphone markets. Several methods for computing the absolute pose of RS cameras have appeared in the last 20 years, but the relative pose problem has not been fully solved yet. We provide a unified theory for the important class of order-one rolling shutter (RS$_1$) cameras. These cameras generalize the perspective projection to RS cameras, projecting a generic space point to exactly one image point via a rational map. We introduce a new back-projection RS camera model, characterize RS$_1$ cameras, construct explicit parameterizations of such cameras, and determine the image of a space line. We classify all minimal problems for solving the relative camera pose problem with linear RS$_1$ cameras and discover new practical cases. Finally, we show how the theory can be used to explain RS models previously used for absolute pose computation.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in the vision-language model have shown notable generalization in vision-language tasks after visual instruction tuning. However, bridging the gap between the pre-trained vision encoder and the large language models becomes the whole network's bottleneck. To improve cross-modality alignment, existing works usually consider more visual instruction data covering a broader range of vision tasks to fine-tune the model for question-answering, which are costly to obtain. However, the image contains rich contextual information that has been largely under-explored. This paper first attempts to harness this overlooked context within visual instruction data, training the model to self-supervised `learning' how to ask high-quality questions. In this way, we introduce a novel framework named SQ-LLaVA: Self-Questioning for Large Vision-Language Assistant. SQ-LLaVA exhibits proficiency in generating flexible and meaningful image-related questions while analyzing the visual clue and prior language knowledge, signifying an advanced level of generalized visual understanding. Moreover, fine-tuning SQ-LLaVA on higher-quality instruction data shows a consistent performance improvement compared with traditional visual-instruction tuning methods. This improvement highlights the efficacy of self-questioning techniques in achieving a deeper and more nuanced comprehension of visual content across various contexts.

- **Summary**: 3D human pose data collected in controlled laboratory settings present challenges for pose estimators that generalize across diverse scenarios. To address this, domain generalization is employed. Current methodologies in domain generalization for 3D human pose estimation typically utilize adversarial training to generate synthetic poses for training. Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit several limitations. First, the lack of prior information about the target domain complicates the application of suitable augmentation through a single pose augmentor, affecting generalization on target domains. Moreover, adversarial training's discriminator tends to enforce similarity between source and synthesized poses, impeding the exploration of out-of-source distributions. Furthermore, the pose estimator's optimization is not exposed to domain shifts, limiting its overall generalization ability.   To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework featuring two pose augmentors: the weak and the strong augmentors. Our framework employs differential strategies for generation and discrimination processes, facilitating the preservation of knowledge related to source poses and the exploration of out-of-source distributions without prior information about target poses. Besides, we leverage meta-optimization to simulate domain shifts in the optimization process of the pose estimator, thereby improving its generalization ability. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Two approaches have emerged to input images into large language models (LLMs). The first is to caption images into natural language. The second is to map image feature embeddings into the domain of the LLM and pass the mapped embeddings directly to the LLM. The majority of recent few-shot multimodal work reports performance using architectures that employ variations of one of these two approaches. But they overlook an important comparison between them. We design a controlled and focused experiment to compare these two approaches to few-shot visual question answering (VQA) with LLMs. Our findings indicate that for Flan-T5 XL, a 3B parameter LLM, connecting visual embeddings directly to the LLM embedding space does not guarantee improved performance over using image captions. In the zero-shot regime, we find using textual image captions is better. In the few-shot regimes, how the in-context examples are selected determines which is better.

- **Summary**: During the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, the scene's geometry can gradually deteriorate if its structure is not deliberately preserved, especially in non-textured regions such as walls, ceilings, and furniture surfaces. This degradation significantly affects the rendering quality of novel views that deviate significantly from the viewpoints in the training data. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach called GeoGaussian. Based on the smoothly connected areas observed from point clouds, this method introduces a novel pipeline to initialize thin Gaussians aligned with the surfaces, where the characteristic can be transferred to new generations through a carefully designed densification strategy. Finally, the pipeline ensures that the scene's geometry and texture are maintained through constrained optimization processes with explicit geometry constraints. Benefiting from the proposed architecture, the generative ability of 3D Gaussians is enhanced, especially in structured regions. Our proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and geometric reconstruction, as evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on public datasets.

- **Summary**: Unique player identification is a fundamental module in vision-driven sports analytics. Identifying players from broadcast videos can aid with various downstream tasks such as player assessment, in-game analysis, and broadcast production. However, automatic detection of jersey numbers using deep features is challenging primarily due to: a) motion blur, b) low resolution video feed, and c) occlusions. With their recent success in various vision tasks, masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a superior alternative to conventional feature extractors. However, most MAEs simply zero-out image patches either randomly or focus on where to mask rather than how to mask. Motivated by human vision, we devise a novel domain-guided masking policy for MAEs termed d-MAE to facilitate robust feature extraction in the presence of motion blur for player identification. We further introduce a new spatio-temporal network leveraging our novel d-MAE for unique player identification. We conduct experiments on three large-scale sports datasets, including a curated baseball dataset, the SoccerNet dataset, and an in-house ice hockey dataset. We preprocess the datasets using an upgraded keyframe identification (KfID) module by focusing on frames containing jersey numbers. Additionally, we propose a keyframe-fusion technique to augment keyframes, preserving spatial and temporal context. Our spatio-temporal network showcases significant improvements, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 8.58%, 4.29%, and 1.20% in the test set accuracies, respectively. Rigorous ablations highlight the effectiveness of our domain-guided masking approach and the refined KfID module, resulting in performance enhancements of 1.48% and 1.84% respectively, compared to original architectures.

- **Summary**: We propose a deep learning based novel prediction framework for enhanced bandwidth reduction in motion transfer enabled video applications such as video conferencing, virtual reality gaming and privacy preservation for patient health monitoring. To model complex motion, we use the First Order Motion Model (FOMM) that represents dynamic objects using learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. Keypoints are extracted by a self-supervised keypoint detector and organized in a time series corresponding to the video frames. Prediction of keypoints, to enable transmission using lower frames per second on the source device, is performed using a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN). The predicted keypoints are then synthesized to video frames using an optical flow estimator and a generator network. This efficacy of leveraging keypoint based representations in conjunction with VRNN based prediction for both video animation and reconstruction is demonstrated on three diverse datasets. For real-time applications, our results show the effectiveness of our proposed architecture by enabling up to 2x additional bandwidth reduction over existing keypoint based video motion transfer frameworks without significantly compromising video quality.

- **Summary**: Since the emergence of Covid-19 in late 2019, medical image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial research area, particularly with the utility of CT-scan imaging for disease diagnosis. This paper contributes to the 4th COV19D competition, focusing on Covid-19 Detection and Covid-19 Domain Adaptation Challenges. Our approach centers on lung segmentation and Covid-19 infection segmentation employing the recent CNN-based segmentation architecture PDAtt-Unet, which simultaneously segments lung regions and infections. Departing from traditional methods, we concatenate the input slice (grayscale) with segmented lung and infection, generating three input channels akin to color channels. Additionally, we employ three 3D CNN backbones Customized Hybrid-DeCoVNet, along with pretrained 3D-Resnet-18 and 3D-Resnet-50 models to train Covid-19 recognition for both challenges. Furthermore, we explore ensemble approaches and testing augmentation to enhance performance. Comparison with baseline results underscores the substantial efficiency of our approach, with a significant margin in terms of F1-score (14 %). This study advances the field by presenting a comprehensive methodology for accurate Covid-19 detection and adaptation, leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques in medical image analysis.

- **Summary**: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the most commonly used for disease diagnosis and tumor recurrence tracking. Hematoxylin excels at highlighting nuclei, whereas eosin stains the cytoplasm. However, H&E stain lacks details for differentiating different types of cells relevant to identifying the grade of the disease or response to specific treatment variations. Pathologists require special immunohistochemical (IHC) stains that highlight different cell types. These stains help in accurately identifying different regions of disease growth and their interactions with the cell's microenvironment. The advent of deep learning models has made Image-to-Image (I2I) translation a key research area, reducing the need for expensive physical staining processes. Pix2Pix and CycleGAN are still the most commonly used methods for virtual staining applications. However, both suffer from hallucinations or staining irregularities when H&E stain has less discriminate information about the underlying cells IHC needs to highlight (e.g.,CD3 lymphocytes). Diffusion models are currently the state-of-the-art models for image generation and conditional generation tasks. However, they require extensive and diverse datasets (millions of samples) to converge, which is less feasible for virtual staining applications.Inspired by the success of multitask deep learning models for limited dataset size, we propose StainDiffuser, a novel multitask dual diffusion architecture for virtual staining that converges under a limited training budget. StainDiffuser trains two diffusion processes simultaneously: (a) generation of cell-specific IHC stain from H&E and (b) H&E-based cell segmentation using coarse segmentation only during training. Our results show that StainDiffuser produces high-quality results for easier (CK8/18,epithelial marker) and difficult stains(CD3, Lymphocytes).

- **Summary**: It is desirable to create 3D object models and 3D maps from 2D input images for applications such as navigation, virtual tourism, and urban planning. The traditional methods of creating 3D maps, (such as photogrammetry), require a large number of images and odometry. Additionally, traditional methods have difficulty with reflective surfaces and specular reflections; windows and chrome in the scene can be problematic. Google Road View is a familiar application, which uses traditional methods to fuse a collection of 2D input images into the illusion of a 3D map. However, Google Road View does not create an actual 3D object model, only a collection of views. The objective of this work is to create an actual 3D object model using updated techniques. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF[1]) has emerged as a potential solution, offering the capability to produce more precise and intricate 3D maps. Gaussian Splatting[4] is another contemporary technique. This investigation compares Neural Radiance Fields to Gaussian Splatting, and describes some of their inner workings. Our primary contribution is a method for improving the results of the 3D reconstructed models. Our results indicate that Gaussian Splatting was superior to the NeRF technique.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel system designed for 3D mapping and visual relocalization using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our proposed method uses LiDAR and camera data to create accurate and visually plausible representations of the environment. By leveraging LiDAR data to initiate the training of the 3D Gaussian Splatting map, our system constructs maps that are both detailed and geometrically accurate. To mitigate excessive GPU memory usage and facilitate rapid spatial queries, we employ a combination of a 2D voxel map and a KD-tree. This preparation makes our method well-suited for visual localization tasks, enabling efficient identification of correspondences between the query image and the rendered image from the Gaussian Splatting map via normalized cross-correlation (NCC). Additionally, we refine the camera pose of the query image using feature-based matching and the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. The effectiveness, adaptability, and precision of our system are demonstrated through extensive evaluation on the KITTI360 dataset.

- **Summary**: The assumption of a static environment is common in many geometric computer vision tasks like SLAM but limits their applicability in highly dynamic scenes. Since these tasks rely on identifying point correspondences between input images within the static part of the environment, we propose a graph neural network-based sparse feature matching network designed to perform robust matching under challenging conditions while excluding keypoints on moving objects. We employ a similar scheme of attentional aggregation over graph edges to enhance keypoint representations as state-of-the-art feature-matching networks but augment the graph with epipolar and temporal information and vastly reduce the number of graph edges. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised training scheme to extract pseudo labels for image pairs in dynamic environments from exclusively unprocessed visual-inertial data. A series of experiments show the superior performance of our network as it excludes keypoints on moving objects compared to state-of-the-art feature matching networks while still achieving similar results regarding conventional matching metrics. When integrated into a SLAM system, our network significantly improves performance, especially in highly dynamic scenes.

- **Summary**: Current LiDAR-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) multi-agent perception systems have shown the significant success on 3D object detection. While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the real-world domain gap. In this paper, we propose a domain generalization approach, named V2X-DGW, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Not only in the clean weather does our research aim to ensure favorable multi-agent performance, but also in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To advance research in this area, we have simulated the impact of three prevalent adverse weather conditions on two widely-used multi-agent datasets, resulting in the creation of two novel benchmark datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w.   To this end, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved improvements in the unseen adverse weather conditions.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained large multi-modal models (LMMs) exploit fine-tuning to adapt diverse user applications. Nevertheless, fine-tuning may face challenges due to deactivated sensors (e.g., cameras turned off for privacy or technical issues), yielding modality-incomplete data and leading to inconsistency in training data and the data for inference. Additionally, continuous training leads to catastrophic forgetting, diluting the knowledge in pre-trained LMMs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel task, Continual Missing Modality Learning (CMML), to investigate how models can generalize when data of certain modalities is missing during continual fine-tuning. Our preliminary benchmarks reveal that existing methods suffer from a significant performance drop in CMML, even with the aid of advanced continual learning techniques. Therefore, we devise a framework termed Reconstruct before Query (RebQ). It decomposes prompts into modality-specific ones and breaks them into components stored in pools accessible via a key-query mechanism, which facilitates ParameterEfficient Fine-Tuning and enhances knowledge transferability for subsequent tasks. Meanwhile, our RebQ leverages extensive multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained LMMs to reconstruct the data of missing modality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RebQ effectively reconstructs the missing modality information and retains pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, compared with the baseline, RebQ improves average precision from 20.00 to 50.92 and decreases average forgetting from 75.95 to 8.56.

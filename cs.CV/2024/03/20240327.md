- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel approach to online embedding of multi-scale CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) features into 3D maps. By harnessing CLIP, this methodology surpasses the constraints of conventional vocabulary-limited methods and enables the incorporation of semantic information into the resultant maps. While recent approaches have explored the embedding of multi-modal features in maps, they often impose significant computational costs, lacking practicality for exploring unfamiliar environments in real time. Our approach tackles these challenges by efficiently computing and embedding multi-scale CLIP features, thereby facilitating the exploration of unfamiliar environments through real-time map generation. Moreover, the embedding CLIP features into the resultant maps makes offline retrieval via linguistic queries feasible. In essence, our approach simultaneously achieves real-time object search and mapping of unfamiliar environments. Additionally, we propose a zero-shot object-goal navigation system based on our mapping approach, and we validate its efficacy through object-goal navigation, offline object retrieval, and multi-object-goal navigation in both simulated environments and real robot experiments. The findings demonstrate that our method not only exhibits swifter performance than state-of-the-art mapping methods but also surpasses them in terms of the success rate of object-goal navigation tasks.

- **Summary**: Detecting and segmenting polyps is crucial for expediting the diagnosis of colon cancer. This is a challenging task due to the large variations of polyps in color, texture, and lighting conditions, along with subtle differences between the polyp and its surrounding area. Recently, vision Transformers have shown robust abilities in modeling global context for polyp segmentation. However, they face two major limitations: the inability to learn local relations among multi-level layers and inadequate feature aggregation in the decoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel decoder architecture aimed at hierarchically aggregating locally enhanced multi-level dense features. Specifically, we introduce a novel module named Dense Attention Gate (DAG), which adaptively fuses all previous layers' features to establish local feature relations among all layers. Furthermore, we propose a novel nested decoder architecture that hierarchically aggregates decoder features, thereby enhancing semantic features. We incorporate our novel dense decoder with the PVT backbone network and conduct evaluations on five polyp segmentation datasets: Kvasir, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, and ETIS. Our experiments and comparisons with nine competing segmentation models demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the previous models on four datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present a method for large-mask pluralistic image inpainting based on the generative framework of discrete latent codes. Our method learns latent priors, discretized as tokens, by only performing computations at the visible locations of the image. This is realized by a restrictive partial encoder that predicts the token label for each visible block, a bidirectional transformer that infers the missing labels by only looking at these tokens, and a dedicated synthesis network that couples the tokens with the partial image priors to generate coherent and pluralistic complete image even under extreme mask settings. Experiments on public benchmarks validate our design choices as the proposed method outperforms strong baselines in both visual quality and diversity metrics.

- **Summary**: Finding a suitable layout represents a crucial task for diverse applications in graphic design. Motivated by simpler and smoother sampling trajectories, we explore the use of Flow Matching as an alternative to current diffusion-based layout generation models. Specifically, we propose LayoutFlow, an efficient flow-based model capable of generating high-quality layouts. Instead of progressively denoising the elements of a noisy layout, our method learns to gradually move, or flow, the elements of an initial sample until it reaches its final prediction. In addition, we employ a conditioning scheme that allows us to handle various generation tasks with varying degrees of conditioning with a single model. Empirically, LayoutFlow performs on par with state-of-the-art models while being significantly faster.

- **Summary**: RGB-T tracking, a vital downstream task of object tracking, has made remarkable progress in recent years. Yet, it remains hindered by two major challenges: 1) the trade-off between performance and efficiency; 2) the scarcity of training data. To address the latter challenge, some recent methods employ prompts to fine-tune pre-trained RGB tracking models and leverage upstream knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner. However, these methods inadequately explore modality-independent patterns and disregard the dynamic reliability of different modalities in open scenarios. We propose M3PT, a novel RGB-T prompt tracking method that leverages middle fusion and multi-modal and multi-stage visual prompts to overcome these challenges. We pioneer the use of the middle fusion framework for RGB-T tracking, which achieves a balance between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the pre-trained RGB tracking model into the framework and utilize multiple flexible prompt strategies to adapt the pre-trained model to the comprehensive exploration of uni-modal patterns and the improved modeling of fusion-modal features, harnessing the potential of prompt learning in RGB-T tracking. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four challenging benchmarks, while attaining 46.1 fps inference speed.

- **Summary**: There has been significant progress in implementing deep learning models in disease diagnosis using chest X- rays. Despite these advancements, inherent biases in these models can lead to disparities in prediction accuracy across protected groups. In this study, we propose a framework to achieve accurate diagnostic outcomes and ensure fairness across intersectional groups in high-dimensional chest X- ray multi-label classification. Transcending traditional protected attributes, we consider complex interactions within social determinants, enabling a more granular benchmark and evaluation of fairness. We present a simple and robust method that involves retraining the last classification layer of pre-trained models using a balanced dataset across groups. Additionally, we account for fairness constraints and integrate class-balanced fine-tuning for multi-label settings. The evaluation of our method on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an optimal tradeoff between accuracy and fairness compared to baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Rapid advancements in medical image segmentation performance have been significantly driven by the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, these models introduce high computational demands and often have limited ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging datasets. In this manuscript, we introduce Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS), a novel approach leveraging a generative model for image segmentation. Concretely, GMS employs a robust pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to derive latent representations of both images and masks, followed by a mapping model that learns the transition from image to mask in the latent space. This process culminates in generating a precise segmentation mask within the image space using the pre-trained VAE decoder. The design of GMS leads to fewer learnable parameters in the model, resulting in a reduced computational burden and enhanced generalization capability. Our extensive experimental analysis across five public datasets in different medical imaging domains demonstrates GMS outperforms existing discriminative segmentation models and has remarkable domain generalization. Our experiments suggest GMS could set a new benchmark for medical image segmentation, offering a scalable and effective solution.

- **Summary**: Detecting anomaly patterns from images is a crucial artificial intelligence technique in industrial applications. Recent research in this domain has emphasized the necessity of a large volume of training data, overlooking the practical scenario where, post-deployment of the model, unlabeled data containing both normal and abnormal samples can be utilized to enhance the model's performance. Consequently, this paper focuses on addressing the challenging yet practical few-shot online anomaly detection and segmentation (FOADS) task. Under the FOADS framework, models are trained on a few-shot normal dataset, followed by inspection and improvement of their capabilities by leveraging unlabeled streaming data containing both normal and abnormal samples simultaneously.   To tackle this issue, we propose modeling the feature distribution of normal images using a Neural Gas network, which offers the flexibility to adapt the topology structure to identify outliers in the data flow. In order to achieve improved performance with limited training samples, we employ multi-scale feature embedding extracted from a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet to obtain a robust representation. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm that can incrementally update parameters without the need to store previous samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve substantial performance under the FOADS setting, while ensuring that the time complexity remains within an acceptable range on MVTec AD and BTAD datasets.

- **Summary**: The detection of unknown traffic obstacles is vital to ensure safe autonomous driving. The standard object-detection methods cannot identify unknown objects that are not included under predefined categories. This is because object-detection methods are trained to assign a background label to pixels corresponding to the presence of unknown objects. To address this problem, the pixel-wise anomaly-detection approach has attracted increased research attention. Anomaly-detection techniques, such as uncertainty estimation and perceptual difference from reconstructed images, make it possible to identify pixels of unknown objects as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. However, when applied to images with many unknowns and complex components, such as driving scenes, these methods often exhibit unstable performance. The purpose of this study is to achieve stable performance for detecting unknown objects by incorporating the object-detection fashions into the pixel-wise anomaly detection methods. To achieve this goal, we adopt a semantic-segmentation network with a sigmoid head that simultaneously provides pixel-wise anomaly scores and objectness scores. Our experimental results show that the objectness scores play an important role in improving the detection performance. Based on these results, we propose a novel anomaly score by integrating these two scores, which we term as unknown objectness score. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to the publicly available datasets.

- **Summary**: Hand gesture recognition (HGR) based on multimodal data has attracted considerable attention owing to its great potential in applications. Various manually designed multimodal deep networks have performed well in multimodal HGR (MHGR), but most of existing algorithms require a lot of expert experience and time-consuming manual trials. To address these issues, we propose an evolutionary network architecture search framework with the adaptive multimodel fusion (AMF-ENAS). Specifically, we design an encoding space that simultaneously considers fusion positions and ratios of the multimodal data, allowing for the automatic construction of multimodal networks with different architectures through decoding. Additionally, we consider three input streams corresponding to intra-modal surface electromyography (sEMG), intra-modal accelerometer (ACC), and inter-modal sEMG-ACC. To automatically adapt to various datasets, the ENAS framework is designed to automatically search a MHGR network with appropriate fusion positions and ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that ENAS has been utilized in MHGR to tackle issues related to the fusion position and ratio of multimodal data. Experimental results demonstrate that AMF-ENAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Ninapro DB2, DB3, and DB7 datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent fMRI-to-image approaches mainly focused on associating fMRI signals with specific conditions of pre-trained diffusion models. These approaches, while producing high-quality images, capture only a limited aspect of the complex information in fMRI signals and offer little detailed control over image creation. In contrast, this paper proposes to directly modulate the generation process of diffusion models using fMRI signals. Our approach, NeuroPictor, divides the fMRI-to-image process into three steps: i) fMRI calibrated-encoding, to tackle multi-individual pre-training for a shared latent space to minimize individual difference and enable the subsequent cross-subject training; ii) fMRI-to-image cross-subject pre-training, perceptually learning to guide diffusion model with high- and low-level conditions across different individuals; iii) fMRI-to-image single-subject refining, similar with step ii but focus on adapting to particular individual. NeuroPictor extracts high-level semantic features from fMRI signals that characterizing the visual stimulus and incrementally fine-tunes the diffusion model with a low-level manipulation network to provide precise structural instructions. By training with over 60,000 fMRI-image pairs from various individuals, our model enjoys superior fMRI-to-image decoding capacity, particularly in the within-subject setting, as evidenced in benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Energy-efficient spikformer has been proposed by integrating the biologically plausible spiking neural network (SNN) and artificial Transformer, whereby the Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) is used to achieve both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. However, it seems that self-attention is not always necessary, especially in sparse spike-form calculation manners. In this paper, we innovatively replace vanilla SSA (using dynamic bases calculating from Query and Key) with spike-form Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, and their combinations (using fixed triangular or wavelets bases), based on a key hypothesis that both of them use a set of basis functions for information transformation. Hence, the Fourier-or-Wavelet-based spikformer (FWformer) is proposed and verified in visual classification tasks, including both static image and event-based video datasets. The FWformer can achieve comparable or even higher accuracies ($0.4\%$-$1.5\%$), higher running speed ($9\%$-$51\%$ for training and $19\%$-$70\%$ for inference), reduced theoretical energy consumption ($20\%$-$25\%$), and reduced GPU memory usage ($4\%$-$26\%$), compared to the standard spikformer. Our result indicates the continuous refinement of new Transformers, that are inspired either by biological discovery (spike-form), or information theory (Fourier or Wavelet Transform), is promising.

- **Summary**: PURPOSE: Deep learning methods for classifying prostate cancer (PCa) in ultrasound images typically employ convolutional networks (CNNs) to detect cancer in small regions of interest (ROI) along a needle trace region. However, this approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth histopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs. Recently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by combining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to detect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In this work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer architectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a comparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based prostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning strategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label noise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer classification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier with MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning strategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that for both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones lag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more noticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can improve performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a specificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for modelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust features than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the best architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an effective way to improve performance.

- **Summary**: As drone technology advances, using unmanned aerial vehicles for aerial surveys has become the dominant trend in modern low-altitude remote sensing. The surge in aerial video data necessitates accurate prediction for future scenarios and motion states of the interested target, particularly in applications like traffic management and disaster response. Existing video prediction methods focus solely on predicting future scenes (video frames), suffering from the neglect of explicitly modeling target's motion states, which is crucial for aerial video interpretation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task called Target-Aware Aerial Video Prediction, aiming to simultaneously predict future scenes and motion states of the target. Further, we design a model specifically for this task, named TAFormer, which provides a unified modeling approach for both video and target motion states. Specifically, we introduce Spatiotemporal Attention (STA), which decouples the learning of video dynamics into spatial static attention and temporal dynamic attention, effectively modeling the scene appearance and motion. Additionally, we design an Information Sharing Mechanism (ISM), which elegantly unifies the modeling of video and target motion by facilitating information interaction through two sets of messenger tokens. Moreover, to alleviate the difficulty of distinguishing targets in blurry predictions, we introduce Target-Sensitive Gaussian Loss (TSGL), enhancing the model's sensitivity to both target's position and content. Extensive experiments on UAV123VP and VisDroneVP (derived from single-object tracking datasets) demonstrate the exceptional performance of TAFormer in target-aware video prediction, showcasing its adaptability to the additional requirements of aerial video interpretation for target awareness.

- **Summary**: 3D shape generation aims to produce innovative 3D content adhering to specific conditions and constraints. Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.

- **Summary**: Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision, evolving from supervised learning with human-annotated labels to aligning image-text pairs from the Internet. Despite recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), the visual representations they rely on, such as CLIP embeddings, often lack access to external world knowledge critical for real-world visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel visual representation tailored for MLLMs. It provides hierarchical text descriptions of holistic visual scenes, consisting of a scene description and multiple object-centric descriptions that encompass categories, attributes, and knowledge at instance level. We further develop a scalable generator for visual table generation and train it on small-scale annotations from GPT4V. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, with generated visual tables as additional visual representations, our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs across diverse benchmarks. When visual tables serve as standalone visual representations, our model can closely match or even beat the SOTA MLLMs that are built on CLIP visual embeddings.

- **Summary**: This study presents a novel approach to Generative Class Incremental Learning (GCIL) by introducing the forgetting mechanism, aimed at dynamically managing class information for better adaptation to streaming data. GCIL is one of the hot topics in the field of computer vision, and this is considered one of the crucial tasks in society, specifically the continual learning of generative models. The ability to forget is a crucial brain function that facilitates continual learning by selectively discarding less relevant information for humans. However, in the field of machine learning models, the concept of intentionally forgetting has not been extensively investigated. In this study we aim to bridge this gap by incorporating the forgetting mechanisms into GCIL, thereby examining their impact on the models' ability to learn in continual learning. Through our experiments, we have found that integrating the forgetting mechanisms significantly enhances the models' performance in acquiring new knowledge, underscoring the positive role that strategic forgetting plays in the process of continual learning.

- **Summary**: Recent Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have demonstrated significant advancements. Nevertheless, these models heavily rely on image-text pairs that capture only coarse and global information of an image, leading to a limitation in their regional understanding ability. In this work, we introduce \textbf{RegionVLM}, equipped with explicit regional modeling capabilities, allowing them to understand user-indicated image regions. To achieve this, we design a simple yet innovative architecture, requiring no modifications to the model architecture or objective function. Additionally, we leverage a dataset that contains a novel source of information, namely Localized Narratives, which has been overlooked in previous VLP research. Our experiments demonstrate that our single generalist model not only achieves an interactive dialogue system but also exhibits superior performance on various zero-shot region understanding tasks, without compromising its ability for global image understanding.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for deriving general representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data. However, as real-world applications continually integrate new content, the high computational and resource demands of SSL necessitate continual learning rather than complete retraining. This poses a challenge in striking a balance between stability and plasticity when adapting to new information. In this paper, we employ Centered Kernel Alignment for quantitatively analyzing model stability and plasticity, revealing the critical roles of batch normalization layers for stability and convolutional layers for plasticity. Motivated by this, we propose Branch-tuning, an efficient and straightforward method that achieves a balance between stability and plasticity in continual SSL. Branch-tuning consists of branch expansion and compression, and can be easily applied to various SSL methods without the need of modifying the original methods, retaining old data or models. We validate our method through incremental experiments on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical value in real-world scenarios. We hope our work offers new insights for future continual self-supervised learning research. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: The quality of images captured outdoors is often affected by the weather. One factor that interferes with sight is rain, which can obstruct the view of observers and computer vision applications that rely on those images. The work aims to recover rain images by removing rain streaks via Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) for image deraining (SRL-Derain). We locate rain streak pixels from the input rain image via dictionary learning and use pixel-wise RL agents to take multiple inpainting actions to remove rain progressively. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt where self-supervised RL is applied to image deraining. Experimental results on several benchmark image-deraining datasets show that the proposed SRL-Derain performs favorably against state-of-the-art few-shot and self-supervised deraining and denoising methods.

- **Summary**: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered significant attention for its versatile segmentation abilities and intuitive prompt-based interface. However, its application in medical imaging presents challenges, requiring either substantial training costs and extensive medical datasets for full model fine-tuning or high-quality prompts for optimal performance. This paper introduces H-SAM: a prompt-free adaptation of SAM tailored for efficient fine-tuning of medical images via a two-stage hierarchical decoding procedure. In the initial stage, H-SAM employs SAM's original decoder to generate a prior probabilistic mask, guiding a more intricate decoding process in the second stage. Specifically, we propose two key designs: 1) A class-balanced, mask-guided self-attention mechanism addressing the unbalanced label distribution, enhancing image embedding; 2) A learnable mask cross-attention mechanism spatially modulating the interplay among different image regions based on the prior mask. Moreover, the inclusion of a hierarchical pixel decoder in H-SAM enhances its proficiency in capturing fine-grained and localized details. This approach enables SAM to effectively integrate learned medical priors, facilitating enhanced adaptation for medical image segmentation with limited samples. Our H-SAM demonstrates a 4.78% improvement in average Dice compared to existing prompt-free SAM variants for multi-organ segmentation using only 10% of 2D slices. Notably, without using any unlabeled data, H-SAM even outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised models relying on extensive unlabeled training data across various medical datasets.

- **Summary**: Information inside visual and LiDAR data is well complementary derived from the fine-grained texture of images and massive geometric information in point clouds. However, it remains challenging to explore effective visual-LiDAR fusion, mainly due to the intrinsic data structure inconsistency between two modalities: Images are regular and dense, but LiDAR points are unordered and sparse. To address the problem, we propose a local-to-global fusion network with bi-directional structure alignment. To obtain locally fused features, we project points onto image plane as cluster centers and cluster image pixels around each center. Image pixels are pre-organized as pseudo points for image-to-point structure alignment. Then, we convert points to pseudo images by cylindrical projection (point-to-image structure alignment) and perform adaptive global feature fusion between point features with local fused features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI odometry and FlyingThings3D scene flow datasets compared to both single-modal and multi-modal methods. Codes will be released later.

- **Summary**: State-of-the-art (SOTA) hierarchical localisation pipelines (HLoc) rely on image retrieval (IR) techniques to establish 2D-3D correspondences by selecting the $k$ most similar images from a reference image database for a given query image. Although higher values of $k$ enhance localisation robustness, the computational cost for feature matching increases linearly with $k$. In this paper, we observe that queries that are the most similar to images in the database result in a higher proportion of feature matches and, thus, more accurate positioning. Thus, a small number of images is sufficient for queries very similar to images in the reference database. We then propose a novel approach, AIR-HLoc, which divides query images into different localisation difficulty levels based on their similarity to the reference image database. We consider an image with high similarity to the reference image as an easy query and an image with low similarity as a hard query. Easy queries show a limited improvement in accuracy when increasing $k$. Conversely, higher values of $k$ significantly improve accuracy for hard queries. Given the limited improvement in accuracy when increasing $k$ for easy queries and the significant improvement for hard queries, we adapt the value of $k$ to the query's difficulty level. Therefore, AIR-HLoc optimizes processing time by adaptively assigning different values of $k$ based on the similarity between the query and reference images without losing accuracy. Our extensive experiments on the Cambridge Landmarks, 7Scenes, and Aachen Day-Night-v1.1 datasets demonstrate our algorithm's efficacy, reducing 30\%, 26\%, and 11\% in computational overhead while maintaining SOTA accuracy compared to HLoc with fixed image retrieval.

- **Summary**: The spatial attention mechanism has been widely used to improve object detection performance. However, its operation is currently limited to static convolutions lacking content-adaptive features. This paper innovatively approaches from the perspective of dynamic convolution. We propose Razor Dynamic Convolution (RDConv) to address thetwo flaws in dynamic weight convolution, making it hard to implement in spatial mechanism: 1) it is computation-heavy; 2) when generating weights, spatial information is disregarded. Firstly, by using Razor Operation to generate certain features, we vastly reduce the parameters of the entire dynamic convolution operation. Secondly, we added a spatial branch inside RDConv to generate convolutional kernel parameters with richer spatial information. Embedding dynamic convolution will also bring the problem of sensitivity to high-frequency noise. We propose the Static-Guided Dynamic Module (SGDM) to address this limitation. By using SGDM, we utilize a set of asymmetric static convolution kernel parameters to guide the construction of dynamic convolution. We introduce the mechanism of shared weights in static convolution to solve the problem of dynamic convolution being sensitive to high-frequency noise. Extensive experiments illustrate that multiple different object detection backbones equipped with SGDM achieve a highly competitive boost in performance(e.g., +4% mAP with YOLOv5n on VOC and +1.7% mAP with YOLOv8n on COCO) with negligible parameter increase(i.e., +0.33M on YOLOv5n and +0.19M on YOLOv8n).

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well in close-world scenarios. However, novel classes emerged continually in real applications, making it necessary to learn incrementally. Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to gradually recognize new classes while maintaining the discriminability of old ones. Existing CIL methods have two limitations: a heavy reliance on preserving old data for forgetting mitigation and the need for vast labeled data for knowledge adaptation. To overcome these issues, we propose a non-exemplar semi-supervised CIL framework with contrastive learning and semi-supervised incremental prototype classifier (Semi-IPC). On the one hand, contrastive learning helps the model learn rich representations, easing the trade-off between learning representations of new classes and forgetting that of old classes. On the other hand, Semi-IPC learns a prototype for each class with unsupervised regularization, enabling the model to incrementally learn from partially labeled new data while maintaining the knowledge of old classes. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the strong performance of our method: without storing any old samples and only using less than 1% of labels, Semi-IPC outperforms advanced exemplar-based methods. We hope our work offers new insights for future CIL research. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has attracted increasing attention for tackling distribution shifts during the test time. Though prior studies have achieved very promising performance, they involve intensive computation which is severely unaligned with test-time adaptation. We design TDA, a training-free dynamic adapter that enables effective and efficient test-time adaptation with vision-language models. TDA works with a lightweight key-value cache that maintains a dynamic queue with few-shot pseudo labels as values and the corresponding test-sample features as keys. Leveraging the key-value cache, TDA allows adapting to test data gradually via progressive pseudo label refinement which is super-efficient without incurring any backpropagation. In addition, we introduce negative pseudo labeling that alleviates the adverse impact of pseudo label noises by assigning pseudo labels to certain negative classes when the model is uncertain about its pseudo label predictions. Extensive experiments over two benchmarks demonstrate TDA's superior effectiveness and efficiency as compared with the state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced significantly in visual representation learning and recognition. However, they face notable challenges in performance and computational efficiency when dealing with real-world, multi-scale image inputs. Conventional methods rescale all input images into a fixed size, wherein a larger fixed size favors performance but rescaling small size images to a larger size incurs digitization noise and increased computation cost. In this work, we carry out a comprehensive, layer-wise investigation of CNN models in response to scale variation, based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) analysis. The observations reveal lower layers are more sensitive to input image scale variations than high-level layers. Inspired by this insight, we propose Multi-scale Unified Network (MUSN) consisting of multi-scale subnets, a unified network, and scale-invariant constraint. Our method divides the shallow layers into multi-scale subnets to enable feature extraction from multi-scale inputs, and the low-level features are unified in deep layers for extracting high-level semantic features. A scale-invariant constraint is posed to maintain feature consistency across different scales. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and other scale-diverse datasets, demonstrate that MSUN achieves significant improvements in both model performance and computational efficiency. Particularly, MSUN yields an accuracy increase up to 44.53% and diminishes FLOPs by 7.01-16.13% in multi-scale scenarios.

- **Summary**: The rise in internet usage has led to the generation of massive amounts of data, resulting in the adoption of various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms, which can effectively utilize the colossal amount of data to train models. However, before deploying these models in the real world, these must be strictly evaluated on performance measures like worst-case recall and satisfy constraints such as fairness. We find that current state-of-the-art empirical techniques offer sub-optimal performance on these practical, non-decomposable performance objectives. On the other hand, the theoretical techniques necessitate training a new model from scratch for each performance objective. To bridge the gap, we propose SelMix, a selective mixup-based inexpensive fine-tuning technique for pre-trained models, to optimize for the desired objective. The core idea of our framework is to determine a sampling distribution to perform a mixup of features between samples from particular classes such that it optimizes the given objective. We comprehensively evaluate our technique against the existing empirical and theoretically principled methods on standard benchmark datasets for imbalanced classification. We find that proposed SelMix fine-tuning significantly improves the performance for various practical non-decomposable objectives across benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks have demonstrated the vulnerability of Machine Learning (ML) image classifiers in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems. An adversarial attack can deceive the classifier into making incorrect predictions by perturbing the input SAR images, for example, with a few scatterers attached to the on-ground objects. Therefore, it is critical to develop robust SAR ATR systems that can detect potential adversarial attacks by leveraging the inherent uncertainty in ML classifiers, thereby effectively alerting human decision-makers. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware SAR ATR for detecting adversarial attacks. Specifically, we leverage the capability of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) in performing image classification with quantified epistemic uncertainty to measure the confidence for each input SAR image. By evaluating the uncertainty, our method alerts when the input SAR image is likely to be adversarially generated. Simultaneously, we also generate visual explanations that reveal the specific regions in the SAR image where the adversarial scatterers are likely to to be present, thus aiding human decision-making with hints of evidence of adversarial attacks. Experiments on the MSTAR dataset demonstrate that our approach can identify over 80% adversarial SAR images with fewer than 20% false alarms, and our visual explanations can identify up to over 90% of scatterers in an adversarial SAR image.

- **Summary**: Dimensionality reduction represents a critical preprocessing step in order to increase the efficiency and the performance of many hyperspectral imaging algorithms. However, dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), suffer from their computationally demanding nature, becoming advisable for their implementation onto high-performance computer architectures for applications under strict latency constraints. This work presents the implementation of the PCA algorithm onto two different high-performance devices, namely, an NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a Kalray manycore, uncovering a highly valuable set of tips and tricks in order to take full advantage of the inherent parallelism of these high-performance computing platforms, and hence, reducing the time that is required to process a given hyperspectral image. Moreover, the achieved results obtained with different hyperspectral images have been compared with the ones that were obtained with a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementation of the PCA algorithm that has been recently published, providing, for the first time in the literature, a comprehensive analysis in order to highlight the pros and cons of each option.

- **Summary**: Information from neuroimaging examinations (CT, MRI) is increasingly used to support diagnoses of dementia, e.g., Alzheimer's disease. While current clinical practice is mainly based on visual inspection and feature engineering, Deep Learning approaches can be used to automate the analysis and to discover new image-biomarkers. Part-prototype neural networks (PP-NN) are an alternative to standard blackbox models, and have shown promising results in general computer vision. PP-NN's base their reasoning on prototypical image regions that are learned fully unsupervised, and combined with a simple-to-understand decision layer. We present PIPNet3D, a PP-NN for volumetric images. We apply PIPNet3D to the clinical case study of Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis from structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI). We assess the quality of prototypes under a systematic evaluation framework, propose new metrics to evaluate brain prototypes and perform an evaluation with domain experts. Our results show that PIPNet3D is an interpretable, compact model for Alzheimer's diagnosis with its reasoning well aligned to medical domain knowledge. Notably, PIPNet3D achieves the same accuracy as its blackbox counterpart; and removing the remaining clinically irrelevant prototypes from its decision process does not decrease predictive performance.

- **Summary**: Event-based object detection has recently garnered attention in the computer vision community due to the exceptional properties of event cameras, such as high dynamic range and no motion blur. However, feature asynchronism and sparsity cause invisible objects due to no relative motion to the camera, posing a significant challenge in the task. Prior works have studied various memory mechanisms to preserve as many features as possible at the current time, guided by temporal clues. While these implicit-learned memories retain some short-term information, they still struggle to preserve long-term features effectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as pseudo-occluded objects and aim to reveal their features. Firstly, we introduce visibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to append additional visibility labels on an existing event camera dataset. Secondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to maintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features have not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated as an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the displacements of objects across frames. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal feature aggregation module to enrich the latent features and a consistency loss to increase the robustness of the overall pipeline. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify our method's effectiveness where still objects are retained but real occluded objects are discarded. The results demonstrate that (1) the additional visibility labels can assist in supervised training, and (2) our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a significant improvement of 7.9% absolute mAP.

- **Summary**: The diverse and high-quality content generated by recent generative models demonstrates the great potential of using synthetic data to train downstream models. However, in vision, especially in objection detection, related areas are not fully explored, the synthetic images are merely used to balance the long tails of existing datasets, and the accuracy of the generated labels is low, the full potential of generative models has not been exploited. In this paper, we propose DODA, a data synthesizer that can generate high-quality object detection data for new domains in agriculture. Specifically, we improve the controllability of layout-to-image through encoding layout as an image, thereby improving the quality of labels, and use a visual encoder to provide visual clues for the diffusion model to decouple visual features from the diffusion model, and empowering the model the ability to generate data in new domains. On the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) Dataset, which is the largest dataset in agriculture and contains diverse domains, using the data synthesized by DODA improves the performance of the object detector by 12.74-17.76 AP$_{50}$ in the domain that was significantly shifted from the training data.

- **Summary**: Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) imaging is routinely used in cancer diagnosis and prognosis by providing complementary information. Automatically segmenting tumors in PET/CT images can significantly improve examination efficiency. Traditional multi-modal segmentation solutions mainly rely on concatenation operations for modality fusion, which fail to effectively model the non-linear dependencies between PET and CT modalities. Recent studies have investigated various approaches to optimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint representations. However, modality-specific encoders used in these methods operate independently, inadequately leveraging the synergistic relationships inherent in PET and CT modalities, for example, the complementarity between semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Interaction and Weighting Network termed H2ASeg to explore the intrinsic cross-modal correlations and transfer potential complementary information. Specifically, we design a Modality-Cooperative Spatial Attention (MCSA) module that performs intra- and inter-modal interactions globally and locally. Additionally, a Target-Aware Modality Weighting (TAMW) module is developed to highlight tumor-related features within multi-modal features, thereby refining tumor segmentation. By embedding these modules across different layers, H2ASeg can hierarchically model cross-modal correlations, enabling a nuanced understanding of both semantic and structural tumor features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of H2ASeg, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on AutoPet-II and Hecktor2022 benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Colorizing line art is a pivotal task in the production of hand-drawn cel animation. This typically involves digital painters using a paint bucket tool to manually color each segment enclosed by lines, based on RGB values predetermined by a color designer. This frame-by-frame process is both arduous and time-intensive. Current automated methods mainly focus on segment matching. This technique migrates colors from a reference to the target frame by aligning features within line-enclosed segments across frames. However, issues like occlusion and wrinkles in animations often disrupt these direct correspondences, leading to mismatches. In this work, we introduce a new learning-based inclusion matching pipeline, which directs the network to comprehend the inclusion relationships between segments rather than relying solely on direct visual correspondences. Our method features a two-stage pipeline that integrates a coarse color warping module with an inclusion matching module, enabling more nuanced and accurate colorization. To facilitate the training of our network, we also develope a unique dataset, referred to as PaintBucket-Character. This dataset includes rendered line arts alongside their colorized counterparts, featuring various 3D characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing techniques.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities, MLLMs often suffer from an over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers in complex multimodal tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within our framework, we devise a causal graph to elucidate the predictions of MLLMs on VQA problems, and assess the causal effect of biases through an in-depth causal analysis. Motivated by the causal graph, we introduce a novel MORE dataset, consisting of 12,000 VQA instances. This dataset is designed to challenge MLLMs' abilities, necessitating multi-hop reasoning and the surmounting of unimodal biases. Furthermore, we propose two strategies to mitigate unimodal biases and enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, including a Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA) framework for limited-access MLLMs and the refinement of open-source MLLMs through fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments offer valuable insights for future research. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/MORE.

- **Summary**: The detection and analysis of the solar coronal holes (CHs) is an important field of study in the domain of solar physics. Mainly, it is required for the proper prediction of the geomagnetic storms which directly or indirectly affect various space and ground-based systems. For the detection of CHs till date, the solar scientist depends on manual hand-drawn approaches. However, with the advancement of image processing technologies, some automated image segmentation methods have been used for the detection of CHs. In-spite of this, fast and accurate detection of CHs are till a major issues. Here in this work, a novel quantum computing-based fast fuzzy c-mean technique has been developed for fast detection of the CHs region. The task has been carried out in two stages, in first stage the solar image has been segmented using a quantum computing based fast fuzzy c-mean (QCFFCM) and in the later stage the CHs has been extracted out from the segmented image based on image morphological operation. In the work, quantum computing has been used to optimize the cost function of the fast fuzzy c-mean (FFCM) algorithm, where quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has been used to optimize the quadratic part of the cost function. The proposed method has been tested for 193 \AA{} SDO/AIA full-disk solar image datasets and has been compared with the existing techniques. The outcome shows the comparable performance of the proposed method with the existing one within a very lesser time.

- **Summary**: We present a specialized procedural model for generating synthetic agricultural scenes, focusing on soybean crops, along with various weeds. This model is capable of simulating distinct growth stages of these plants, diverse soil conditions, and randomized field arrangements under varying lighting conditions. The integration of real-world textures and environmental factors into the procedural generation process enhances the photorealism and applicability of the synthetic data. Our dataset includes 12,000 images with semantic labels, offering a comprehensive resource for computer vision tasks in precision agriculture, such as semantic segmentation for autonomous weed control. We validate our model's effectiveness by comparing the synthetic data against real agricultural images, demonstrating its potential to significantly augment training data for machine learning models in agriculture. This approach not only provides a cost-effective solution for generating high-quality, diverse data but also addresses specific needs in agricultural vision tasks that are not fully covered by general-purpose models.

- **Summary**: Undoubtedly, high-fidelity 3D hair is crucial for achieving realism, artistic expression, and immersion in computer graphics. While existing 3D hair modeling methods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving high-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture conditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned prior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these challenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity hair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for environments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main stages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The exterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization (PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from multiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior 3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates the inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a data-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D structural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the synthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges the domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we generate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair growth algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits robustness across diverse hairstyles and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Most domain adaptation (DA) methods are based on either a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or a vision transformers (ViTs). They align the distribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their unique characteristics. For instance, ViT excels in accuracy due to its superior ability to capture global representations, while CNN has an advantage in capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid method to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly Class-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their distinct strengths. In particular, we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly find class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between the outputs of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source support. In contrast, the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the previously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy between the probabilities of the two classifiers. Finally, ViT and CNN mutually exchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the knowledge discrepancies of these models. Compared to conventional DA methods, our ECB achieves superior performance, which verifies its effectiveness in this hybrid model.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles a significant challenge faced by Vision Transformers (ViTs): their constrained scalability across different image resolutions. Typically, ViTs experience a performance decline when processing resolutions different from those seen during training. Our work introduces two key innovations to address this issue. Firstly, we propose a novel module for dynamic resolution adjustment, designed with a single Transformer block, specifically to achieve highly efficient incremental token integration. Secondly, we introduce fuzzy positional encoding in the Vision Transformer to provide consistent positional awareness across multiple resolutions, thereby preventing overfitting to any single training resolution. Our resulting model, ViTAR (Vision Transformer with Any Resolution), demonstrates impressive adaptability, achieving 83.3\% top-1 accuracy at a 1120x1120 resolution and 80.4\% accuracy at a 4032x4032 resolution, all while reducing computational costs. ViTAR also shows strong performance in downstream tasks such as instance and semantic segmentation and can easily combined with self-supervised learning techniques like Masked AutoEncoder. Our work provides a cost-effective solution for enhancing the resolution scalability of ViTs, paving the way for more versatile and efficient high-resolution image processing.

- **Summary**: In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in the field of image generation, primarily driven by the escalating demand for high-quality outcomes across various image generation subtasks, such as inpainting, denoising, and super resolution. A major effort is devoted to exploring the application of super-resolution techniques to enhance the quality of low-resolution images. In this context, our method explores in depth the problem of ship image super resolution, which is crucial for coastal and port surveillance. We investigate the opportunity given by the growing interest in text-to-image diffusion models, taking advantage of the prior knowledge that such foundation models have already learned. In particular, we present a diffusion-model-based architecture that leverages text conditioning during training while being class-aware, to best preserve the crucial details of the ships during the generation of the super-resoluted image. Since the specificity of this task and the scarcity availability of off-the-shelf data, we also introduce a large labeled ship dataset scraped from online ship images, mostly from ShipSpotting\footnote{\url{www.shipspotting.com}} website. Our method achieves more robust results than other deep learning models previously employed for super resolution, as proven by the multiple experiments performed. Moreover, we investigate how this model can benefit downstream tasks, such as classification and object detection, thus emphasizing practical implementation in a real-world scenario. Experimental results show flexibility, reliability, and impressive performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods for different tasks.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection techniques for deep neural networks (DNNs) become crucial thanks to their filtering of abnormal inputs, especially when DNNs are used in safety-critical applications and interact with an open and dynamic environment. Nevertheless, integrating OoD detection into state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection DNNs poses significant challenges, partly due to the complexity introduced by the SOTA OoD construction methods, which require the modification of DNN architecture and the introduction of complex loss functions. This paper proposes a simple, yet surprisingly effective, method that requires neither retraining nor architectural change in object detection DNN, called Box Abstraction-based Monitors (BAM). The novelty of BAM stems from using a finite union of convex box abstractions to capture the learned features of objects for in-distribution (ID) data, and an important observation that features from OoD data are more likely to fall outside of these boxes. The union of convex regions within the feature space allows the formation of non-convex and interpretable decision boundaries, overcoming the limitations of VOS-like detectors without sacrificing real-time performance. Experiments integrating BAM into Faster R-CNN-based object detection DNNs demonstrate a considerably improved performance against SOTA OoD detection techniques.

- **Summary**: In class-incremental learning (CIL) scenarios, the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting caused by the classifier's bias towards the current task has long posed a significant challenge. It is mainly caused by the characteristic of discriminative models. With the growing popularity of the generative multi-modal models, we would explore replacing discriminative models with generative ones for CIL. However, transitioning from discriminative to generative models requires addressing two key challenges. The primary challenge lies in transferring the generated textual information into the classification of distinct categories. Additionally, it requires formulating the task of CIL within a generative framework. To this end, we propose a novel generative multi-modal model (GMM) framework for class-incremental learning. Our approach directly generates labels for images using an adapted generative model. After obtaining the detailed text, we use a text encoder to extract text features and employ feature matching to determine the most similar label as the classification prediction. In the conventional CIL settings, we achieve significantly better results in long-sequence task scenarios. Under the Few-shot CIL setting, we have improved by at least 14\% accuracy over all the current state-of-the-art methods with significantly less forgetting.

- **Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising avenue for energy-efficient computing compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), closely mirroring biological neural processes. However, this potential comes with inherent challenges in directly training SNNs through spatio-temporal backpropagation -- stemming from the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons and their discrete signal processing -- which necessitates alternative ways of training, most notably through ANN-SNN conversion. In this work, we introduce a lightweight Forward Temporal Bias Correction (FTBC) technique, aimed at enhancing conversion accuracy without the computational overhead. We ground our method on provided theoretical findings that through proper temporal bias calibration the expected error of ANN-SNN conversion can be reduced to be zero after each time step. We further propose a heuristic algorithm for finding the temporal bias only in the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of backpropagation and we evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, achieving a notable increase in accuracy on all datasets.

- **Summary**: Abstract Art is an immensely popular, discussed form of art that often has the ability to depict the emotions of an artist. Many researchers have made attempts to study abstract art in the form of edge detection, brush stroke and emotion recognition algorithms using machine and deep learning. This papers describes the study of a wide distribution of abstract paintings using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN). GANs have the ability to learn and reproduce a distribution enabling researchers and scientists to effectively explore and study the generated image space. However, the challenge lies in developing an efficient GAN architecture that overcomes common training pitfalls. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a modified-DCGAN (mDCGAN) specifically designed for high-quality artwork generation. The approach involves a thorough exploration of the modifications made, delving into the intricate workings of DCGANs, optimisation techniques, and regularisation methods aimed at improving stability and realism in art generation enabling effective study of generated patterns. The proposed mDCGAN incorporates meticulous adjustments in layer configurations and architectural choices, offering tailored solutions to the unique demands of art generation while effectively combating issues like mode collapse and gradient vanishing. Further this paper explores the generated latent space by performing random walks to understand vector relationships between brush strokes and colours in the abstract art space and a statistical analysis of unstable outputs after a certain period of GAN training and compare its significant difference. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, emphasising its potential to revolutionise the field of digital art generation and digital art ecosystem.

- **Summary**: Stimulated by the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), a variety of strategies for bridging video modality have been devised. A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models (VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect advanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has surfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and LLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce a simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is utilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a series of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence of video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with the spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The resulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while maintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal information within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach enables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without necessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis across ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five open-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image Grid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out of ten benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a practical challenge in computer vision. Pseudo-label (PL) methods, e.g., FixMatch and FreeMatch, obtain the State Of The Art (SOTA) performances in SSL. These approaches employ a threshold-to-pseudo-label (T2L) process to generate PLs by truncating the confidence scores of unlabeled data predicted by the self-training method. However, self-trained models typically yield biased and high-variance predictions, especially in the scenarios when a little labeled data are supplied. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight channel-based ensemble method to effectively consolidate multiple inferior PLs into the theoretically guaranteed unbiased and low-variance one. Importantly, our approach can be readily extended to any SSL framework, such as FixMatch or FreeMatch. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on CIFAR10/100 in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: The conditional text-to-image diffusion models have garnered significant attention in recent years. However, the precision of these models is often compromised mainly for two reasons, ambiguous condition input and inadequate condition guidance over single denoising loss. To address the challenges, we introduce two innovative solutions. Firstly, we propose a Spatial Guidance Injector (SGI) which enhances conditional detail by encoding text inputs with precise annotation information. This method directly tackles the issue of ambiguous control inputs by providing clear, annotated guidance to the model. Secondly, to overcome the issue of limited conditional supervision, we introduce Diffusion Consistency Loss (DCL), which applies supervision on the denoised latent code at any given time step. This encourages consistency between the latent code at each time step and the input signal, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the output. The combination of SGI and DCL results in our Effective Controllable Network (ECNet), which offers a more accurate controllable end-to-end text-to-image generation framework with a more precise conditioning input and stronger controllable supervision. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on generation under various conditions, such as human body skeletons, facial landmarks, and sketches of general objects. The results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the controllability and robustness of the generated images, outperforming existing state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image models.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image synthesis, producing realistic and high resolution images that faithfully adhere to the corresponding text-prompts. Despite their great success, they still fall behind in sketch-to-image synthesis tasks, where in addition to text-prompts, the spatial layout of the generated images has to closely follow the outlines of certain reference sketches. Employing an MLP latent edge predictor to guide the spatial layout of the synthesized image by predicting edge maps at each denoising step has been recently proposed. Despite yielding promising results, the pixel-wise operation of the MLP does not take into account the spatial layout as a whole, and demands numerous denoising iterations to produce satisfactory images, leading to time inefficiency. To this end, we introduce U-Sketch, a framework featuring a U-Net type latent edge predictor, which is capable of efficiently capturing both local and global features, as well as spatial correlations between pixels. Moreover, we propose the addition of a sketch simplification network that offers the user the choice of preprocessing and simplifying input sketches for enhanced outputs. The experimental results, corroborated by user feedback, demonstrate that our proposed U-Net latent edge predictor leads to more realistic results, that are better aligned with the spatial outlines of the reference sketches, while drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps and, consequently, the overall execution time.

- **Summary**: Imposing key anatomical features, such as the number of organs, their shapes, sizes, and relative positions, is crucial for building a robust multi-organ segmentation model. Current attempts to incorporate anatomical features include broadening effective receptive fields (ERF) size with resource- and data-intensive modules such as self-attention or introducing organ-specific topology regularizers, which may not scale to multi-organ segmentation problems where inter-organ relation also plays a huge role. We introduce a new approach to impose anatomical constraints on any existing encoder-decoder segmentation model by conditioning model prediction with learnable anatomy prior. More specifically, given an abdominal scan, a part of the encoder spatially warps a learnable prior to align with the given input scan using thin plate spline (TPS) grid interpolation. The warped prior is then integrated during the decoding phase to guide the model for more anatomy-informed predictions.

- **Summary**: Real-world systems often encounter new data over time, which leads to experiencing target domain shifts. Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods tend to apply computationally heavy and memory-intensive backpropagation-based approaches to handle this. Here, we propose a novel method that uses a backpropagation-free approach for TTA for the specific case of 3D data. Our model uses a two-stream architecture to maintain knowledge about the source domain as well as complementary target-domain-specific information. The backpropagation-free property of our model helps address the well-known forgetting problem and mitigates the error accumulation issue. The proposed method also eliminates the need for the usually noisy process of pseudo-labeling and reliance on costly self-supervised training. Moreover, our method leverages subspace learning, effectively reducing the distribution variance between the two domains. Furthermore, the source-domain-specific and the target-domain-specific streams are aligned using a novel entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available at https://github.com/abie-e/BFTT3D.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods have been increasingly given much attention due to the benefit of not requiring large, labelled datasets. Such self-supervised methods require high-quality salient features and consequently suffer from severe performance drop for indoor scenes, where low-textured regions dominant in the scenes are almost indiscriminative. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised indoor monocular depth estimation framework called $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$. A self-supervised optical flow estimation network is introduced to supervise depth learning. To improve optical flow estimation performance in low-textured areas, only some patches of points with more discriminative features are adopted for finetuning based on our well-designed patch-based photometric loss. The finetuned optical flow estimation network generates high-accuracy optical flow as a supervisory signal for depth estimation. Correspondingly, an optical flow consistency loss is designed. Multi-scale feature maps produced by finetuned optical flow estimation network perform warping to compute feature map synthesis loss as another supervisory signal for depth learning. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and our proposed losses. To evaluate the generalization ability of our $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$, we collect a Campus Indoor depth dataset composed of approximately 1500 points selected from 99 images in 18 scenes. Zero-shot generalization experiments on 7-Scenes dataset and Campus Indoor achieve $\delta_1$ accuracy of 75.8% and 76.0% respectively. The accuracy results show that our model can generalize well to monocular images captured in unknown indoor scenes.

- **Summary**: Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

- **Summary**: There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

- **Summary**: The study of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has typically relied on expert trajectories, which may not always be available in real-world situations due to the significant effort required to collect them. On the other hand, existing approaches to training VLN agents that go beyond available expert data involve data augmentations or online exploration which can be tedious and risky. In contrast, it is easy to access large repositories of suboptimal offline trajectories. Inspired by research in offline reinforcement learning (ORL), we introduce a new problem setup of VLN-ORL which studies VLN using suboptimal demonstration data. We introduce a simple and effective reward-conditioned approach that can account for dataset suboptimality for training VLN agents, as well as benchmarks to evaluate progress and promote research in this area. We empirically study various noise models for characterizing dataset suboptimality among other unique challenges in VLN-ORL and instantiate it for the VLN$\circlearrowright$BERT and MTVM architectures in the R2R and RxR environments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed reward-conditioned approach leads to significant performance improvements, even in complex and intricate environments.

- **Summary**: Image style transfer aims to imbue digital imagery with the distinctive attributes of style targets, such as colors, brushstrokes, shapes, whilst concurrently preserving the semantic integrity of the content. Despite the advancements in arbitrary style transfer methods, a prevalent challenge remains the delicate equilibrium between content semantics and style attributes. Recent developments in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heralded unprecedented synthesis capabilities, albeit at the expense of relying on extensive and often imprecise textual descriptions to delineate artistic styles. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces DiffStyler, a novel approach that facilitates efficient and precise arbitrary image style transfer. DiffStyler lies the utilization of a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model-based LoRA to encapsulate the essence of style targets. This approach, coupled with strategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer process. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that LoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that further inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This technique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model, utilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising process, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original image's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style targets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in achieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style integration.

- **Summary**: Digital pathology has recently been revolutionized by advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and high-performance computing. With its advanced tools, digital pathology can help improve and speed up the diagnostic process, reduce human errors, and streamline the reporting step. In this paper, we report a new large red blood cell (RBC) image dataset and propose a two-stage deep learning framework for RBC image segmentation and classification. The dataset is a highly diverse dataset of more than 100K RBCs containing eight different classes. The dataset, which is considerably larger than any publicly available hematopathology dataset, was labeled independently by two hematopathologists who also manually created masks for RBC cell segmentation. Subsequently, in the proposed framework, first, a U-Net model was trained to achieve automatic RBC image segmentation. Second, an EfficientNetB0 model was trained to classify RBC images into one of the eight classes using a transfer learning approach with a 5X2 cross-validation scheme. An IoU of 98.03% and an average classification accuracy of 96.5% were attained on the test set. Moreover, we have performed experimental comparisons against several prominent CNN models. These comparisons show the superiority of the proposed model with a good balance between performance and computational cost.

- **Summary**: 3D synthetic-to-real unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation is crucial to annotating new domains. Self-training is a competitive approach for this task, but its performance is limited by different sensor sampling patterns (i.e., variations in point density) and incomplete training strategies. In this work, we propose a density-guided translator (DGT), which translates point density between domains, and integrates it into a two-stage self-training pipeline named DGT-ST. First, in contrast to existing works that simultaneously conduct data generation and feature/output alignment within unstable adversarial training, we employ the non-learnable DGT to bridge the domain gap at the input level. Second, to provide a well-initialized model for self-training, we propose a category-level adversarial network in stage one that utilizes the prototype to prevent negative transfer. Finally, by leveraging the designs above, a domain-mixed self-training method with source-aware consistency loss is proposed in stage two to narrow the domain gap further. Experiments on two synthetic-to-real segmentation tasks (SynLiDAR $\rightarrow$ semanticKITTI and SynLiDAR $\rightarrow$ semanticPOSS) demonstrate that DGT-ST outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 9.4$\%$ and 4.3$\%$ mIoU improvements, respectively.

- **Summary**: The rapid progress in deep learning has given rise to hyper-realistic facial forgery methods, leading to concerns related to misinformation and security risks. Existing face forgery datasets have limitations in generating high-quality facial images and addressing the challenges posed by evolving generative techniques. To combat this, we present DiffusionFace, the first diffusion-based face forgery dataset, covering various forgery categories, including unconditional and Text Guide facial image generation, Img2Img, Inpaint, and Diffusion-based facial exchange algorithms. Our DiffusionFace dataset stands out with its extensive collection of 11 diffusion models and the high-quality of the generated images, providing essential metadata and a real-world internet-sourced forgery facial image dataset for evaluation. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the data and introduce practical evaluation protocols to rigorously assess discriminative models' effectiveness in detecting counterfeit facial images, aiming to enhance security in facial image authentication processes.

- **Summary**: We present Stochastic Gaussian Splatting (SGS): the first framework for uncertainty estimation using Gaussian Splatting (GS). GS recently advanced the novel-view synthesis field by achieving impressive reconstruction quality at a fraction of the computational cost of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, contrary to the latter, it still lacks the ability to provide information about the confidence associated with their outputs. To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a Variational Inference-based approach that seamlessly integrates uncertainty prediction into the common rendering pipeline of GS. Additionally, we introduce the Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) as a new term in the loss function, enabling optimization of uncertainty estimation alongside image reconstruction. Experimental results on the LLFF dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both image rendering quality and uncertainty estimation accuracy. Overall, our framework equips practitioners with valuable insights into the reliability of synthesized views, facilitating safer decision-making in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes a new knowledge distillation method tailored for image semantic segmentation, termed Intra- and Inter-Class Knowledge Distillation (I2CKD). The focus of this method is on capturing and transferring knowledge between the intermediate layers of teacher (cumbersome model) and student (compact model). For knowledge extraction, we exploit class prototypes derived from feature maps. To facilitate knowledge transfer, we employ a triplet loss in order to minimize intra-class variances and maximize inter-class variances between teacher and student prototypes. Consequently, I2CKD enables the student to better mimic the feature representation of the teacher for each class, thereby enhancing the segmentation performance of the compact network. Extensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and CamVid, using various teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have benefited from large-scale and high-quality data, demonstrating impressive performance. However, these T2I models still struggle to produce images that are aesthetically pleasing, geometrically accurate, faithful to text, and of good low-level quality. We present VersaT2I, a versatile training framework that can boost the performance with multiple rewards of any T2I model. We decompose the quality of the image into several aspects such as aesthetics, text-image alignment, geometry, low-level quality, etc. Then, for every quality aspect, we select high-quality images in this aspect generated by the model as the training set to finetune the T2I model using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Furthermore, we introduce a gating function to combine multiple quality aspects, which can avoid conflicts between different quality aspects. Our method is easy to extend and does not require any manual annotation, reinforcement learning, or model architecture changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaT2I outperforms the baseline methods across various quality criteria.

- **Summary**: Deep subsurface exploration is important for mining, oil and gas industries, as well as in the assessment of geological units for the disposal of chemical or nuclear waste, or the viability of geothermal energy systems. Typically, detailed examinations of subsurface formations or units are performed on cuttings or core materials extracted during drilling campaigns, as well as on geophysical borehole data, which provide detailed information about the petrophysical properties of the rocks. Depending on the volume of rock samples and the analytical program, the laboratory analysis and diagnostics can be very time-consuming. This study investigates the potential of utilizing machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to assess the lithology and mineral content solely from analysis of drill core images, aiming to support and expedite the subsurface geological exploration. The paper outlines a comprehensive methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, machine learning methods, and transfer learning techniques. The outcome reveals a remarkable 96.7% accuracy in the classification of drill core segments into distinct formation classes. Furthermore, a CNN model was trained for the evaluation of mineral content using a learning data set from multidimensional log analysis data (silicate, total clay, carbonate). When benchmarked against laboratory XRD measurements on samples from the cores, both the advanced multidimensional log analysis model and the neural network approach developed here provide equally good performance. This work demonstrates that deep learning and particularly transfer learning can support extracting petrophysical properties, including mineral content and formation classification, from drill core images, thus offering a road map for enhancing model performance and data set quality in image-based analysis of drill cores.

- **Summary**: Computational analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescence histology data is emerging as an important method for understanding the tumour micro-environment in cancer. This work presents HEMIT, a dataset designed for translating Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) sections to multiplex-immunohistochemistry (mIHC) images, featuring DAPI, CD3, and panCK markers. Distinctively, HEMIT's mIHC images are multi-component and cellular-level aligned with H&E, enriching supervised stain translation tasks. To our knowledge, HEMIT is the first publicly available cellular-level aligned dataset that enables H&E to multi-target mIHC image translation. This dataset provides the computer vision community with a valuable resource to develop novel computational methods which have the potential to gain new insights from H&E slide archives.   We also propose a new dual-branch generator architecture, using residual Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin Transformers which achieves better translation outcomes than other popular algorithms. When evaluated on HEMIT, it outperforms pix2pixHD, pix2pix, U-Net, and ResNet, achieving the highest overall score on key metrics including the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Pearson correlation score (R), and Peak signal-to-noise Ratio (PSNR). Additionally, downstream analysis has been used to further validate the quality of the generated mIHC images. These results set a new benchmark in the field of stain translation tasks.

- **Summary**: We study a challenging task: text-to-motion synthesis, aiming to generate motions that align with textual descriptions and exhibit coordinated movements. Currently, the part-based methods introduce part partition into the motion synthesis process to achieve finer-grained generation. However, these methods encounter challenges such as the lack of coordination between different part motions and difficulties for networks to understand part concepts. Moreover, introducing finer-grained part concepts poses computational complexity challenges. In this paper, we propose Part-Coordinating Text-to-Motion Synthesis (ParCo), endowed with enhanced capabilities for understanding part motions and communication among different part motion generators, ensuring a coordinated and fined-grained motion synthesis. Specifically, we discretize whole-body motion into multiple part motions to establish the prior concept of different parts. Afterward, we employ multiple lightweight generators designed to synthesize different part motions and coordinate them through our part coordination module. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on common benchmarks with economic computations, including HumanML3D and KIT-ML, providing substantial evidence of its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised pathology detection can be implemented by training a model on healthy data only and measuring the deviation from the training set upon inference, for example with CNN-based feature extraction and one-class classifiers, or reconstruction-score-based methods such as AEs, GANs and Diffusion models. Normalizing Flows (NF) have the ability to directly learn the probability distribution of training examples through an invertible architecture. We leverage this property in a novel 3D NF-based model named CT-3DFlow, specifically tailored for patient-level pulmonary pathology detection in chest CT data. Our model is trained unsupervised on healthy 3D pulmonary CT patches, and detects deviations from its log-likelihood distribution as anomalies. We aggregate patches-level likelihood values from a patient's CT scan to provide a patient-level 'normal'/'abnormal' prediction. Out-of-distribution detection performance is evaluated using expert annotations on a separate chest CT test dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown promising Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization under various types of distribution shifts. Recent studies attempted to investigate the leading cause of this capability. In this work, we follow the same path, but focus on a specific type of OoD data - images with novel compositions of attribute-object pairs - and study whether such models can successfully classify those images into composition classes. We carefully designed an authentic image test dataset called ImageNet-AO, consisting of attributes for objects that are unlikely encountered in the CLIP training sets. We found that CLIPs trained with large datasets such as OpenAI CLIP, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B show orders-of-magnitude improvement in effective compositional OoD generalization compared to both supervised models and CLIPs trained with smaller datasets, such as CC-12M and YFCC-15M. Our results provide evidence that the scale and diversity of training data and language supervision play a key role in unlocking the compositional generalization abilities of vision-language models.

- **Summary**: Fast and robust object grasping in clutter is a crucial component of robotics. Most current works resort to the whole observed point cloud for 6-Dof grasp generation, ignoring the guidance information excavated from global semantics, thus limiting high-quality grasp generation and real-time performance. In this work, we show that the widely used heatmaps are underestimated in the efficiency of 6-Dof grasp generation. Therefore, we propose an effective local grasp generator combined with grasp heatmaps as guidance, which infers in a global-to-local semantic-to-point way. Specifically, Gaussian encoding and the grid-based strategy are applied to predict grasp heatmaps as guidance to aggregate local points into graspable regions and provide global semantic information. Further, a novel non-uniform anchor sampling mechanism is designed to improve grasp accuracy and diversity. Benefiting from the high-efficiency encoding in the image space and focusing on points in local graspable regions, our framework can perform high-quality grasp detection in real-time and achieve state-of-the-art results. In addition, real robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a success rate of 94% and a clutter completion rate of 100%.

- **Summary**: Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However, few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) introduces a paradigm in which the problem space expands with limited data. FSCIL methods inherently face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting as data arrives incrementally, making models susceptible to overwriting previously acquired knowledge. Moreover, given the scarcity of labeled samples available at any given time, models may be prone to overfitting and find it challenging to strike a balance between extensive pretraining and the limited incremental data. To address these challenges, we propose the OrCo framework built on two core principles: features' orthogonality in the representation space, and contrastive learning. In particular, we improve the generalization of the embedding space by employing a combination of supervised and self-supervised contrastive losses during the pretraining phase. Additionally, we introduce OrCo loss to address challenges arising from data limitations during incremental sessions. Through feature space perturbations and orthogonality between classes, the OrCo loss maximizes margins and reserves space for the following incremental data. This, in turn, ensures the accommodation of incoming classes in the feature space without compromising previously acquired knowledge. Our experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet, CIFAR100, and CUB datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent thrilling progress in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has unlocked unprecedented synthesis quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) including image generation, 3D and video composition. Further, personalized techniques enable appealing customized production of a novel concept given only several images as reference. However, an intriguing problem persists: Is it possible to capture multiple, novel concepts from one single reference image? In this paper, we identify that existing approaches fail to preserve visual consistency with the reference image and eliminate cross-influence from concepts. To alleviate this, we propose an attention calibration mechanism to improve the concept-level understanding of the T2I model. Specifically, we first introduce new learnable modifiers bound with classes to capture attributes of multiple concepts. Then, the classes are separated and strengthened following the activation of the cross-attention operation, ensuring comprehensive and self-contained concepts. Additionally, we suppress the attention activation of different classes to mitigate mutual influence among concepts. Together, our proposed method, dubbed DisenDiff, can learn disentangled multiple concepts from one single image and produce novel customized images with learned concepts. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state of the art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. More importantly, our proposed techniques are compatible with LoRA and inpainting pipelines, enabling more interactive experiences.

- **Summary**: Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) aims to identify the common and salient (usually in the foreground) regions across a given group of images. Although achieving significant progress, state-of-the-art CoSODs could be easily affected by some adversarial perturbations, leading to substantial accuracy reduction. The adversarial perturbations can mislead CoSODs but do not change the high-level semantic information (e.g., concept) of the co-salient objects. In this paper, we propose a novel robustness enhancement framework by first learning the concept of the co-salient objects based on the input group images and then leveraging this concept to purify adversarial perturbations, which are subsequently fed to CoSODs for robustness enhancement. Specifically, we propose CosalPure containing two modules, i.e., group-image concept learning and concept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module, we adopt a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient objects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial examples. For the second module, we map the adversarial image to the latent space and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept into the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can effectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing different adversarial patterns, including exposure and noise. The extensive results demonstrate that our method could enhance the robustness of CoSODs significantly.

- **Summary**: Deep learning based approaches have been used to improve image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a medical imaging technique often used in applications such as image-guided radiation therapy, implant dentistry or orthopaedics. In particular, while deep learning methods have been applied to reduce various types of CBCT image artifacts arising from motion, metal objects, or low-dose acquisition, a comprehensive review summarizing the successes and shortcomings of these approaches, with a primary focus on the type of artifacts rather than the architecture of neural networks, is lacking in the literature. In this review, the data generation and simulation pipelines, and artifact reduction techniques are specifically investigated for each type of artifact. We provide an overview of deep learning techniques that have successfully been shown to reduce artifacts in 3D, as well as in time-resolved (4D) CBCT through the use of projection- and/or volume-domain optimizations, or by introducing neural networks directly within the CBCT reconstruction algorithms. Research gaps are identified to suggest avenues for future exploration. One of the key findings of this work is an observed trend towards the use of generative models including GANs and score-based or diffusion models, accompanied with the need for more diverse and open training datasets and simulations.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh robustly from a single image is very challenging, due to the lack of diversity in existing real-world datasets. While data synthesis helps relieve the issue, the syn-to-real gap still hinders its usage. In this work, we present HandBooster, a new approach to uplift the data diversity and boost the 3D hand-mesh reconstruction performance by training a conditional generative space on hand-object interactions and purposely sampling the space to synthesize effective data samples. First, we construct versatile content-aware conditions to guide a diffusion model to produce realistic images with diverse hand appearances, poses, views, and backgrounds; favorably, accurate 3D annotations are obtained for free. Then, we design a novel condition creator based on our similarity-aware distribution sampling strategies to deliberately find novel and realistic interaction poses that are distinctive from the training set. Equipped with our method, several baselines can be significantly improved beyond the SOTA on the HO3D and DexYCB benchmarks. Our code will be released on https://github.com/hxwork/HandBooster_Pytorch.

- **Summary**: Resource efficiency plays an important role for machine learning nowadays. The energy and decision latency are two critical aspects to ensure a sustainable and practical application. Unfortunately, the energy consumption and decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have recently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge examples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision latency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts inputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to accelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these energy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that input uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with mostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a specific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation. Based on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies for crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution and identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We empirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple image classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity effect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation effort. We also show that our sponge examples transfer between different neural networks. Finally, we discuss applications of our findings for the good by improving efficiency by increasing sparsity.

- **Summary**: We performed pairwise comparisons by human raters of JPEG images from MozJPEG, libjpeg-turbo and our new Jpegli encoder. When compressing images at a quality similar to libjpeg-turbo quality 95, the Jpegli images were 54% likely to be preferred over both libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG images, but used only 2.8 bits per pixel compared to libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG that used 3.8 and 3.5 bits per pixel respectively. The raw ratings and source images are publicly available for further analysis and study.



### Homogeneous Tokenizer Matters: Homogeneous Visual Tokenizer for Remote Sensing Image Understanding

- **Summary**: The tokenizer, as one of the fundamental components of large models, has long been overlooked or even misunderstood in visual tasks. One key factor of the great comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language tokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of language. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based methods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic elements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in language. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically independent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual tOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception Module (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity, the OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention mechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds within the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number of learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of token quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19 classification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense tasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK correspond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK outperformed Patch Embed by 6\% and 10\% in the two tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison. Compared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one image, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks, respectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times.

- **Summary**: Procedure Planning in instructional videos entails generating a sequence of action steps based on visual observations of the initial and target states. Despite the rapid progress in this task, there remain several critical challenges to be solved: (1) Adaptive procedures: Prior works hold an unrealistic assumption that the number of action steps is known and fixed, leading to non-generalizable models in real-world scenarios where the sequence length varies. (2) Temporal relation: Understanding the step temporal relation knowledge is essential in producing reasonable and executable plans. (3) Annotation cost: Annotating instructional videos with step-level labels (i.e., timestamp) or sequence-level labels (i.e., action category) is demanding and labor-intensive, limiting its generalizability to large-scale datasets.In this work, we propose a new and practical setting, called adaptive procedure planning in instructional videos, where the procedure length is not fixed or pre-determined. To address these challenges we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Planner (RAP) model. Specifically, for adaptive procedures, RAP adaptively determines the conclusion of actions using an auto-regressive model architecture. For temporal relation, RAP establishes an external memory module to explicitly retrieve the most relevant state-action pairs from the training videos and revises the generated procedures. To tackle high annotation cost, RAP utilizes a weakly-supervised learning manner to expand the training dataset to other task-relevant, unannotated videos by generating pseudo labels for action steps. Experiments on CrossTask and COIN benchmarks show the superiority of RAP over traditional fixed-length models, establishing it as a strong baseline solution for adaptive procedure planning.

- **Summary**: Our work addresses limitations seen in previous approaches for object-centric editing problems, such as unrealistic results due to shape discrepancies and limited control in object replacement or insertion. To this end, we introduce FlexEdit, a flexible and controllable editing framework for objects where we iteratively adjust latents at each denoising step using our FlexEdit block. Initially, we optimize latents at test time to align with specified object constraints. Then, our framework employs an adaptive mask, automatically extracted during denoising, to protect the background while seamlessly blending new content into the target image. We demonstrate the versatility of FlexEdit in various object editing tasks and curate an evaluation test suite with samples from both real and synthetic images, along with novel evaluation metrics designed for object-centric editing. We conduct extensive experiments on different editing scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of our editing framework over recent advanced text-guided image editing methods.

- **Summary**: Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system. This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR). When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively. However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data. Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs. Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects. This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed. The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.

- **Summary**: In recent years, instruction-based image editing methods have garnered significant attention in image editing. However, despite encompassing a wide range of editing priors, these methods are helpless when handling editing tasks that are challenging to accurately describe through language. We propose InstructBrush, an inversion method for instruction-based image editing methods to bridge this gap. It extracts editing effects from exemplar image pairs as editing instructions, which are further applied for image editing. Two key techniques are introduced into InstructBrush, Attention-based Instruction Optimization and Transformation-oriented Instruction Initialization, to address the limitations of the previous method in terms of inversion effects and instruction generalization. To explore the ability of instruction inversion methods to guide image editing in open scenarios, we establish a TransformationOriented Paired Benchmark (TOP-Bench), which contains a rich set of scenes and editing types. The creation of this benchmark paves the way for further exploration of instruction inversion. Quantitatively and qualitatively, our approach achieves superior performance in editing and is more semantically consistent with the target editing effects.

- **Summary**: Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image processing. These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry. However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many challenges have emerged. This thesis presents various approaches that address robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.   Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before certification and deployment in practice. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the adversarial attack literature. In addition, building trust in AI-based models requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that are more explainable and interpretable a priori.   This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and explainability. Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in the related research. Besides methodological developments for robust and explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and improving their design and robustness. In addition to the theoretical developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.

- **Summary**: Annolid is a deep learning-based software package designed for the segmentation, labeling, and tracking of research targets within video files, focusing primarily on animal behavior analysis. Based on state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods, Annolid now harnesses the Cutie video object segmentation model to achieve resilient, markerless tracking of multiple animals from single annotated frames, even in environments in which they may be partially or entirely concealed by environmental features or by one another. Our integration of Segment Anything and Grounding-DINO strategies additionally enables the automatic masking and segmentation of recognizable animals and objects by text command, removing the need for manual annotation. Annolid's comprehensive approach to object segmentation flexibly accommodates a broad spectrum of behavior analysis applications, enabling the classification of diverse behavioral states such as freezing, digging, pup huddling, and social interactions in addition to the tracking of animals and their body parts.

- **Summary**: Few-shot model compression aims to compress a large model into a more compact one with only a tiny training set (even without labels). Block-level pruning has recently emerged as a leading technique in achieving high accuracy and low latency in few-shot CNN compression. But, few-shot compression for Vision Transformers (ViT) remains largely unexplored, which presents a new challenge. In particular, the issue of sparse compression exists in traditional CNN few-shot methods, which can only produce very few compressed models of different model sizes. This paper proposes a novel framework for few-shot ViT compression named DC-ViT. Instead of dropping the entire block, DC-ViT selectively eliminates the attention module while retaining and reusing portions of the MLP module. DC-ViT enables dense compression, which outputs numerous compressed models that densely populate the range of model complexity. DC-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot compression methods by a significant margin of 10 percentage points, along with lower latency in the compression of ViT and its variants.

- **Summary**: Current stereo-vision pipelines produce high accuracy 3D reconstruction when using multiple pairs or triplets of satellite images. However, these pipelines are sensitive to the changes between images that can occur as a result of multi-date acquisitions. Such variations are mainly due to variable shadows, reflexions and transient objects (cars, vegetation). To take such changes into account, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently been applied to multi-date satellite imagery. However, Neural methods are very compute-intensive, taking dozens of hours to learn, compared with minutes for standard stereo-vision pipelines. Following the ideas of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives we propose to use an efficient sampling strategy and multi-resolution hash encoding to accelerate the learning. Our model, Satellite Neural Graphics Primitives (SAT-NGP) decreases the learning time to 15 minutes while maintaining the quality of the 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: AI-Generated Images (AGIs) have inherent multimodal nature. Unlike traditional image quality assessment (IQA) on natural scenarios, AGIs quality assessment (AGIQA) takes the correspondence of image and its textual prompt into consideration. This is coupled in the ground truth score, which confuses the unimodal IQA methods. To solve this problem, we introduce IP-IQA (AGIs Quality Assessment via Image and Prompt), a multimodal framework for AGIQA via corresponding image and prompt incorporation. Specifically, we propose a novel incremental pretraining task named Image2Prompt for better understanding of AGIs and their corresponding textual prompts. An effective and efficient image-prompt fusion module, along with a novel special [QA] token, are also applied. Both are plug-and-play and beneficial for the cooperation of image and its corresponding prompt. Experiments demonstrate that our IP-IQA achieves the state-of-the-art on AGIQA-1k and AGIQA-3k datasets. Code will be available.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.

- **Summary**: Developing models that can answer questions of the form "How would $x$ change if $y$ had been $z$?" is fundamental for advancing medical image analysis. Training causal generative models that address such counterfactual questions, though, currently requires that all relevant variables have been observed and that corresponding labels are available in training data. However, clinical data may not have complete records for all patients and state of the art causal generative models are unable to take full advantage of this. We thus develop, for the first time, a semi-supervised deep causal generative model that exploits the causal relationships between variables to maximise the use of all available data. We explore this in the setting where each sample is either fully labelled or fully unlabelled, as well as the more clinically realistic case of having different labels missing for each sample. We leverage techniques from causal inference to infer missing values and subsequently generate realistic counterfactuals, even for samples with incomplete labels.

- **Summary**: Lighting normalization is a crucial but underexplored restoration task with broad applications. However, existing works often simplify this task within the context of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and oversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting surface classes to smooth ones. Although promising, such simplifications hinder generalizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use. In this paper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization (ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image restoration and shadow removal in a broader context. To address the lack of appropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution dataset Ambient6K, comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and including self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously evaluate them on Ambient6K. Additionally, we propose IFBlend, a novel strong baseline that maximizes Image-Frequency joint entropy to selectively restore local areas under different lighting conditions, without relying on shadow localization priors. Experiments show that IFBlend achieves SOTA scores on Ambient6K and exhibits competitive performance on conventional shadow removal benchmarks compared to shadow-specific models with mask priors. The dataset, benchmark, and code are available at https://github.com/fvasluianu97/IFBlend.

- **Summary**: This research presents a method that utilizes explainability techniques to amplify the performance of machine learning (ML) models in forecasting the quality of milling processes, as demonstrated in this paper through a manufacturing use case. The methodology entails the initial training of ML models, followed by a fine-tuning phase where irrelevant features identified through explainability methods are eliminated. This procedural refinement results in performance enhancements, paving the way for potential reductions in manufacturing costs and a better understanding of the trained ML models. This study highlights the usefulness of explainability techniques in both explaining and optimizing predictive models in the manufacturing realm.

- **Summary**: We hereby present a full synthetic model, able to mimic the various constituents of the cerebral vascular tree: the cerebral arteries, the bifurcations and the intracranial aneurysms. By building this model, our goal was to provide a substantial dataset of brain arteries which could be used by a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to either segment or detect/recognize various vascular diseases (such as artery dissection/thrombosis) or even some portions of the cerebral vasculature, such as the bifurcations or aneurysms. In this study, we will particularly focus on Intra-Cranial Aneurysm (ICA) detection and segmentation. The cerebral aneurysms most often occur on a particular structure of the vascular tree named the Circle of Willis. Various studies have been conducted to detect and monitor the ICAs and those based on Deep Learning (DL) achieve the best performances. Specifically, in this work, we propose a full synthetic 3D model able to mimic the brain vasculature as acquired by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and more particularly the Time Of Flight (TOF) principle. Among the various MRI modalities, the MRA-TOF allows to have a relatively good rendering of the blood vessels and is non-invasive (no contrast liquid injection). Our model has been designed to simultaneously mimic the arteries geometry, the ICA shape and the background noise. The geometry of the vascular tree is modeled thanks to an interpolation with 3D Spline functions, and the statistical properties of the background MRI noise is collected from MRA acquisitions and reproduced within the model. In this work, we thoroughly describe the synthetic vasculature model, we build up a neural network designed for ICA segmentation and detection, and finally, we carry out an in-depth evaluation of the performance gap gained thanks to the synthetic model data augmentation.

- **Summary**: Aims. To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical atherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A deep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the AI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20% internal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median age 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3 months. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The model was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the same institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC model assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome. Overall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC. AUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation cohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort. Sensitivity was consistently above 92% in both cohorts. In the overall cohort (n=540), among patients with AI-CAC=0, a single ASCVD event occurred, after 4.3 years. Patients with AI-CAC>0 had significantly higher Kaplan Meier estimates for ASCVD events (13.5% vs. 3.4%, log-rank=0.013). Conclusion. The AI-CAC model seems to accurately detect subclinical atherosclerosis on chest x-ray with elevated sensitivity, and to predict ASCVD events with elevated negative predictive value. Adoption of the AI-CAC model to refine CV risk stratification or as an opportunistic screening tool requires prospective evaluation.

- **Summary**: Place recognition is an important task for robots and autonomous cars to localize themselves and close loops in pre-built maps. While single-modal sensor-based methods have shown satisfactory performance, cross-modal place recognition that retrieving images from a point-cloud database remains a challenging problem. Current cross-modal methods transform images into 3D points using depth estimation for modality conversion, which are usually computationally intensive and need expensive labeled data for depth supervision. In this work, we introduce a fast and lightweight framework to encode images and point clouds into place-distinctive descriptors. We propose an effective Field of View (FoV) transformation module to convert point clouds into an analogous modality as images. This module eliminates the necessity for depth estimation and helps subsequent modules achieve real-time performance. We further design a non-negative factorization-based encoder to extract mutually consistent semantic features between point clouds and images. This encoder yields more distinctive global descriptors for retrieval. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance while running in real time. Additional evaluation on the HAOMO dataset covering a 17 km trajectory further shows the practical generalization capabilities. We have released the implementation of our methods as open source at: https://github.com/haomo-ai/ModaLink.git.

- **Summary**: We establish rigorous benchmarks for visual perception robustness. Synthetic images such as ImageNet-C, ImageNet-9, and Stylized ImageNet provide specific type of evaluation over synthetic corruptions, backgrounds, and textures, yet those robustness benchmarks are restricted in specified variations and have low synthetic quality. In this work, we introduce generative model as a data source for synthesizing hard images that benchmark deep models' robustness. Leveraging diffusion models, we are able to generate images with more diversified backgrounds, textures, and materials than any prior work, where we term this benchmark as ImageNet-D. Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models, from the standard ResNet visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4, significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60\%. Our work suggests that diffusion models can be an effective source to test vision models. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/chenshuang-zhang/imagenet_d.

- **Summary**: We present SplatFace, a novel Gaussian splatting framework designed for 3D human face reconstruction without reliance on accurate pre-determined geometry. Our method is designed to simultaneously deliver both high-quality novel view rendering and accurate 3D mesh reconstructions. We incorporate a generic 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to provide a surface geometric structure, making it possible to reconstruct faces with a limited set of input images. We introduce a joint optimization strategy that refines both the Gaussians and the morphable surface through a synergistic non-rigid alignment process. A novel distance metric, splat-to-surface, is proposed to improve alignment by considering both the Gaussian position and covariance. The surface information is also utilized to incorporate a world-space densification process, resulting in superior reconstruction quality. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is competitive with both other Gaussian splatting techniques in novel view synthesis and other 3D reconstruction methods in producing 3D face meshes with high geometric precision.

- **Summary**: Estimating the pose of objects from images is a crucial task of 3D scene understanding, and recent approaches have shown promising results on very large benchmarks. However, these methods experience a significant performance drop when dealing with unseen objects. We believe that it results from the limited generalizability of image features. To address this problem, we have an in-depth analysis on the features of diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion, which hold substantial potential for modeling unseen objects. Based on this analysis, we then innovatively introduce these diffusion features for object pose estimation. To achieve this, we propose three distinct architectures that can effectively capture and aggregate diffusion features of different granularity, greatly improving the generalizability of object pose estimation. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin on three popular benchmark datasets, LM, O-LM, and T-LESS. In particular, our method achieves higher accuracy than the previous best arts on unseen objects: 98.2% vs. 93.5% on Unseen LM, 85.9% vs. 76.3% on Unseen O-LM, showing the strong generalizability of our method. Our code is released at https://github.com/Tianfu18/diff-feats-pose.

- **Summary**: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing a 3D asset from a single image with growing demands for automated 3D content creation pipelines. Previous methods primarily rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Despite their significant success, these approaches encounter practical limitations due to lengthy optimization and considerable memory usage. In this report, we introduce Gamba, an end-to-end amortized 3D reconstruction model from single-view images, emphasizing two main insights: (1) 3D representation: leveraging a large number of 3D Gaussians for an efficient 3D Gaussian splatting process; (2) Backbone design: introducing a Mamba-based sequential network that facilitates context-dependent reasoning and linear scalability with the sequence (token) length, accommodating a substantial number of Gaussians. Gamba incorporates significant advancements in data preprocessing, regularization design, and training methodologies. We assessed Gamba against existing optimization-based and feed-forward 3D generation approaches using the real-world scanned OmniObject3D dataset. Here, Gamba demonstrates competitive generation capabilities, both qualitatively and quantitatively, while achieving remarkable speed, approximately 0.6 second on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

- **Summary**: In the absence of parallax cues, a learning-based single image depth estimation (SIDE) model relies heavily on shading and contextual cues in the image. While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such models on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as CLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration from this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information. We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large dataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of generating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based on this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset, achieving Abs Rel error of 0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD). And on KITTI dataset, achieving Sq Rel error of 0.139 (2% improvement) compared to 0.142 by the current SOTA (GEDepth). For zero-shot transfer with a model trained on NYUv2, we report mean relative improvement of (20%, 23%, 81%, 25%) over NeWCRFs on (Sun-RGBD, iBims1, DIODE, HyperSim) datasets, compared to (16%, 18%, 45%, 9%) by ZoeDepth.

- **Summary**: We introduce a novel task within the field of 3D dance generation, termed dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements from a dance partner, the "follower", synchronized with the lead dancer's movements and the underlying musical rhythm. Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position. To support this task, we first build a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances. To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements. To further enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards. Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce Mini-Gemini, a simple and effective framework enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously. Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models.

- **Summary**: Continual learning aims to learn from a stream of continuously arriving data with minimum forgetting of previously learned knowledge. While previous works have explored the effectiveness of leveraging the generalizable knowledge from pre-trained models in continual learning, existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches focus on the use of a predetermined or task-wise set of adapters or prompts. However, these approaches still suffer from forgetting due to task interference on jointly used parameters or restricted flexibility. The reliance on a static model architecture may lead to the allocation of excessive parameters that are not essential or, conversely, inadequate adaptation for downstream tasks, given that the scale and distribution of incoming data are unpredictable in continual learning. We propose Self-Expansion of pre-trained models with Modularized Adaptation (SEMA), a novel fine-tuning approach which automatically decides to reuse or add adapter modules on demand in continual learning, depending on whether drastic distribution shift that could not be handled by existing modules is detected at different representation levels. We design each adapter module to consist of an adapter and a representation descriptor, specifically, implemented as an autoencoder. The representation descriptor functions as a distributional shift indicator during training and triggers adapter expansion. For better usage of the adapters, an expandable weighting router is learned jointly for mixture of adapter outputs. By comparing with vision-transformer-based continual learning adaptation methods, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art without memory rehearsal.

- **Summary**: We introduce Garment3DGen a new method to synthesize 3D garment assets from a base mesh given a single input image as guidance. Our proposed approach allows users to generate 3D textured clothes based on both real and synthetic images, such as those generated by text prompts. The generated assets can be directly draped and simulated on human bodies. First, we leverage the recent progress of image to 3D diffusion methods to generate 3D garment geometries. However, since these geometries cannot be utilized directly for downstream tasks, we propose to use them as pseudo ground-truth and set up a mesh deformation optimization procedure that deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target. Second, we introduce carefully designed losses that allow the input base mesh to freely deform towards the desired target, yet preserve mesh quality and topology such that they can be simulated. Finally, a texture estimation module generates high-fidelity texture maps that are globally and locally consistent and faithfully capture the input guidance, allowing us to render the generated 3D assets. With Garment3DGen users can generate the textured 3D garment of their choice without the need of artist intervention. One can provide a textual prompt describing the garment they desire to generate a simulation-ready 3D asset. We present a plethora of quantitative and qualitative comparisons on various assets both real and generated and provide use-cases of how one can generate simulation-ready 3D garments.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized image editing but often generate images that violate physical laws, particularly the effects of objects on the scene, e.g., occlusions, shadows, and reflections. By analyzing the limitations of self-supervised approaches, we propose a practical solution centered on a \q{counterfactual} dataset. Our method involves capturing a scene before and after removing a single object, while minimizing other changes. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on this dataset, we are able to not only remove objects but also their effects on the scene. However, we find that applying this approach for photorealistic object insertion requires an impractically large dataset. To tackle this challenge, we propose bootstrap supervision; leveraging our object removal model trained on a small counterfactual dataset, we synthetically expand this dataset considerably. Our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in photorealistic object removal and insertion, particularly at modeling the effects of objects on the scene.

- **Summary**: The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in benchmarking object detectors over the past decade. Like every dataset, COCO contains subtle errors and imperfections stemming from its annotation procedure. With the advent of high-performing models, we ask whether these errors of COCO are hindering its utility in reliably benchmarking further progress. In search for an answer, we inspect thousands of masks from COCO (2017 version) and uncover different types of errors such as imprecise mask boundaries, non-exhaustively annotated instances, and mislabeled masks. Due to the prevalence of COCO, we choose to correct these errors to maintain continuity with prior research. We develop COCO-ReM (Refined Masks), a cleaner set of annotations with visibly better mask quality than COCO-2017. We evaluate fifty object detectors and find that models that predict visually sharper masks score higher on COCO-ReM, affirming that they were being incorrectly penalized due to errors in COCO-2017. Moreover, our models trained using COCO-ReM converge faster and score higher than their larger variants trained using COCO-2017, highlighting the importance of data quality in improving object detectors. With these findings, we advocate using COCO-ReM for future object detection research. Our dataset is available at https://cocorem.xyz

- **Summary**: Faithful human performance capture and free-view rendering from sparse RGB observations is a long-standing problem in Vision and Graphics. The main challenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the setting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields, which have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and geometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\"ively supervising them on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view inputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and high-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or even a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance field weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve as a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This prior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively addressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure of the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a prior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in a pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes feature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field parameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions as well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views. For evaluating our method under different scenarios, we collect a new dataset, WildDynaCap, which contains subjects captured in, both, a dense camera dome and in-the-wild sparse camera rigs, and demonstrate superior results compared to recent state-of-the-art methods on both public and WildDynaCap dataset.

- **Summary**: We present a new dataset called Real Acoustic Fields (RAF) that captures real acoustic room data from multiple modalities. The dataset includes high-quality and densely captured room impulse response data paired with multi-view images, and precise 6DoF pose tracking data for sound emitters and listeners in the rooms. We used this dataset to evaluate existing methods for novel-view acoustic synthesis and impulse response generation which previously relied on synthetic data. In our evaluation, we thoroughly assessed existing audio and audio-visual models against multiple criteria and proposed settings to enhance their performance on real-world data. We also conducted experiments to investigate the impact of incorporating visual data (i.e., images and depth) into neural acoustic field models. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple sim2real approach, where a model is pre-trained with simulated data and fine-tuned with sparse real-world data, resulting in significant improvements in the few-shot learning approach. RAF is the first dataset to provide densely captured room acoustic data, making it an ideal resource for researchers working on audio and audio-visual neural acoustic field modeling techniques.

- **Summary**: Multiple object tracking (MOT), a key task in image recognition, presents a persistent challenge in balancing processing speed and tracking accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages quantum annealing (QA) to expedite computation speed, while enhancing tracking accuracy through the ensembling of object tracking processes. A method to improve the matching integration process is also proposed. By utilizing the sequential nature of MOT, this study further augments the tracking method via reverse annealing (RA). Experimental validation confirms the maintenance of high accuracy with an annealing time of a mere 3 $\mu$s per tracking process. The proposed method holds significant potential for real-time MOT applications, including traffic flow measurement for urban traffic light control, collision prediction for autonomous robots and vehicles, and management of products mass-produced in factories.

- **Summary**: Likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) commonly exhibit a puzzling behaviour: when trained on a relatively complex dataset, they assign higher likelihood values to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from simpler sources. Adding to the mystery, OOD samples are never generated by these DGMs despite having higher likelihoods. This two-pronged paradox has yet to be conclusively explained, making likelihood-based OOD detection unreliable. Our primary observation is that high-likelihood regions will not be generated if they contain minimal probability mass. We demonstrate how this seeming contradiction of large densities yet low probability mass can occur around data confined to low-dimensional manifolds. We also show that this scenario can be identified through local intrinsic dimension (LID) estimation, and propose a method for OOD detection which pairs the likelihoods and LID estimates obtained from a pre-trained DGM. Our method can be applied to normalizing flows and score-based diffusion models, and obtains results which match or surpass state-of-the-art OOD detection benchmarks using the same DGM backbones.

- **Summary**: Accurate monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) is crucial to solving downstream tasks in 3D perception and modeling. However, the remarkable accuracy of recent MMDE methods is confined to their training domains. These methods fail to generalize to unseen domains even in the presence of moderate domain gaps, which hinders their practical applicability. We propose a new model, UniDepth, capable of reconstructing metric 3D scenes from solely single images across domains. Departing from the existing MMDE methods, UniDepth directly predicts metric 3D points from the input image at inference time without any additional information, striving for a universal and flexible MMDE solution. In particular, UniDepth implements a self-promptable camera module predicting dense camera representation to condition depth features. Our model exploits a pseudo-spherical output representation, which disentangles camera and depth representations. In addition, we propose a geometric invariance loss that promotes the invariance of camera-prompted depth features. Thorough evaluations on ten datasets in a zero-shot regime consistently demonstrate the superior performance of UniDepth, even when compared with methods directly trained on the testing domains.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel approach to temporal action localization (TAL) in few-shot learning. Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.

- **Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a flexible and robust technique to adapt models to private users data without training, to handle credit attribution, and to allow efficient machine unlearning at scale. However, RAG techniques for image generation may lead to parts of the retrieved samples being copied in the model's output. To reduce risks of leaking private information contained in the retrieved set, we introduce Copy-Protected generation with Retrieval (CPR), a new method for RAG with strong copyright protection guarantees in a mixed-private setting for diffusion models.CPR allows to condition the output of diffusion models on a set of retrieved images, while also guaranteeing that unique identifiable information about those example is not exposed in the generated outputs. In particular, it does so by sampling from a mixture of public (safe) distribution and private (user) distribution by merging their diffusion scores at inference. We prove that CPR satisfies Near Access Freeness (NAF) which bounds the amount of information an attacker may be able to extract from the generated images. We provide two algorithms for copyright protection, CPR-KL and CPR-Choose. Unlike previously proposed rejection-sampling-based NAF methods, our methods enable efficient copyright-protected sampling with a single run of backward diffusion. We show that our method can be applied to any pre-trained conditional diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion or unCLIP. In particular, we empirically show that applying CPR on top of unCLIP improves quality and text-to-image alignment of the generated results (81.4 to 83.17 on TIFA benchmark), while enabling credit attribution, copy-right protection, and deterministic, constant time, unlearning.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in numerous vision tasks. However, their high processing requirements necessitate efficient hardware acceleration to meet the application's performance targets. In the space of FPGAs, streaming-based dataflow architectures are often adopted by users, as significant performance gains can be achieved through layer-wise pipelining and reduced off-chip memory access by retaining data on-chip. However, modern topologies, such as the UNet, YOLO, and X3D models, utilise long skip connections, requiring significant on-chip storage and thus limiting the performance achieved by such system architectures. The paper addresses the above limitation by introducing weight and activation eviction mechanisms to off-chip memory along the computational pipeline, taking into account the available compute and memory resources. The proposed mechanism is incorporated into an existing toolflow, expanding the design space by utilising off-chip memory as a buffer. This enables the mapping of such modern CNNs to devices with limited on-chip memory, under the streaming architecture design approach. SMOF has demonstrated the capacity to deliver competitive and, in some cases, state-of-the-art performance across a spectrum of computer vision tasks, achieving up to 10.65 X throughput improvement compared to previous works.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been an explosion of 2D vision models for numerous tasks such as semantic segmentation, style transfer or scene editing, enabled by large-scale 2D image datasets. At the same time, there has been renewed interest in 3D scene representations such as neural radiance fields from multi-view images. However, the availability of 3D or multiview data is still substantially limited compared to 2D image datasets, making extending 2D vision models to 3D data highly desirable but also very challenging. Indeed, extending a single 2D vision operator like scene editing to 3D typically requires a highly creative method specialized to that task and often requires per-scene optimization. In this paper, we ask the question of whether any 2D vision model can be lifted to make 3D consistent predictions. We answer this question in the affirmative; our new Lift3D method trains to predict unseen views on feature spaces generated by a few visual models (i.e. DINO and CLIP), but then generalizes to novel vision operators and tasks, such as style transfer, super-resolution, open vocabulary segmentation and image colorization; for some of these tasks, there is no comparable previous 3D method. In many cases, we even outperform state-of-the-art methods specialized for the task in question. Moreover, Lift3D is a zero-shot method, in the sense that it requires no task-specific training, nor scene-specific optimization.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, have revolutionized the field of content generation, enabling significant advancements in areas like image editing and video synthesis. Despite their formidable capabilities, these models are not without their limitations. It is still challenging to synthesize an image that aligns well with the input text, and multiple runs with carefully crafted prompts are required to achieve satisfactory results. To mitigate these limitations, numerous studies have endeavored to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models, i.e., UNet, utilizing various technologies. Yet, amidst these efforts, a pivotal question of text-to-image diffusion model training has remained largely unexplored: Is it possible and feasible to fine-tune the text encoder to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models? Our findings reveal that, instead of replacing the CLIP text encoder used in Stable Diffusion with other large language models, we can enhance it through our proposed fine-tuning approach, TextCraftor, leading to substantial improvements in quantitative benchmarks and human assessments. Interestingly, our technique also empowers controllable image generation through the interpolation of different text encoders fine-tuned with various rewards. We also demonstrate that TextCraftor is orthogonal to UNet finetuning, and can be combined to further improve generative quality.

- **Summary**: We present a generic Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework optimized for crafting adversarial attacks on different model types spanning from ECG signal analysis (1D), image classification (2D), and video classification (3D). The framework focuses on identifying sensitive regions and inducing misclassifications with minimal distortions and various distortion types. The novel RL method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all three applications, proving its efficiency. Our RL approach produces superior localization masks, enhancing interpretability for image classification and ECG analysis models.

- **Summary**: Explaining Deep Learning models is becoming increasingly important in the face of daily emerging multimodal models, particularly in safety-critical domains like medical imaging. However, the lack of detailed investigations into the performance of explainability methods on these models is widening the gap between their development and safe deployment. In this work, we analyze the performance of various explainable AI methods on a vision-language model, MedCLIP, to demystify its inner workings. We also provide a simple methodology to overcome the shortcomings of these methods. Our work offers a different new perspective on the explainability of a recent well-known VLM in the medical domain and our assessment method is generalizable to other current and possible future VLMs.

- **Summary**: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the issue of active speaker detection (ASD) in noisy environments and formulates a robust active speaker detection (rASD) problem. Existing ASD approaches leverage both audio and visual modalities, but non-speech sounds in the surrounding environment can negatively impact performance. To overcome this, we propose a novel framework that utilizes audio-visual speech separation as guidance to learn noise-free audio features. These features are then utilized in an ASD model, and both tasks are jointly optimized in an end-to-end framework. Our proposed framework mitigates residual noise and audio quality reduction issues that can occur in a naive cascaded two-stage framework that directly uses separated speech for ASD, and enables the two tasks to be optimized simultaneously. To further enhance the robustness of the audio features and handle inherent speech noises, we propose a dynamic weighted loss approach to train the speech separator. We also collected a real-world noise audio dataset to facilitate investigations. Experiments demonstrate that non-speech audio noises significantly impact ASD models, and our proposed approach improves ASD performance in noisy environments. The framework is general and can be applied to different ASD approaches to improve their robustness. Our code, models, and data will be released.

- **Summary**: Current methods for 2D and 3D object understanding struggle with severe occlusions in busy urban environments, partly due to the lack of large-scale labeled ground-truth annotations for learning occlusion. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for automatically generating a large, realistic dataset of dynamic objects under occlusions using freely available time-lapse imagery. By leveraging off-the-shelf 2D (bounding box, segmentation, keypoint) and 3D (pose, shape) predictions as pseudo-groundtruth, unoccluded 3D objects are identified automatically and composited into the background in a clip-art style, ensuring realistic appearances and physically accurate occlusion configurations. The resulting clip-art image with pseudo-groundtruth enables efficient training of object reconstruction methods that are robust to occlusions. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both 2D and 3D reconstruction, particularly in scenarios with heavily occluded objects like vehicles and people in urban scenes.

- **Summary**: Wearable collaborative robots stand to assist human wearers who need fall prevention assistance or wear exoskeletons. Such a robot needs to be able to predict the ego motion of the wearer based on egocentric vision and the surrounding scene. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. We introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.

- **Summary**: Illicit object detection is a critical task performed at various high-security locations, including airports, train stations, subways, and ports. The continuous and tedious work of examining thousands of X-ray images per hour can be mentally taxing. Thus, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be used to automate the X-ray image analysis process, improve efficiency and alleviate the security officers' inspection burden. The neural architectures typically utilized in relevant literature are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with Vision Transformers (ViTs) rarely employed. In order to address this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of relevant ViT architectures on illicit item detection in X-ray images. This study utilizes both Transformer and hybrid backbones, such as SWIN and NextViT, and detectors, such as DINO and RT-DETR. The results demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of the DINO Transformer detector in the low-data regime, the impressive real-time performance of YOLOv8, and the effectiveness of the hybrid NextViT backbone.

- **Summary**: There has been tremendous progress in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent works have extended these models to video input with promising instruction following capabilities. However, an important missing piece is temporal localization. These models cannot accurately answer the "When?" questions. We identify three key aspects that limit their temporal localization capabilities: (i) time representation, (ii) architecture, and (iii) data. We address these shortcomings by proposing Language Instructed Temporal-Localization Assistant (LITA) with the following features: (1) We introduce time tokens that encode timestamps relative to the video length to better represent time in videos. (2) We introduce SlowFast tokens in the architecture to capture temporal information at fine temporal resolution. (3) We emphasize temporal localization data for LITA. In addition to leveraging existing video datasets with timestamps, we propose a new task, Reasoning Temporal Localization (RTL), along with the dataset, ActivityNet-RTL, for learning and evaluating this task. Reasoning temporal localization requires both the reasoning and temporal localization of Video LLMs. LITA demonstrates strong performance on this challenging task, nearly doubling the temporal mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of baselines. In addition, we show that our emphasis on temporal localization also substantially improves video-based text generation compared to existing Video LLMs, including a 36% relative improvement of Temporal Understanding.

- **Summary**: Shadows significantly impact computer vision tasks, particularly in outdoor environments. State-of-the-art shadow removal methods are typically too computationally intensive for real-time image processing on edge hardware. We propose ShadowRemovalNet, a novel method designed for real-time image processing on resource-constrained hardware. ShadowRemovalNet achieves significantly higher frame rates compared to existing methods, making it suitable for real-time computer vision pipelines like those used in field robotics. Beyond speed, ShadowRemovalNet offers advantages in efficiency and simplicity, as it does not require a separate shadow mask during inference. ShadowRemovalNet also addresses challenges associated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for shadow removal, including artefacts, inaccurate mask estimations, and inconsistent supervision between shadow and boundary pixels. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel loss function that substantially reduces shadow removal errors. ShadowRemovalNet's efficiency and straightforwardness make it a robust and effective solution for real-time shadow removal in outdoor robotics and edge computing applications.

- **Summary**: Feature point detection and description is the backbone for various computer vision applications, such as Structure-from-Motion, visual SLAM, and visual place recognition. While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for realistic multi-view training data generation. We create a diverse multi-view dataset using NeRFs, consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors to train on NeRF-synthesised views supervised by perspective projective geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data compared to existing approaches.

- **Summary**: Deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have driven major transformations in diverse research areas. However, their limitations in handling low-frequency information present obstacles in certain tasks like interpreting global structures or managing smooth transition images. Despite the promising performance of transformer structures in numerous tasks, their intricate optimization complexities highlight the persistent need for refined CNN enhancements using limited resources. Responding to these complexities, we introduce a novel framework, the Multiscale Low-Frequency Memory (MLFM) Network, with the goal to harness the full potential of CNNs while keeping their complexity unchanged. The MLFM efficiently preserves low-frequency information, enhancing performance in targeted computer vision tasks. Central to our MLFM is the Low-Frequency Memory Unit (LFMU), which stores various low-frequency data and forms a parallel channel to the core network. A key advantage of MLFM is its seamless compatibility with various prevalent networks, requiring no alterations to their original core structure. Testing on ImageNet demonstrated substantial accuracy improvements in multiple 2D CNNs, including ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ConvNeXt. Furthermore, we showcase MLFM's versatility beyond traditional image classification by successfully integrating it into image-to-image translation tasks, specifically in semantic segmentation networks like FCN and U-Net. In conclusion, our work signifies a pivotal stride in the journey of optimizing the efficacy and efficiency of CNNs with limited resources. This research builds upon the existing CNN foundations and paves the way for future advancements in computer vision. Our codes are available at https://github.com/AlphaWuSeu/ MLFM.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this work we focus on learning facial representations that can be adapted to train effective face recognition models, particularly in the absence of labels. Firstly, compared with existing labelled face datasets, a vastly larger magnitude of unlabeled faces exists in the real world. We explore the learning strategy of these unlabeled facial images through self-supervised pretraining to transfer generalized face recognition performance. Moreover, motivated by one recent finding, that is, the face saliency area is critical for face recognition, in contrast to utilizing random cropped blocks of images for constructing augmentations in pretraining, we utilize patches localized by extracted facial landmarks. This enables our method - namely LAndmark-based Facial Self-supervised learning LAFS), to learn key representation that is more critical for face recognition. We also incorporate two landmark-specific augmentations which introduce more diversity of landmark information to further regularize the learning. With learned landmark-based facial representations, we further adapt the representation for face recognition with regularization mitigating variations in landmark positions. Our method achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art on multiple face recognition benchmarks, especially on more challenging few-shot scenarios.

- **Summary**: Image noise and motion artifacts greatly affect the quality of brain MRI and negatively influence downstream medical image analysis. Previous studies often focus on 2D methods that process each volumetric MR image slice-by-slice, thus losing important 3D anatomical information. Additionally, these studies generally treat image denoising and artifact correction as two standalone tasks, without considering their potential relationship, especially on low-quality images where severe noise and motion artifacts occur simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a Joint image Denoising and motion Artifact Correction (JDAC) framework via iterative learning to handle noisy MRIs with motion artifacts, consisting of an adaptive denoising model and an anti-artifact model. In the adaptive denoising model, we first design a novel noise level estimation strategy, and then adaptively reduce the noise through a U-Net backbone with feature normalization conditioning on the estimated noise variance. The anti-artifact model employs another U-Net for eliminating motion artifacts, incorporating a novel gradient-based loss function designed to maintain the integrity of brain anatomy during the motion correction process. These two models are iteratively employed for joint image denoising and artifact correction through an iterative learning framework. An early stopping strategy depending on noise level estimation is applied to accelerate the iteration process. The denoising model is trained with 9,544 T1-weighted MRIs with manually added Gaussian noise as supervision. The anti-artifact model is trained on 552 T1-weighted MRIs with motion artifacts and paired motion-free images. Experimental results on a public dataset and a clinical study suggest the effectiveness of JDAC in both tasks of denoising and motion artifact correction, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks present a significant security risk to image recognition tasks. Defending against these attacks in a real-life setting can be compared to the way antivirus software works, with a key consideration being how well the defense can adapt to new and evolving attacks. Another important factor is the resources involved in terms of time and cost for training defense models and updating the model database. Training many models that are specific to each type of attack can be time-consuming and expensive. Ideally, we should be able to train one single model that can handle a wide range of attacks. It appears that a defense method based on image-to-image translation may be capable of this. The proposed versatile defense approach in this paper only requires training one model to effectively resist various unknown adversarial attacks. The trained model has successfully improved the classification accuracy from nearly zero to an average of 86%, performing better than other defense methods proposed in prior studies. When facing the PGD attack and the MI-FGSM attack, versatile defense model even outperforms the attack-specific models trained based on these two attacks. The robustness check also shows that our versatile defense model performs stably regardless with the attack strength.

- **Summary**: 3D visual grounding aims to automatically locate the 3D region of the specified object given the corresponding textual description. Existing works fail to distinguish similar objects especially when multiple referred objects are involved in the description. Experiments show that direct matching of language and visual modal has limited capacity to comprehend complex referential relationships in utterances. It is mainly due to the interference caused by redundant visual information in cross-modal alignment. To strengthen relation-orientated mapping between different modalities, we propose SeCG, a semantic-enhanced relational learning model based on a graph network with our designed memory graph attention layer. Our method replaces original language-independent encoding with cross-modal encoding in visual analysis. More text-related feature expressions are obtained through the guidance of global semantics and implicit relationships. Experimental results on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly improving the localization performance for the multi-relation challenges.

- **Summary**: Structured pruning methods are developed to bridge the gap between the massive scale of neural networks and the limited hardware resources. Most current structured pruning methods rely on training datasets to fine-tune the compressed model, resulting in high computational burdens and being inapplicable for scenarios with stringent requirements on privacy and security. As an alternative, some data-free methods have been proposed, however, these methods often require handcraft parameter tuning and can only achieve inflexible reconstruction. In this paper, we propose the Automatic Data-Free Pruning (AutoDFP) method that achieves automatic pruning and reconstruction without fine-tuning. Our approach is based on the assumption that the loss of information can be partially compensated by retaining focused information from similar channels. Specifically, We formulate data-free pruning as an optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed through reinforcement learning. AutoDFP assesses the similarity of channels for each layer and provides this information to the reinforcement learning agent, guiding the pruning and reconstruction process of the network. We evaluate AutoDFP with multiple networks on multiple datasets, achieving impressive compression results. For instance, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, AutoDFP demonstrates a 2.87\% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the recently proposed data-free pruning method DFPC with fewer FLOPs on VGG-16. Furthermore, on the ImageNet dataset, AutoDFP achieves 43.17\% higher accuracy than the SOTA method with the same 80\% preserved ratio on MobileNet-V1.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of communication and network security, the increasing reliance on deep neural networks (DNNs) and cloud services for data processing presents a significant vulnerability: the potential for backdoors that can be exploited by malicious actors. Our approach leverages advanced tensor decomposition algorithms Independent Vector Analysis (IVA), Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA), and Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC2) to meticulously analyze the weights of pre-trained DNNs and distinguish between backdoored and clean models effectively. The key strengths of our method lie in its domain independence, adaptability to various network architectures, and ability to operate without access to the training data of the scrutinized models. This not only ensures versatility across different application scenarios but also addresses the challenge of identifying backdoors without prior knowledge of the specific triggers employed to alter network behavior. We have applied our detection pipeline to three distinct computer vision datasets, encompassing both image classification and object detection tasks. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in both accuracy and efficiency over existing backdoor detection methods. This advancement enhances the security of deep learning and AI in networked systems, providing essential cybersecurity against evolving threats in emerging technologies.

- **Summary**: Traditional deep learning methods struggle to simultaneously segment, recognize, and forecast human activities from sensor data. This limits their usefulness in many fields such as healthcare and assisted living, where real-time understanding of ongoing and upcoming activities is crucial. This paper introduces P2LHAP, a novel Patch-to-Label Seq2Seq framework that tackles all three tasks in a efficient single-task model. P2LHAP divides sensor data streams into a sequence of "patches", served as input tokens, and outputs a sequence of patch-level activity labels including the predicted future activities. A unique smoothing technique based on surrounding patch labels, is proposed to identify activity boundaries accurately. Additionally, P2LHAP learns patch-level representation by sensor signal channel-independent Transformer encoders and decoders. All channels share embedding and Transformer weights across all sequences. Evaluated on three public datasets, P2LHAP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in all three tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Despite the impressive performance achieved by data-fusion networks with duplex encoders for visual semantic segmentation, they become ineffective when spatial geometric data are not available. Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a duplex-encoder teacher model into a single-encoder student model is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue. This paper delves into this topic and resorts to knowledge distillation approaches to address this problem. We introduce the Learning to Infuse "X" (LIX) framework, with novel contributions in both logit distillation and feature distillation aspects. We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two technical novelties: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Normalizing flow is a generative modeling approach with efficient sampling. However, Flow-based models suffer two issues, which are manifold and discrete data. If the target distribution is a manifold, which means the dimension of the latent target distribution and the dimension of the data distribution are unmatched, flow-based models might perform badly. Discrete data makes flow-based models collapse into a degenerate mixture of point masses. In this paper, to sidestep such two issues we propose PaddingFlow, a novel dequantization method, which improves normalizing flows with padding-dimensional noise. PaddingFlow is easy to implement, computationally cheap, widely suitable for various tasks, and generates samples that are unbiased estimations of the data. Especially, our method can overcome the limitation of existing dequantization methods that have to change the data distribution, which might degrade performance. We validate our method on the main benchmarks of unconditional density estimation, including five tabular datasets and four image datasets for VAE models, and the IK experiments which are conditional density estimation. The results show that PaddingFlow can provide improvement on all tasks in this paper.



### REPAIR: Rank Correlation and Noisy Pair Half-replacing with Memory for Noisy Correspondence

- **Summary**: The presence of noise in acquired data invariably leads to performance degradation in cross-modal matching. Unfortunately, obtaining precise annotations in the multimodal field is expensive, which has prompted some methods to tackle the mismatched data pair issue in cross-modal matching contexts, termed as noisy correspondence. However, most of these existing noisy correspondence methods exhibit the following limitations: a) the problem of self-reinforcing error accumulation, and b) improper handling of noisy data pair. To tackle the two problems, we propose a generalized framework termed as Rank corrElation and noisy Pair hAlf-replacing wIth memoRy (REPAIR), which benefits from maintaining a memory bank for features of matched pairs. Specifically, we calculate the distances between the features in the memory bank and those of the target pair for each respective modality, and use the rank correlation of these two sets of distances to estimate the soft correspondence label of the target pair. Estimating soft correspondence based on memory bank features rather than using a similarity network can avoid the accumulation of errors due to incorrect network identifications. For pairs that are completely mismatched, REPAIR searches the memory bank for the most matching feature to replace one feature of one modality, instead of using the original pair directly or merely discarding the mismatched pair. We conduct experiments on three cross-modal datasets, i.e., Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and CC152K, proving the effectiveness and robustness of our REPAIR on synthetic and real-world noise.

- **Summary**: Not identical but similar objects are everywhere in the world. Examples include four-legged animals such as dogs and cats, cars of different models, akin flowers in various colors, and countless others. In this study, we address a novel task of matching such non-identical objects. We propose a simple weighting scheme of descriptors that enhance various sparse image matching methods, which are originally designed for matching identical objects captured from different perspectives, and achieve semantically robust matching. The experiments show successful matching between non-identical objects in various cases including domain shift. Further, we present a first evaluation of the robustness of the image matching methods under common corruptions, which is a sort of domain shift, and the proposed method improves the matching in this case as well.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel point cloud compression method COT-PCC by formulating the task as a constrained optimal transport (COT) problem. COT-PCC takes the bitrate of compressed features as an extra constraint of optimal transport (OT) which learns the distribution transformation between original and reconstructed points. Specifically, the formulated COT is implemented with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a bitrate loss for training. The discriminator measures the Wasserstein distance between input and reconstructed points, and a generator calculates the optimal mapping between distributions of input and reconstructed point cloud. Moreover, we introduce a learnable sampling module for downsampling in the compression procedure. Extensive results on both sparse and dense point cloud datasets demonstrate that COT-PCC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both CD and PSNR metrics.

- **Journal**: 10.1109/LRA.2024.3375257
- **Summary**: The state recognition of the environment and objects by robots is generally based on the judgement of the current state as a classification problem. On the other hand, state changes of food in cooking happen continuously and need to be captured not only at a certain time point but also continuously over time. In addition, the state changes of food are complex and cannot be easily described by manual programming. Therefore, we propose a method to recognize the continuous state changes of food for cooking robots through the spoken language using pre-trained large-scale vision-language models. By using models that can compute the similarity between images and texts continuously over time, we can capture the state changes of food while cooking. We also show that by adjusting the weighting of each text prompt based on fitting the similarity changes to a sigmoid function and then performing black-box optimization, more accurate and robust continuous state recognition can be achieved. We demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of this method by performing the recognition of water boiling, butter melting, egg cooking, and onion stir-frying.

- **Summary**: Ring artifacts in computed tomography images, arising from the undesirable responses of detector units, significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-domain regularization model to effectively remove ring artifacts, while maintaining the integrity of the original CT image. The proposed model corrects the vertical stripe artifacts on the sinogram by innovatively updating the response inconsistency compensation coefficients of detector units, which is achieved by employing the group sparse constraint and the projection-view direction sparse constraint on the stripe artifacts. Simultaneously, we apply the sparse constraint on the reconstructed image to further rectified ring artifacts in the image domain. The key advantage of the proposed method lies in considering the relationship between the response inconsistency compensation coefficients of the detector units and the projection views, which enables a more accurate correction of the response of the detector units. An alternating minimization method is designed to solve the model. Comparative experiments on real photon counting detector data demonstrate that the proposed method not only surpasses existing methods in removing ring artifacts but also excels in preserving structural details and image fidelity.

- **Summary**: 3D scene stylization refers to transform the appearance of a 3D scene to match a given style image, ensuring that images rendered from different viewpoints exhibit the same style as the given style image, while maintaining the 3D consistency of the stylized scene. Several existing methods have obtained impressive results in stylizing 3D scenes. However, the models proposed by these methods need to be re-trained when applied to a new scene. In other words, their models are coupled with a specific scene and cannot adapt to arbitrary other scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel 3D scene stylization framework to transfer an arbitrary style to an arbitrary scene, without any style-related or scene-related re-training. Concretely, we first map the appearance of the 3D scene into a 2D style pattern space, which realizes complete disentanglement of the geometry and appearance of the 3D scene and makes our model be generalized to arbitrary 3D scenes. Then we stylize the appearance of the 3D scene in the 2D style pattern space via a prompt-based 2D stylization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to SOTA methods in both visual quality and generalization.

- **Summary**: Despite the rapid progress in image generation, emotional image editing remains under-explored. The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. For the first time, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce four new evaluation metrics to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images. All code, model, and data will be made public.

- **Summary**: In the realm of face image quality assesment (FIQA), method based on sample relative classification have shown impressive performance. However, the quality scores used as pseudo-labels assigned from images of classes with low intra-class variance could be unrelated to the actual quality in this method. To address this issue, we present IG-FIQA, a novel approach to guide FIQA training, introducing a weight parameter to alleviate the adverse impact of these classes. This method involves estimating sample intra-class variance at each iteration during training, ensuring minimal computational overhead and straightforward implementation. Furthermore, this paper proposes an on-the-fly data augmentation methodology for improved generalization performance in FIQA. On various benchmark datasets, our proposed method, IG-FIQA, achieved novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to exhibit remarkable performance and are widely used across many generative computer vision applications. However, the unprecedented demand for the deployment of GANs on resource-constrained edge devices still poses a challenge due to huge number of parameters involved in the generation process. This has led to focused attention on the area of compressing GANs. Most of the existing works use knowledge distillation with the overhead of teacher dependency. Moreover, there is no ability to control the degree of compression in these methods. Hence, we propose CoroNet-GAN for compressing GAN using the combined strength of differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks. The proposed method provides the advantage of performing controllable compression while training along with reducing training time by a substantial factor. Experiments have been done on various conditional GAN architectures (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN) to signify the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets such as Edges-to-Shoes, Horse-to-Zebra and Summer-to-Winter. The results obtained illustrate that our approach succeeds to outperform the baselines on Zebra-to-Horse and Summer-to-Winter achieving the best FID score of 32.3 and 72.3 respectively, yielding high-fidelity images across all the datasets. Additionally, our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in achieving better inference time on various smart-phone chipsets and data-types making it a feasible solution for deployment on edge devices.

- **Summary**: Creating personalized hand avatars is important to offer a realistic experience to users on AR / VR platforms. While most prior studies focused on reconstructing 3D hand shapes, some recent work has tackled the reconstruction of hand textures on top of shapes. However, these methods are often limited to capturing pixels on the visible side of a hand, requiring diverse views of the hand in a video or multiple images as input. In this paper, we propose a novel method, BiTT(Bi-directional Texture reconstruction of Two hands), which is the first end-to-end trainable method for relightable, pose-free texture reconstruction of two interacting hands taking only a single RGB image, by three novel components: 1)\ bi-directional (left $\leftrightarrow$ right) texture reconstruction using the texture symmetry of left / right hands, 2) utilizing a texture parametric model for hand texture recovery, and 3)\ the overall coarse-to-fine stage pipeline for reconstructing personalized texture of two interacting hands. BiTT first estimates the scene light condition and albedo image from an input image, then reconstructs the texture of both hands through the texture parametric model and bi-directional texture reconstructor. In experiments using InterHand2.6M and RGB2Hands datasets, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hand texture reconstruction methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: While manga is a popular entertainment form, creating manga is tedious, especially adding screentones to the created sketch, namely manga screening. Unfortunately, there is no existing method that tailors for automatic manga screening, probably due to the difficulty of generating high-quality shaded high-frequency screentones. The classic manga screening approaches generally require user input to provide screentone exemplars or a reference manga image. The recent deep learning models enables the automatic generation by learning from a large-scale dataset. However, the state-of-the-art models still fail to generate high-quality shaded screentones due to the lack of a tailored model and high-quality manga training data. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch-to-manga framework that first generates a color illustration from the sketch and then generates a screentoned manga based on the intensity guidance. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality manga with shaded high-frequency screentones.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in image-to-video generation, better controllability and local animation are less explored. Most existing image-to-video methods are not locally aware and tend to move the entire scene. However, human artists may need to control the movement of different objects or regions. Additionally, current I2V methods require users not only to describe the target motion but also to provide redundant detailed descriptions of frame contents. These two issues hinder the practical utilization of current I2V tools. In this paper, we propose a practical framework, named Follow-Your-Click, to achieve image animation with a simple user click (for specifying what to move) and a short motion prompt (for specifying how to move). Technically, we propose the first-frame masking strategy, which significantly improves the video generation quality, and a motion-augmented module equipped with a short motion prompt dataset to improve the short prompt following abilities of our model. To further control the motion speed, we propose flow-based motion magnitude control to control the speed of target movement more precisely. Our framework has simpler yet precise user control and better generation performance than previous methods. Extensive experiments compared with 7 baselines, including both commercial tools and research methods on 8 metrics, suggest the superiority of our approach.

- **Summary**: Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to accurately identify the target person in more realistic surveillance scenarios, where pedestrians usually change their clothing. Despite great progress, limited cloth-changing training samples in existing CC-ReID datasets still prevent the model from adequately learning cloth-irrelevant features. In addition, due to the absence of explicit supervision to keep the model constantly focused on cloth-irrelevant areas, existing methods are still hampered by the disruption of clothing variations. To solve the above issues, we propose an Identity-aware Dual-constraint Network (IDNet) for the CC-ReID task. Specifically, to help the model extract cloth-irrelevant clues, we propose a Clothes Diversity Augmentation (CDA), which generates more realistic cloth-changing samples by enriching the clothing color while preserving the texture. In addition, a Multi-scale Constraint Block (MCB) is designed, which extracts fine-grained identity-related features and effectively transfers cloth-irrelevant knowledge. Moreover, a Counterfactual-guided Attention Module (CAM) is presented, which learns cloth-irrelevant features from channel and space dimensions and utilizes the counterfactual intervention for supervising the attention map to highlight identity-related regions. Finally, a Semantic Alignment Constraint (SAC) is designed to facilitate high-level semantic feature interaction. Comprehensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets indicate that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing (RS-FGSC) poses a significant challenge due to the high similarity between classes and the limited availability of labeled data, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised classification methods. Recent advancements in large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot or zero-shot learning, particularly in understanding image content. This study delves into harnessing the potential of VLMs to enhance classification accuracy for unseen ship categories, which holds considerable significance in scenarios with restricted data due to cost or privacy constraints. Directly fine-tuning VLMs for RS-FGSC often encounters the challenge of overfitting the seen classes, resulting in suboptimal generalization to unseen classes, which highlights the difficulty in differentiating complex backgrounds and capturing distinct ship features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel prompt tuning technique that employs a hierarchical, multi-granularity prompt design. Our approach integrates remote sensing ship priors through bias terms, learned from a small trainable network. This strategy enhances the model's generalization capabilities while improving its ability to discern intricate backgrounds and learn discriminative ship features. Furthermore, we contribute to the field by introducing a comprehensive dataset, FGSCM-52, significantly expanding existing datasets with more extensive data and detailed annotations for less common ship classes. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art techniques. The source code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: In daily life and industrial production, it is crucial to accurately detect changes in liquid level in containers. Traditional contact measurement methods have some limitations, while emerging non-contact image processing technology shows good application prospects. This paper proposes a container dynamic liquid level detection model based on U^2-Net. This model uses the SAM model to generate an initial data set, and then evaluates and filters out high-quality pseudo-label images through the SemiReward framework to build an exclusive data set. The model uses U^2-Net to extract mask images of containers from the data set, and uses morphological processing to compensate for mask defects. Subsequently, the model calculates the grayscale difference between adjacent video frame images at the same position, segments the liquid level change area by setting a difference threshold, and finally uses a lightweight neural network to classify the liquid level state. This approach not only mitigates the impact of intricate surroundings, but also reduces the demand for training data, showing strong robustness and versatility. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively detect the dynamic liquid level changes of the liquid in the container, providing a novel and efficient solution for related fields.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based face recognition continues to face challenges due to its reliance on huge datasets obtained from web crawling, which can be costly to gather and raise significant real-world privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose VIGFace, a novel framework capable of generating synthetic facial images. Initially, we train the face recognition model using a real face dataset and create a feature space for both real and virtual IDs where virtual prototypes are orthogonal to other prototypes. Subsequently, we generate synthetic images by using the diffusion model based on the feature space. Our proposed framework provides two significant benefits. Firstly, it allows for creating virtual facial images without concerns about portrait rights, guaranteeing that the generated virtual face images are clearly differentiated from existing individuals. Secondly, it serves as an effective augmentation method by incorporating real existing images. Further experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, achieving state-of-the-art results from both perspectives without any external data.

- **Summary**: Materials and methods: First, a dual-time approach was assessed, for which the CNN was provided sequences of the MRI that initially depicted new MM (diagnosis MRI) as well as of a prediagnosis MRI: inclusion of only contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CNNdual_ce) was compared with inclusion of also the native T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and FLAIR sequences of both time points (CNNdual_all).Second, results were compared with the corresponding single time approaches, in which the CNN was provided exclusively the respective sequences of the diagnosis MRI.Casewise diagnostic performance parameters were calculated from 5-fold cross-validation.   Results: In total, 94 cases with 494 MMs were included. Overall, the highest diagnostic performance was achieved by inclusion of only the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the diagnosis and of a prediagnosis MRI (CNNdual_ce, sensitivity = 73%, PPV = 25%, F1-score = 36%). Using exclusively contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images as input resulted in significantly less false-positives (FPs) compared with inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (FPs = 5/7 for CNNdual_ce/CNNdual_all, P < 1e-5). Comparison of contrast-enhanced dual and mono time approaches revealed that exclusion of prediagnosis MRI significantly increased FPs (FPs = 5/10 for CNNdual_ce/CNNce, P < 1e-9).Approaches with only native sequences were clearly inferior to CNNs that were provided contrast-enhanced sequences.   Conclusions: Automated MM detection on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images performed with high sensitivity. Frequent FPs due to artifacts and vessels were significantly reduced by additional inclusion of prediagnosis MRI, but not by inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Future studies might investigate different change detection architectures for computer-aided detection.

- **Summary**: Navigating complex environments in Minecraft poses significant challenges for multi-agent systems due to the game's dynamic and unpredictable open-world setting. Agents need to interact with the environment and coordinate their actions with other agents to achieve common objectives. However, traditional approaches often struggle to efficiently manage inter-agent communication and task distribution, which are crucial for effective multi-agent navigation. Furthermore, processing and integrating multi-modal information (such as visual, textual, and auditory data) is essential for agents to fully comprehend their goals and navigate the environment successfully. To address this issue, we design the HAS framework to auto-organize groups of LLM-based agents to complete Navigation tasks. In our approach, we devise a hierarchical auto-organizing navigation system, which is characterized by 1) a hierarchical system for multi-agent organization, ensuring centralized planning and decentralized execution; 2) an auto-organizing and intra-communication mechanism, enabling dynamic group adjustment under subtasks; 3) a multi-modal information platform, facilitating multi-modal perception to perform the three navigation tasks with one system. To assess organizational behavior, we design a series of navigation tasks in the Minecraft environment, which includes searching and exploring. We aim to develop embodied organizations that push the boundaries of embodied AI, moving it towards a more human-like organizational structure.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly evolving landscape of transportation, the proliferation of automobiles has made road traffic more complex, necessitating advanced vision-assisted technologies for enhanced safety and navigation. These technologies are imperative for providing critical traffic sign information, influencing driver behavior, and supporting vehicle control, especially for drivers with disabilities and in the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles. Traffic sign detection and recognition have emerged as key areas of research due to their essential roles in ensuring road safety and compliance with traffic regulations. Traditional computer vision methods have faced challenges in achieving optimal accuracy and speed due to real-world variabilities. However, the advent of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized this domain, offering solutions that significantly surpass previous capabilities in terms of speed and reliability. This paper presents an innovative approach leveraging CNNs that achieves an accuracy of nearly 96\%, highlighting the potential for even greater precision through advanced localization techniques. Our findings not only contribute to the ongoing advancement of traffic sign recognition technology but also underscore the critical impact of these developments on road safety and the future of autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: As a new distributed computing framework that can protect data privacy, federated learning (FL) has attracted more and more attention in recent years. It receives gradients from users to train the global model and releases the trained global model to working users. Nonetheless, the gradient inversion (GI) attack reflects the risk of privacy leakage in federated learning. Attackers only need to use gradients through hundreds of thousands of simple iterations to obtain relatively accurate private data stored on users' local devices. For this, some works propose simple but effective strategies to obtain user data under a single-label dataset. However, these strategies induce a satisfactory visual effect of the inversion image at the expense of higher time costs. Due to the semantic limitation of a single label, the image obtained by gradient inversion may have semantic errors. We present a novel gradient inversion strategy based on canny edge detection (MGIC) in both the multi-label and single-label datasets. To reduce semantic errors caused by a single label, we add new convolution layers' blocks in the trained model to obtain the image's multi-label. Through multi-label representation, serious semantic errors in inversion images are reduced. Then, we analyze the impact of parameters on the difficulty of input image reconstruction and discuss how image multi-subjects affect the inversion performance. Our proposed strategy has better visual inversion image results than the most widely used ones, saving more than 78% of time costs in the ImageNet dataset.

- **Summary**: Existing generative adversarial network (GAN) based conditional image generative models typically produce fixed output for the same conditional input, which is unreasonable for highly subjective tasks, such as large-mask image inpainting or style transfer. On the other hand, GAN-based diverse image generative methods require retraining/fine-tuning the network or designing complex noise injection functions, which is computationally expensive, task-specific, or struggle to generate high-quality results. Given that many deterministic conditional image generative models have been able to produce high-quality yet fixed results, we raise an intriguing question: is it possible for pre-trained deterministic conditional image generative models to generate diverse results without changing network structures or parameters? To answer this question, we re-examine the conditional image generation tasks from the perspective of adversarial attack and propose a simple and efficient plug-in projected gradient descent (PGD) like method for diverse and controllable image generation. The key idea is attacking the pre-trained deterministic generative models by adding a micro perturbation to the input condition. In this way, diverse results can be generated without any adjustment of network structures or fine-tuning of the pre-trained models. In addition, we can also control the diverse results to be generated by specifying the attack direction according to a reference text or image. Our work opens the door to applying adversarial attack to low-level vision tasks, and experiments on various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: 4D style transfer aims at transferring arbitrary visual style to the synthesized novel views of a dynamic 4D scene with varying viewpoints and times. Existing efforts on 3D style transfer can effectively combine the visual features of style images and neural radiance fields (NeRF) but fail to handle the 4D dynamic scenes limited by the static scene assumption. Consequently, we aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style transfer. The experimental results show that our method not only renders 4D photorealistic style transfer results in a zero-shot manner but also outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.

- **Summary**: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has consistently been a focal point in the field of facial analysis. In the context of existing methodologies for 3D FER or 2D+3D FER, the extraction of expression features often gets entangled with identity information, compromising the distinctiveness of these features. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the innovative DrFER method, which brings the concept of disentangled representation learning to the field of 3D FER. DrFER employs a dual-branch framework to effectively disentangle expression information from identity information. Diverging from prior disentanglement endeavors in the 3D facial domain, we have carefully reconfigured both the loss functions and network structure to make the overall framework adaptable to point cloud data. This adaptation enhances the capability of the framework in recognizing facial expressions, even in cases involving varying head poses. Extensive evaluations conducted on the BU-3DFE and Bosphorus datasets substantiate that DrFER surpasses the performance of other 3D FER methods.

- **Summary**: Performing language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks in unstructured environments is highly demanded for general intelligent robots. Conventional robotic manipulation methods usually learn semantic representation of the observation for action prediction, which ignores the scene-level spatiotemporal dynamics for human goal completion. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Gaussian Splatting method named ManiGaussian for multi-task robotic manipulation, which mines scene dynamics via future scene reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that infers the semantics propagation in the Gaussian embedding space, where the semantic representation is leveraged to predict the optimal robot action. Then, we build a Gaussian world model to parameterize the distribution in our dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework, which provides informative supervision in the interactive environment via future scene reconstruction. We evaluate our ManiGaussian on 10 RLBench tasks with 166 variations, and the results demonstrate our framework can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 13.1\% in average success rate.

- **Summary**: The prevalence of convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) has markedly revolutionized the area of single-image super-resolution (SISR). To further boost the SR performances, several techniques, such as residual learning and attention mechanism, are introduced, which can be largely attributed to a wider range of activated area, that is, the input pixels that strongly influence the SR results. However, the possibility of further improving SR performance through another versatile vision backbone remains an unresolved challenge. To address this issue, in this paper, we unleash the representation potential of the modern state space model, i.e., Vision Mamba (Vim), in the context of SISR. Specifically, we present three recipes for better utilization of Vim-based models: 1) Integration into a MetaFormer-style block; 2) Pre-training on a larger and broader dataset; 3) Employing complementary attention mechanism, upon which we introduce the MMA. The resulting network MMA is capable of finding the most relevant and representative input pixels to reconstruct the corresponding high-resolution images. Comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that MMA not only achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art SISR methods but also maintains relatively low memory and computational overheads (e.g., +0.5 dB PSNR elevation on Manga109 dataset with 19.8 M parameters at the scale of 2). Furthermore, MMA proves its versatility in lightweight SR applications. Through this work, we aim to illuminate the potential applications of state space models in the broader realm of image processing rather than SISR, encouraging further exploration in this innovative direction.

- **Summary**: In various applications, such as virtual reality and gaming, simulating the deformation of soft tissues in the human body during interactions with external objects is essential. Traditionally, Finite Element Methods (FEM) have been employed for this purpose, but they tend to be slow and resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose a unified representation of human body shape and soft tissue with a data-driven simulator of non-rigid deformations. This approach enables rapid simulation of realistic interactions.   Our method builds upon the SMPL model, which generates human body shapes considering rigid transformations. We extend SMPL by incorporating a soft tissue layer and an intuitive representation of external forces applied to the body during object interactions. Specifically, we mapped the 3D body shape and soft tissue and applied external forces to 2D UV maps. Leveraging a UNET architecture designed for 2D data, our approach achieves high-accuracy inference in real time. Our experiment shows that our method achieves plausible deformation of the soft tissue layer, even for unseen scenarios.

- **Summary**: Instruction tuning represents a prevalent strategy employed by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to align with human instructions and adapt to new tasks. Nevertheless, MLLMs encounter the challenge of adapting to users' evolving knowledge and demands. Therefore, how to retain existing skills while acquiring new knowledge needs to be investigated. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark, namely Continual Instruction tuNing (CoIN), to assess existing MLLMs in the sequential instruction tuning paradigm. CoIN comprises 10 commonly used datasets spanning 8 task categories, ensuring a diverse range of instructions and tasks. Besides, the trained model is evaluated from two aspects: Instruction Following and General Knowledge, which assess the alignment with human intention and knowledge preserved for reasoning, respectively. Experiments on CoIN demonstrate that current powerful MLLMs still suffer catastrophic forgetting, and the failure in intention alignment assumes the main responsibility, instead of the knowledge forgetting. To this end, we introduce MoELoRA to MLLMs which is effective to retain the previous instruction alignment. Experimental results consistently illustrate the forgetting decreased from this method on CoIN.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is arguably the most important regularization technique commonly used to improve generalization performance of machine learning models. It primarily involves the application of appropriate data transformation operations to create new data samples with desired properties. Despite its effectiveness, the process is often challenging because of the time-consuming trial and error procedures for creating and testing different candidate augmentations and their hyperparameters manually. Automated data augmentation methods aim to automate the process. State-of-the-art approaches typically rely on automated machine learning (AutoML) principles. This work presents a comprehensive survey of AutoML-based data augmentation techniques. We discuss various approaches for accomplishing data augmentation with AutoML, including data manipulation, data integration and data synthesis techniques. We present extensive discussion of techniques for realizing each of the major subtasks of the data augmentation process: search space design, hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation. Finally, we carried out an extensive comparison and analysis of the performance of automated data augmentation techniques and state-of-the-art methods based on classical augmentation approaches. The results show that AutoML methods for data augmentation currently outperform state-of-the-art techniques based on conventional approaches.

- **Summary**: Enabling home-assistant robots to perceive and manipulate a diverse range of 3D objects based on human language instructions is a pivotal challenge. Prior research has predominantly focused on simplistic and task-oriented instructions, i.e., "Slide the top drawer open". However, many real-world tasks demand intricate multi-step reasoning, and without human instructions, these will become extremely difficult for robot manipulation. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark, NrVLM, comprising 15 distinct manipulation tasks, containing over 4500 episodes meticulously annotated with fine-grained language instructions. We split the long-term task process into several steps, with each step having a natural language instruction. Moreover, we propose a novel learning framework that completes the manipulation task step-by-step according to the fine-grained instructions. Specifically, we first identify the instruction to execute, taking into account visual observations and the end-effector's current state. Subsequently, our approach facilitates explicit learning through action-prompts and perception-prompts to promote manipulation-aware cross-modality alignment. Leveraging both visual observations and linguistic guidance, our model outputs a sequence of actionable predictions for manipulation, including contact points and end-effector poses. We evaluate our method and baselines using the proposed benchmark NrVLM. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Depth estimation is a fundamental knowledge for autonomous systems that need to assess their own state and perceive the surrounding environment. Deep learning algorithms for depth estimation have gained significant interest in recent years, owing to the potential benefits of this methodology in overcoming the limitations of active depth sensing systems. Moreover, due to the low cost and size of monocular cameras, researchers have focused their attention on monocular depth estimation (MDE), which consists in estimating a dense depth map from a single RGB video frame. State of the art MDE models typically rely on vision transformers (ViT) architectures that are highly deep and complex, making them unsuitable for fast inference on devices with hardware constraints. Purposely, in this paper, we address the problem of exploiting ViT in MDE on embedded devices. Those systems are usually characterized by limited memory capabilities and low-power CPU/GPU. We propose METER, a novel lightweight vision transformer architecture capable of achieving state of the art estimations and low latency inference performances on the considered embedded hardwares: NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and NVIDIA Jetson Nano. We provide a solution consisting of three alternative configurations of METER, a novel loss function to balance pixel estimation and reconstruction of image details, and a new data augmentation strategy to improve the overall final predictions. The proposed method outperforms previous lightweight works over the two benchmark datasets: the indoor NYU Depth v2 and the outdoor KITTI.

- **Summary**: Category imbalance is one of the most popular and important issues in the domain of classification. In this paper, we present a new generalized framework with Adaptive Weight function for soft-margin Weighted SVM (AW-WSVM), which aims to enhance the issue of imbalance and outlier sensitivity in standard support vector machine (SVM) for classifying two-class data. The weight coefficient is introduced into the unconstrained soft-margin support vector machines, and the sample weights are updated before each training. The Adaptive Weight function (AW function) is constructed from the distance between the samples and the decision hyperplane, assigning different weights to each sample. A weight update method is proposed, taking into account the proximity of the support vectors to the decision hyperplane. Before training, the weights of the corresponding samples are initialized according to different categories. Subsequently, the samples close to the decision hyperplane are identified and assigned more weights. At the same time, lower weights are assigned to samples that are far from the decision hyperplane. Furthermore, we also put forward an effective way to eliminate noise. To evaluate the strength of the proposed generalized framework, we conducted experiments on standard datasets and emotion classification datasets with different imbalanced ratios (IR). The experimental results prove that the proposed generalized framework outperforms in terms of accuracy, recall metrics and G-mean, validating the effectiveness of the weighted strategy provided in this paper in enhancing support vector machines.

- **Summary**: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) aims to segment small targets from infrared clutter background. Existing methods mainly focus on discriminative approaches, i.e., a pixel-level front-background binary segmentation. Since infrared small targets are small and low signal-to-clutter ratio, empirical risk has few disturbances when a certain false alarm and missed detection exist, which seriously affect the further improvement of such methods. Motivated by the dense prediction generative methods, in this paper, we propose a diffusion model framework for Infrared Small Target Detection which compensates pixel-level discriminant with mask posterior distribution modeling. Furthermore, we design a Low-frequency Isolation in the wavelet domain to suppress the interference of intrinsic infrared noise on the diffusion noise estimation. This transition from the discriminative paradigm to generative one enables us to bypass the target-level insensitivity. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets.

- **Summary**: Most diffusion models assume that the reverse process adheres to a Gaussian distribution. However, this approximation has not been rigorously validated, especially at singularities, where t=0 and t=1. Improperly dealing with such singularities leads to an average brightness issue in applications, and limits the generation of images with extreme brightness or darkness. We primarily focus on tackling singularities from both theoretical and practical perspectives. Initially, we establish the error bounds for the reverse process approximation, and showcase its Gaussian characteristics at singularity time steps. Based on this theoretical insight, we confirm the singularity at t=1 is conditionally removable while it at t=0 is an inherent property. Upon these significant conclusions, we propose a novel plug-and-play method SingDiffusion to address the initial singular time step sampling, which not only effectively resolves the average brightness issue for a wide range of diffusion models without extra training efforts, but also enhances their generation capability in achieving notable lower FID scores. Code and models are released at https://github.com/PangzeCheung/SingDiffusion.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) empowers privacy-preservation in model training by only exposing users' model gradients. Yet, FL users are susceptible to the gradient inversion (GI) attack which can reconstruct ground-truth training data such as images based on model gradients. However, reconstructing high-resolution images by existing GI attack works faces two challenges: inferior accuracy and slow-convergence, especially when the context is complicated, e.g., the training batch size is much greater than 1 on each FL user. To address these challenges, we present a Robust, Accurate and Fast-convergent GI attack algorithm, called RAF-GI, with two components: 1) Additional Convolution Block (ACB) which can restore labels with up to 20% improvement compared with existing works; 2) Total variance, three-channel mEan and cAnny edge detection regularization term (TEA), which is a white-box attack strategy to reconstruct images based on labels inferred by ACB. Moreover, RAF-GI is robust that can still accurately reconstruct ground-truth data when the users' training batch size is no more than 48. Our experimental results manifest that RAF-GI can diminish 94% time costs while achieving superb inversion quality in ImageNet dataset. Notably, with a batch size of 1, RAF-GI exhibits a 7.89 higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

- **Summary**: Moire pattern frequently appears in photographs captured with mobile devices and digital cameras, potentially degrading image quality. Despite recent advancements in computer vision, image demoire'ing remains a challenging task due to the dynamic textures and variations in colour, shape, and frequency of moire patterns. Most existing methods struggle to generalize to unseen datasets, limiting their effectiveness in removing moire patterns from real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight architecture, AADNet (Attention Aware Demoireing Network), for high-resolution image demoire'ing that effectively works across different frequency bands and generalizes well to unseen datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on the UHDM dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, resulting in high-fidelity images.

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust classification of diseases is important for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, medical datasets often face challenges related to limited sample sizes and inherent imbalanced distributions, due to difficulties in data collection and variations in disease prevalence across different types. In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Online Image Synthesis (IOIS) framework to address the class imbalance problem in medical image classification. Our framework incorporates two key modules, namely Online Image Synthesis (OIS) and Accuracy Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which collectively target the imbalance classification issue at both the instance level and the class level. The OIS module alleviates the data insufficiency problem by generating representative samples tailored for online training of the classifier. On the other hand, the AAS module dynamically balances the synthesized samples among various classes, targeting those with low training accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method in addressing imbalanced classification, we conduct experiments on the HAM10000 and APTOS datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods as well as the effectiveness of each component. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Machine-learning algorithms can facilitate low-cost, user-guided visual diagnostic platforms for addressing disparities in access to sexual health services. We developed a clinical image dataset using original and augmented images for five penile diseases: herpes eruption, syphilitic chancres, penile candidiasis, penile cancer, and genital warts. We used a U-net architecture model for semantic pixel segmentation into background or subject image, the Inception-ResNet version 2 neural architecture to classify each pixel as diseased or non-diseased, and a salience map using GradCAM++. We trained the model on a random 91% sample of the image database using 150 epochs per image, and evaluated the model on the remaining 9% of images, assessing recall (or sensitivity), precision, specificity, and F1-score (accuracy). Of the 239 images in the validation dataset, 45 (18.8%) were of genital warts, 43 (18.0%) were of HSV infection, 29 (12.1%) were of penile cancer, 40 (16.7%) were of penile candidiasis, 37 (15.5%) were of syphilitic chancres, and 45 (18.8%) were of non-diseased penises. The overall accuracy of the model for correctly classifying the diseased image was 0.944. Between July 1st and October 1st 2023, there were 2,640 unique users of the mobile platform. Among a random sample of submissions (n=437), 271 (62.0%) were from the United States, 64 (14.6%) from Singapore, 41 (9.4%) from Candia, 40 (9.2%) from the United Kingdom, and 21 (4.8%) from Vietnam. The majority (n=277 [63.4%]) were between 18 and 30 years old. We report on the development of a machine-learning model for classifying five penile diseases, which demonstrated excellent performance on a validation dataset. That model is currently in use globally and has the potential to improve access to diagnostic services for penile diseases.

- **Summary**: Industrial managements, including quality control, cost and safety optimization, etc., heavily rely on high quality industrial human action recognitions (IHARs) which were hard to be implemented in large-scale industrial scenes due to their high costs and poor real-time performance. In this paper, we proposed a large-scale foundation model(LSFM)-based IHAR method, wherein various LSFMs and lightweight methods were jointly used, for the first time, to fulfill low-cost dataset establishment and real-time IHARs. Comprehensive tests on in-situ large-scale industrial manufacturing lines elucidated that the proposed method realized great reduction on employment costs, superior real-time performance, and satisfactory accuracy and generalization capabilities, indicating its great potential as a backbone IHAR method, especially for large-scale industrial applications.

- **Summary**: The pre-trained vision-language model, exemplified by CLIP, advances zero-shot semantic segmentation by aligning visual features with class embeddings through a transformer decoder to generate semantic masks. Despite its effectiveness, prevailing methods within this paradigm encounter challenges, including overfitting on seen classes and small fragmentation in masks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Language-Driven Visual Consensus (LDVC) approach, fostering improved alignment of semantic and visual information.Specifically, we leverage class embeddings as anchors due to their discrete and abstract nature, steering vision features toward class embeddings. Moreover, to circumvent noisy alignments from the vision part due to its redundant nature, we introduce route attention into self-attention for finding visual consensus, thereby enhancing semantic consistency within the same object. Equipped with a vision-language prompting strategy, our approach significantly boosts the generalization capacity of segmentation models for unseen classes. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing mIoU gains of 4.5 on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and 3.6 on the COCO-Stuff 164k for unseen classes compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recent studies applied Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques (PEFTs) to efficiently narrow the performance gap between pre-training and downstream. There are two important factors for various PEFTs, namely, the accessible data size and fine-tunable parameter size. A natural expectation for PEFTs is that the performance of various PEFTs is positively related to the data size and fine-tunable parameter size. However, according to the evaluation of five PEFTs on two downstream vision-language (VL) tasks, we find that such an intuition holds only if the downstream data and task are not consistent with pre-training. For downstream fine-tuning consistent with pre-training, data size no longer affects the performance, while the influence of fine-tunable parameter size is not monotonous. We believe such an observation could guide the choice of training strategy for various PEFTs.

- **Summary**: Recent developments in face restoration have achieved remarkable results in producing high-quality and lifelike outputs. The stunning results however often fail to be faithful with respect to the identity of the person as the models lack necessary context. In this paper, we explore the potential of personalized face restoration with diffusion models. In our approach a restoration model is personalized using a few images of the identity, leading to tailored restoration with respect to the identity while retaining fine-grained details. By using independent trainable blocks for personalization, the rich prior of a base restoration model can be exploited to its fullest. To avoid the model relying on parts of identity left in the conditioning low-quality images, a generative regularizer is employed. With a learnable parameter, the model learns to balance between the details generated based on the input image and the degree of personalization. Moreover, we improve the training pipeline of face restoration models to enable an alignment-free approach. We showcase the robust capabilities of our approach in several real-world scenarios with multiple identities, demonstrating our method's ability to generate fine-grained details with faithful restoration. In the user study we evaluate the perceptual quality and faithfulness of the genereated details, with our method being voted best 61% of the time compared to the second best with 25% of the votes.

- **Summary**: Image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer target in-shop clothing to a dressed model image, the objectives of which are totally taking off original clothing while preserving the contents outside of the try-on area, naturally wearing target clothing and correctly inpainting the gap between target clothing and original clothing. Tremendous efforts have been made to facilitate this popular research area, but cannot keep the type of target clothing with the try-on area affected by original clothing. In this paper, we focus on the unpaired virtual try-on situation where target clothing and original clothing on the model are different, i.e., the practical scenario. To break the correlation between the try-on area and the original clothing and make the model learn the correct information to inpaint, we propose an adaptive mask training paradigm that dynamically adjusts training masks. It not only improves the alignment and fit of clothing but also significantly enhances the fidelity of virtual try-on experience. Furthermore, we for the first time propose two metrics for unpaired try-on evaluation, the Semantic-Densepose-Ratio (SDR) and Skeleton-LPIPS (S-LPIPS), to evaluate the correctness of clothing type and the accuracy of clothing texture. For unpaired try-on validation, we construct a comprehensive cross-try-on benchmark (Cross-27) with distinctive clothing items and model physiques, covering a broad try-on scenarios. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, contributing to the advancement of virtual try-on technology and offering new insights and tools for future research in the field. The code, model and benchmark will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry due to their capability to operate in extreme weather conditions. However, they face challenges in terms of sparsity and noise interference, which hinder their application in the field of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) autonomous navigation. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to dense and accurate mmWave radar point cloud construction via cross-modal learning. Specifically, we introduce diffusion models, which possess state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, to predict LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We also incorporate the most recent diffusion model inference accelerating techniques to ensure that the proposed method can be implemented on MAVs with limited computing resources.We validate the proposed method through extensive benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and generalization ability. Code and pretrained models will be available at https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Radar-Diffusion.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have advanced unsupervised anomaly detection by improving the transformation of pathological images into pseudo-healthy equivalents. Nonetheless, standard approaches may compromise critical information during pathology removal, leading to restorations that do not align with unaffected regions in the original scans. Such discrepancies can inadvertently increase false positive rates and reduce specificity, complicating radiological evaluations. This paper introduces Temporal Harmonization for Optimal Restoration (THOR), which refines the de-noising process by integrating implicit guidance through temporal anomaly maps. THOR aims to preserve the integrity of healthy tissue in areas unaffected by pathology. Comparative evaluations show that THOR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods in detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain MRIs and wrist X-rays. Code: https://github.com/ci-ber/THOR_DDPM.

- **Summary**: Conventional wisdom suggests parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models as the state-of-the-art method for transfer learning in vision, replacing the rich literature of alternatives such as meta-learning. In trying to harness the best of both worlds, meta-tuning introduces a subsequent optimization stage of foundation models but has so far only shown limited success and crucially tends to underperform on out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. In this paper, we introduce Sparse MetA-Tuning (SMAT), a method inspired by sparse mixture-of-experts approaches and trained to isolate subsets of pre-trained parameters automatically for meta-tuning on each task. SMAT successfully overcomes OOD sensitivity and delivers on the promise of enhancing the transfer abilities of vision foundation models beyond parameter-efficient finetuning. We establish new state-of-the-art results on a challenging combination of Meta-Dataset augmented with additional OOD tasks in both zero-shot and gradient-based adaptation settings. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of the superiority of learned over hand-designed sparsity patterns for sparse expert methods and the pivotal importance of the sparsity level in balancing between in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Radiation therapy is crucial in cancer treatment. Experienced experts typically iteratively generate high-quality dose distribution maps, forming the basis for excellent radiation therapy plans. Therefore, automated prediction of dose distribution maps is significant in expediting the treatment process and providing a better starting point for developing radiation therapy plans. With the remarkable results of diffusion models in predicting high-frequency regions of dose distribution maps, dose prediction methods based on diffusion models have been extensively studied. However, existing methods mainly utilize CNNs or Transformers as denoising networks. CNNs lack the capture of global receptive fields, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Transformers excel in global modeling but face quadratic complexity with image size, resulting in significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion model, MD-Dose, based on the Mamba architecture for predicting radiation therapy dose distribution in thoracic cancer patients. In the forward process, MD-Dose adds Gaussian noise to dose distribution maps to obtain pure noise images. In the backward process, MD-Dose utilizes a noise predictor based on the Mamba to predict the noise, ultimately outputting the dose distribution maps. Furthermore, We develop a Mamba encoder to extract structural information and integrate it into the noise predictor for localizing dose regions in the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Through extensive experiments on a dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients, we showcase the superiority of MD-Dose in various metrics and time consumption.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models pose risks of privacy breaches and copyright disputes, primarily stemming from the potential utilization of unauthorized data during the training phase. The Training Membership Inference (TMI) task aims to determine whether a specific sample has been used in the training process of a target model, representing a critical tool for privacy violation verification. However, the increased stochasticity inherent in diffusion renders traditional shadow-model-based or metric-based methods ineffective when applied to diffusion models. Moreover, existing methods only yield binary classification labels which lack necessary comprehensibility in practical applications. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective for the TMI task by leveraging the intrinsic generative priors within the diffusion model. Compared with unseen samples, training samples exhibit stronger generative priors within the diffusion model, enabling the successful reconstruction of substantially degraded training images. Consequently, we propose the Degrade Restore Compare (DRC) framework. In this framework, an image undergoes sequential degradation and restoration, and its membership is determined by comparing it with the restored counterpart. Experimental results verify that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy but also provides comprehensible decision criteria, offering evidence for potential privacy violations.

- **Summary**: Scene stylization extends the work of neural style transfer to three spatial dimensions. A vital challenge in this problem is to maintain the uniformity of the stylized appearance across a multi-view setting. A vast majority of the previous works achieve this by optimizing the scene with a specific style image. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture trained on a collection of style images, that at test time produces high quality stylized novel views. Our work builds up on the framework of 3D Gaussian splatting. For a given scene, we take the pretrained Gaussians and process them using a multi resolution hash grid and a tiny MLP to obtain the conditional stylised views. The explicit nature of 3D Gaussians give us inherent advantages over NeRF-based methods including geometric consistency, along with having a fast training and rendering regime. This enables our method to be useful for vast practical use cases such as in augmented or virtual reality applications. Through our experiments, we show our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance with superior visual quality on various indoor and outdoor real-world data.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there have been frequent incidents of foreign objects intruding into railway and Airport runways. These objects can include pedestrians, vehicles, animals, and debris. This paper introduces an improved YOLOv5 architecture incorporating FasterNet and attention mechanisms to enhance the detection of foreign objects on railways and Airport runways. This study proposes a new dataset, AARFOD (Aero and Rail Foreign Object Detection), which combines two public datasets for detecting foreign objects in aviation and railway systems.The dataset aims to improve the recognition capabilities of foreign object targets. Experimental results on this large dataset have demonstrated significant performance improvements of the proposed model over the baseline YOLOv5 model, reducing computational requirements.Improved YOLO model shows a significant improvement in precision by 1.2%, recall rate by 1.0%, and mAP@.5 by 0.6%, while mAP@.5-.95 remained unchanged. The parameters were reduced by approximately 25.12%, and GFLOPs were reduced by about 10.63%. In the ablation experiment, it is found that the FasterNet module can significantly reduce the number of parameters of the model, and the reference of the attention mechanism can slow down the performance loss caused by lightweight.

- **Summary**: Story Visualization (SV) is a challenging generative vision task, that requires both visual quality and consistency between different frames in generated image sequences. Previous approaches either employ some kind of memory mechanism to maintain context throughout an auto-regressive generation of the image sequence, or model the generation of the characters and their background separately, to improve the rendering of characters. On the contrary, we embrace a completely parallel transformer-based approach, exclusively relying on Cross-Attention with past and future captions to achieve consistency. Additionally, we propose a Character Guidance technique to focus on the generation of characters in an implicit manner, by forming a combination of text-conditional and character-conditional logits in the logit space. We also employ a caption-augmentation technique, carried out by a Large Language Model (LLM), to enhance the robustness of our approach. The combination of these methods culminates into state-of-the-art (SOTA) results over various metrics in the most prominent SV benchmark (Pororo-SV), attained with constraint resources while achieving superior computational complexity compared to previous arts. The validity of our quantitative results is supported by a human survey.

- **Summary**: Vision-based occupancy prediction, also known as 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, especially to increase the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner elevates vision-based SSC models to a level even surpassing that of LiDAR-based onboard SSC models.

- **Summary**: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.

- **Summary**: LiDAR-based 3D perception algorithms have evolved rapidly alongside the emergence of large datasets. Nonetheless, considerable performance degradation often ensues when models trained on a specific dataset are applied to other datasets or real-world scenarios with different LiDAR. This paper aims to develop a unified model capable of handling different LiDARs, enabling continual learning across diverse LiDAR datasets and seamless deployment across heterogeneous platforms. We observe that the gaps among datasets primarily manifest in geometric disparities (such as variations in beams and point counts) and semantic inconsistencies (taxonomy conflicts). To this end, this paper proposes UniLiDAR, an occupancy prediction pipeline that leverages geometric realignment and semantic label mapping to facilitate multiple datasets training and mitigate performance degradation during deployment on heterogeneous platforms. Moreover, our method can be easily combined with existing 3D perception models. The efficacy of the proposed approach in bridging LiDAR domain gaps is verified by comprehensive experiments on two prominent datasets: OpenOccupancy-nuScenes and SemanticKITTI. UniLiDAR elevates the mIoU of occupancy prediction by 15.7% and 12.5%, respectively, compared to the model trained on the directly merged dataset. Moreover, it outperforms several SOTA methods trained on individual datasets. We expect our research to facilitate further study of 3D generalization, the code will be available soon.

- **Summary**: The development of techniques that can be used to analyze and detect animal behavior is a crucial activity for the livestock sector, as it is possible to monitor the stress and animal welfare and contributes to decision making in the farm. Thus, the development of applications can assist breeders in making decisions to improve production performance and reduce costs, once the animal behavior is analyzed by humans and this can lead to susceptible errors and time consumption. Aggressiveness in pigs is an example of behavior that is studied to reduce its impact through animal classification and identification. However, this process is laborious and susceptible to errors, which can be reduced through automation by visually classifying videos captured in controlled environment. The captured videos can be used for training and, as a result, for classification through computer vision and artificial intelligence, employing neural network techniques. The main techniques utilized in this study are variants of transformers: STAM, TimeSformer, and ViViT, as well as techniques using convolutions, such as ResNet3D2, Resnet(2+1)D, and CnnLstm. These techniques were employed for pig video classification with the objective of identifying aggressive and non-aggressive behaviors. In this work, various techniques were compared to analyze the contribution of using transformers, in addition to the effectiveness of the convolution technique in video classification. The performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall. The TimerSformer technique showed the best results in video classification, with median accuracy of 0.729.

- **Summary**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are nowadays the model of choice in Computer Vision, thanks to their ability to automatize the feature extraction process in visual tasks. However, the knowledge acquired during training is fully subsymbolic, and hence difficult to understand and explain to end users. In this paper, we propose a new technique called HOLMES (HOLonym-MEronym based Semantic inspection) that decomposes a label into a set of related concepts, and provides component-level explanations for an image classification model. Specifically, HOLMES leverages ontologies, web scraping and transfer learning to automatically construct meronym (parts)-based detectors for a given holonym (class). Then, it produces heatmaps at the meronym level and finally, by probing the holonym CNN with occluded images, it highlights the importance of each part on the classification output. Compared to state-of-the-art saliency methods, HOLMES takes a step further and provides information about both where and what the holonym CNN is looking at, without relying on densely annotated datasets and without forcing concepts to be associated to single computational units. Extensive experimental evaluation on different categories of objects (animals, tools and vehicles) shows the feasibility of our approach. On average, HOLMES explanations include at least two meronyms, and the ablation of a single meronym roughly halves the holonym model confidence. The resulting heatmaps were quantitatively evaluated using the deletion/insertion/preservation curves. All metrics were comparable to those achieved by GradCAM, while offering the advantage of further decomposing the heatmap in human-understandable concepts, thus highlighting both the relevance of meronyms to object classification, as well as HOLMES ability to capture it.

- **Summary**: The evolution of Artificial Intelligence Generated Contents (AIGCs) is advancing towards higher quality. The growing interactions with AIGCs present a new challenge to the data-driven AI community: While AI-generated contents have played a crucial role in a wide range of AI models, the potential hidden risks they introduce have not been thoroughly examined. Beyond human-oriented forgery detection, AI-generated content poses potential issues for AI models originally designed to process natural data. In this study, we underscore the exacerbated hallucination phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) caused by AI-synthetic images. Remarkably, our findings shed light on a consistent AIGC \textbf{hallucination bias}: the object hallucinations induced by synthetic images are characterized by a greater quantity and a more uniform position distribution, even these synthetic images do not manifest unrealistic or additional relevant visual features compared to natural images. Moreover, our investigations on Q-former and Linear projector reveal that synthetic images may present token deviations after visual projection, thereby amplifying the hallucination bias.

- **Summary**: We introduce a conditional implicit neural atlas (CINA) for spatio-temporal atlas generation from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the neurotypical and pathological fetal brain, that is fully independent of affine or non-rigid registration. During training, CINA learns a general representation of the fetal brain and encodes subject specific information into latent code. After training, CINA can construct a faithful atlas with tissue probability maps of the fetal brain for any gestational age (GA) and anatomical variation covered within the training domain. Thus, CINA is competent to represent both, neurotypical and pathological brains. Furthermore, a trained CINA model can be fit to brain MRI of unseen subjects via test-time optimization of the latent code. CINA can then produce probabilistic tissue maps tailored to a particular subject. We evaluate our method on a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI of normal and abnormal fetal brains from the dHCP and FeTA datasets. We demonstrate CINA's capability to represent a fetal brain atlas that can be flexibly conditioned on GA and on anatomical variations like ventricular volume or degree of cortical folding, making it a suitable tool for modeling both neurotypical and pathological brains. We quantify the fidelity of our atlas by means of tissue segmentation and age prediction and compare it to an established baseline. CINA demonstrates superior accuracy for neurotypical brains and pathological brains with ventriculomegaly. Moreover, CINA scores a mean absolute error of 0.23 weeks in fetal brain age prediction, further confirming an accurate representation of fetal brain development.

- **Summary**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.

- **Summary**: The generalization of monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) has been a longstanding challenge. Recent methods made progress by combining relative and metric depth or aligning input image focal length. However, they are still beset by challenges in camera, scene, and data levels: (1) Sensitivity to different cameras; (2) Inconsistent accuracy across scenes; (3) Reliance on massive training data. This paper proposes SM4Depth, a seamless MMDE method, to address all the issues above within a single network. First, we reveal that a consistent field of view (FOV) is the key to resolve ``metric ambiguity'' across cameras, which guides us to propose a more straightforward preprocessing unit. Second, to achieve consistently high accuracy across scenes, we explicitly model the metric scale determination as discretizing the depth interval into bins and propose variation-based unnormalized depth bins. This method bridges the depth gap of diverse scenes by reducing the ambiguity of the conventional metric bin. Third, to reduce the reliance on massive training data, we propose a ``divide and conquer" solution. Instead of estimating directly from the vast solution space, the correct metric bins are estimated from multiple solution sub-spaces for complexity reduction. Finally, with just 150K RGB-D pairs and a consumer-grade GPU for training, SM4Depth achieves state-of-the-art performance on most previously unseen datasets, especially surpassing ZoeDepth and Metric3D on mRI$_\theta$.

- **Summary**: Cloth-changing person re-identification aims to retrieve and identify spe-cific pedestrians by using cloth-irrelevant features in person cloth-changing scenarios. However, pedestrian images captured by surveillance probes usually contain occlusions in real-world scenarios. The perfor-mance of existing cloth-changing re-identification methods is significantly degraded due to the reduction of discriminative cloth-irrelevant features caused by occlusion. We define cloth-changing person re-identification in occlusion scenarios as occluded cloth-changing person re-identification (Occ-CC-ReID), and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to pro-pose occluded cloth-changing person re-identification as a new task. We constructed two occluded cloth-changing person re-identification datasets for different occlusion scenarios: Occluded-PRCC and Occluded-LTCC. The datasets can be obtained from the following link: https://github.com/1024AILab/Occluded-Cloth-Changing-Person- Re-Identification.

- **Summary**: The storage of medical images is one of the challenges in the medical imaging field. There are variable works that use implicit neural representation (INR) to compress volumetric medical images. However, there is room to improve the compression rate for volumetric medical images. Most of the INR techniques need a huge amount of GPU memory and a long training time for high-quality medical volume rendering. In this paper, we present a novel implicit neural representation to compress volume data using our proposed architecture, that is, the Lanczos downsampling scheme, SIREN deep network, and SRDenseNet high-resolution scheme. Our architecture can effectively reduce training time, and gain a high compression rate while retaining the final rendering quality. Moreover, it can save GPU memory in comparison with the existing works. The experiments show that the quality of reconstructed images and training speed using our architecture is higher than current works which use the SIREN only. Besides, the GPU memory cost is evidently decreased

- **Summary**: Continual learning empowers models to adapt autonomously to the ever-changing environment or data streams without forgetting old knowledge. Prompt-based approaches are built on frozen pre-trained models to learn the task-specific prompts and classifiers efficiently. Existing prompt-based methods are inconsistent between training and testing, limiting their effectiveness. Two types of inconsistency are revealed. Test predictions are made from all classifiers while training only focuses on the current task classifier without holistic alignment, leading to Classifier inconsistency. Prompt inconsistency indicates that the prompt selected during testing may not correspond to the one associated with this task during training. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt-based method, Consistent Prompting (CPrompt), for more aligned training and testing. Specifically, all existing classifiers are exposed to prompt training, resulting in classifier consistency learning. In addition, prompt consistency learning is proposed to enhance prediction robustness and boost prompt selection accuracy. Our Consistent Prompting surpasses its prompt-based counterparts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple continual learning benchmarks. Detailed analysis shows that improvements come from more consistent training and testing.

- **Summary**: Classifying videos into distinct categories, such as Sport and Music Video, is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially when an immense volume of video content is being constantly generated. Traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage demands. Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream decoding. To validate our approach, we built a comprehensive data set comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. Our evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates consistently above 80%, many exceeding 90%, and some reaching 99%. The algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by seven orders of magnitude.

- **Summary**: Robustly estimating camera poses from a set of images is a fundamental task which remains challenging for differentiable methods, especially in the case of small and sparse camera pose graphs. To overcome this challenge, we propose Pose-refined Rotation Averaging Graph Optimization (PRAGO). From a set of objectness detections on unordered images, our method reconstructs the rotational pose, and in turn, the absolute pose, in a differentiable manner benefiting from the optimization of a sequence of geometrical tasks. We show how our objectness pose-refinement module in PRAGO is able to refine the inherent ambiguities in pairwise relative pose estimation without removing edges and avoiding making early decisions on the viability of graph edges. PRAGO then refines the absolute rotations through iterative graph construction, reweighting the graph edges to compute the final rotational pose, which can be converted into absolute poses using translation averaging. We show that PRAGO is able to outperform non-differentiable solvers on small and sparse scenes extracted from 7-Scenes achieving a relative improvement of 21% for rotations while achieving similar translation estimates.

- **Summary**: We present ActionDiffusion -- a novel diffusion model for procedure planning in instructional videos that is the first to take temporal inter-dependencies between actions into account in a diffusion model for procedure planning. This approach is in stark contrast to existing methods that fail to exploit the rich information content available in the particular order in which actions are performed. Our method unifies the learning of temporal dependencies between actions and denoising of the action plan in the diffusion process by projecting the action information into the noise space. This is achieved 1) by adding action embeddings in the noise masks in the noise-adding phase and 2) by introducing an attention mechanism in the noise prediction network to learn the correlations between different action steps. We report extensive experiments on three instructional video benchmark datasets (CrossTask, Coin, and NIV) and show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all metrics on CrossTask and NIV and all metrics except accuracy on Coin dataset. We show that by adding action embeddings into the noise mask the diffusion model can better learn action temporal dependencies and increase the performances on procedure planning.

- **Summary**: Confronting the challenges of data scarcity and advanced motion synthesis in human-scene interaction modeling, we introduce the TRUMANS dataset alongside a novel HSI motion synthesis method. TRUMANS stands as the most comprehensive motion-captured HSI dataset currently available, encompassing over 15 hours of human interactions across 100 indoor scenes. It intricately captures whole-body human motions and part-level object dynamics, focusing on the realism of contact. This dataset is further scaled up by transforming physical environments into exact virtual models and applying extensive augmentations to appearance and motion for both humans and objects while maintaining interaction fidelity. Utilizing TRUMANS, we devise a diffusion-based autoregressive model that efficiently generates HSI sequences of any length, taking into account both scene context and intended actions. In experiments, our approach shows remarkable zero-shot generalizability on a range of 3D scene datasets (e.g., PROX, Replica, ScanNet, ScanNet++), producing motions that closely mimic original motion-captured sequences, as confirmed by quantitative experiments and human studies.

- **Summary**: We revisit the "dataset classification" experiment suggested by Torralba and Efros a decade ago, in the new era with large-scale, diverse, and hopefully less biased datasets as well as more capable neural network architectures. Surprisingly, we observe that modern neural networks can achieve excellent accuracy in classifying which dataset an image is from: e.g., we report 84.7% accuracy on held-out validation data for the three-way classification problem consisting of the YFCC, CC, and DataComp datasets. Our further experiments show that such a dataset classifier could learn semantic features that are generalizable and transferable, which cannot be simply explained by memorization. We hope our discovery will inspire the community to rethink the issue involving dataset bias and model capabilities.

- **Summary**: Vectorized High-Definition (HD) map construction requires predictions of the category and point coordinates of map elements (e.g. road boundary, lane divider, pedestrian crossing, etc.). State-of-the-art methods are mainly based on point-level representation learning for regressing accurate point coordinates. However, this pipeline has limitations in obtaining element-level information and handling element-level failures, e.g. erroneous element shape or entanglement between elements. To tackle the above issues, we propose a simple yet effective HybrId framework named HIMap to sufficiently learn and interact both point-level and element-level information. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid representation called HIQuery to represent all map elements, and propose a point-element interactor to interactively extract and encode the hybrid information of elements, e.g. point position and element shape, into the HIQuery. Additionally, we present a point-element consistency constraint to enhance the consistency between the point-level and element-level information. Finally, the output point-element integrated HIQuery can be directly converted into map elements' class, point coordinates, and mask. We conduct extensive experiments and consistently outperform previous methods on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Notably, our method achieves $77.8$ mAP on the nuScenes dataset, remarkably superior to previous SOTAs by $8.3$ mAP at least.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present a complete refractive Structure-from-Motion (RSfM) framework for underwater 3D reconstruction using refractive camera setups (for both, flat- and dome-port underwater housings). Despite notable achievements in refractive multi-view geometry over the past decade, a robust, complete and publicly available solution for such tasks is not available at present, and often practical applications have to resort to approximating refraction effects by the intrinsic (distortion) parameters of a pinhole camera model. To fill this gap, we have integrated refraction considerations throughout the entire SfM process within the state-of-the-art, open-source SfM framework COLMAP. Numerical simulations and reconstruction results on synthetically generated but photo-realistic images with ground truth validate that enabling refraction does not compromise accuracy or robustness as compared to in-air reconstructions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for large-scale refractive scenarios using a dataset consisting of nearly 6000 images. The implementation is released as open-source at: https://cau-git.rz.uni-kiel.de/inf-ag-koeser/colmap_underwater.

- **Summary**: Learning domain-invariant semantic representations is crucial for achieving domain generalization (DG), where a model is required to perform well on unseen target domains. One critical challenge is that standard training often results in entangled semantic and domain-specific features. Previous works suggest formulating the problem from a causal perspective and solving the entanglement problem by enforcing marginal independence between the causal (\ie semantic) and non-causal (\ie domain-specific) features. Despite its simplicity, the basic marginal independent-based idea alone may be insufficient to identify the causal feature. By d-separation, we observe that the causal feature can be further characterized by being independent of the domain conditioned on the object, and we propose the following two strategies as complements for the basic framework.   First, the observation implicitly implies that for the same object, the causal feature should not be associated with the non-causal feature, revealing that the common practice of obtaining the two features with a shared base feature extractor and two lightweight prediction heads might be inappropriate. To meet the constraint, we propose a simple early-branching structure, where the causal and non-causal feature obtaining branches share the first few blocks while diverging thereafter, for better structure design; Second, the observation implies that the causal feature remains invariant across different domains for the same object. To this end, we suggest that augmentation should be incorporated into the framework to better characterize the causal feature, and we further suggest an effective random domain sampling scheme to fulfill the task. Theoretical and experimental results show that the two strategies are beneficial for the basic marginal independent-based framework.

- **Summary**: This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of data augmentation techniques in human-centric vision tasks, a first of its kind in the field. It delves into a wide range of research areas including person ReID, human parsing, human pose estimation, and pedestrian detection, addressing the significant challenges posed by overfitting and limited training data in these domains. Our work categorizes data augmentation methods into two main types: data generation and data perturbation. Data generation covers techniques like graphic engine-based generation, generative model-based generation, and data recombination, while data perturbation is divided into image-level and human-level perturbations. Each method is tailored to the unique requirements of human-centric tasks, with some applicable across multiple areas. Our contributions include an extensive literature review, providing deep insights into the influence of these augmentation techniques in human-centric vision and highlighting the nuances of each method. We also discuss open issues and future directions, such as the integration of advanced generative models like Latent Diffusion Models, for creating more realistic and diverse training data. This survey not only encapsulates the current state of data augmentation in human-centric vision but also charts a course for future research, aiming to develop more robust, accurate, and efficient human-centric vision systems.

- **Summary**: In the realm of fashion design, sketches serve as the canvas for expressing an artist's distinctive drawing style and creative vision, capturing intricate details like stroke variations and texture nuances. The advent of sketch-to-image cross-modal translation technology has notably aided designers. However, existing methods often compromise these sketch details during image generation, resulting in images that deviate from the designer's intended concept. This limitation hampers the ability to offer designers a precise preview of the final output. To overcome this challenge, we introduce HAIFIT, a novel approach that transforms sketches into high-fidelity, lifelike clothing images by integrating multi-scale features and capturing extensive feature map dependencies from diverse perspectives. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on our self-collected dataset, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in generating photorealistic clothing images. Our method excels in preserving the distinctive style and intricate details essential for fashion design applications.

- **Summary**: Contemporary Video Object Segmentation (VOS) approaches typically consist stages of feature extraction, matching, memory management, and multiple objects aggregation. Recent advanced models either employ a discrete modeling for these components in a sequential manner, or optimize a combined pipeline through substructure aggregation. However, these existing explicit staged approaches prevent the VOS framework from being optimized as a unified whole, leading to the limited capacity and suboptimal performance in tackling complex videos. In this paper, we propose OneVOS, a novel framework that unifies the core components of VOS with All-in-One Transformer. Specifically, to unify all aforementioned modules into a vision transformer, we model all the features of frames, masks and memory for multiple objects as transformer tokens, and integrally accomplish feature extraction, matching and memory management of multiple objects through the flexible attention mechanism. Furthermore, a Unidirectional Hybrid Attention is proposed through a double decoupling of the original attention operation, to rectify semantic errors and ambiguities of stored tokens in OneVOS framework. Finally, to alleviate the storage burden and expedite inference, we propose the Dynamic Token Selector, which unveils the working mechanism of OneVOS and naturally leads to a more efficient version of OneVOS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OneVOS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 7 datasets, particularly excelling in complex LVOS and MOSE datasets with 70.1% and 66.4% $J \& F$ scores, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 4.2% and 7.0%, respectively. And our code will be available for reproducibility and further research.

- **Summary**: Radiography imaging protocols focus on particular body regions, therefore producing images of great similarity and yielding recurrent anatomical structures across patients. Exploiting this structured information could potentially ease the detection of anomalies from radiography images. To this end, we propose a Simple Space-Aware Memory Matrix for In-painting and Detecting anomalies from radiography images (abbreviated as SimSID). We formulate anomaly detection as an image reconstruction task, consisting of a space-aware memory matrix and an in-painting block in the feature space. During the training, SimSID can taxonomize the ingrained anatomical structures into recurrent visual patterns, and in the inference, it can identify anomalies (unseen/modified visual patterns) from the test image. Our SimSID surpasses the state of the arts in unsupervised anomaly detection by +8.0%, +5.0%, and +9.9% AUC scores on ZhangLab, COVIDx, and CheXpert benchmark datasets, respectively.

- **Summary**: This article explores the latest Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud detection aboard hyperspectral satellites. The performance of the latest 1D CNN (1D-Justo-LiuNet) and two recent 2D CNNs (nnU-net and 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple) for cloud segmentation and classification is assessed. Evaluation criteria include precision and computational efficiency for in-orbit deployment. Experiments utilize NASA's EO-1 Hyperion data, with varying spectral channel numbers after Principal Component Analysis. Results indicate that 1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming 2D CNNs, while maintaining compactness with larger spectral channel sets, albeit with increased inference times. However, the performance of 1D CNN degrades with significant channel reduction. In this context, the 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple offers the best balance for in-orbit deployment, considering precision, memory, and time costs. While nnU-net is suitable for on-ground processing, deployment of lightweight 1D-Justo-LiuNet is recommended for high-precision applications. Alternatively, lightweight 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple is recommended for balanced costs between timing and precision in orbit.

- **Summary**: Obstetric ultrasound image quality is crucial for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of fetal health. However, producing high-quality standard planes is difficult, influenced by the sonographer's expertise and factors like the maternal BMI or the fetus dynamics. In this work, we propose using diffusion-based counterfactual explainable AI to generate realistic high-quality standard planes from low-quality non-standard ones. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing plausible counterfactuals of increased quality. This shows future promise both for enhancing training of clinicians by providing visual feedback, as well as for improving image quality and, consequently, downstream diagnosis and monitoring.

- **Summary**: Automatically extracting the geometric content from the hundreds of thousands of diagrams drawn in historical manuscripts would enable historians to study the diffusion of astronomical knowledge on a global scale. However, state-of-the-art vectorization methods, often designed to tackle modern data, are not adapted to the complexity and diversity of historical astronomical diagrams. Our contribution is thus twofold. First, we introduce a unique dataset of 303 astronomical diagrams from diverse traditions, ranging from the XIIth to the XVIIIth century, annotated with more than 3000 line segments, circles and arcs. Second, we develop a model that builds on DINO-DETR to enable the prediction of multiple geometric primitives. We show that it can be trained solely on synthetic data and accurately predict primitives on our challenging dataset. Our approach widely improves over the LETR baseline, which is restricted to lines, by introducing a meaningful parametrization for multiple primitives, jointly training for detection and parameter refinement, using deformable attention and training on rich synthetic data. Our dataset and code are available on our webpage.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We provide a framework for solving inverse problems with diffusion models learned from linearly corrupted data. Our method, Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), leverages a generative model pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling conditioned on measurements from a potentially different forward process (e.g. image blurring). We test the efficacy of our approach on standard natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and we show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance. We further extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to train MRI models with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil MRI measurements at various acceleration factors (R=2, 4, 6, 8). We again observe that models trained on highly subsampled data are better priors for solving inverse problems in the high acceleration regime than models trained on fully sampled data. We open-source our code and the trained Ambient Diffusion MRI models: https://github.com/utcsilab/ambient-diffusion-mri .

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in generating responses based on visual inputs. However, they often suffer from a bias towards generating responses similar to their pretraining corpus, overshadowing the importance of visual information. We treat this bias as a "preference" for pretraining statistics, which hinders the model's grounding in visual input. To mitigate this issue, we propose Bootstrapped Preference Optimization (BPO), which conducts preference learning with datasets containing negative responses bootstrapped from the model itself. Specifically, we propose the following two strategies: 1) using distorted image inputs to the MLLM for eliciting responses that contain signified pretraining bias; 2) leveraging text-based LLM to explicitly inject erroneous but common elements into the original response. Those undesirable responses are paired with original annotated responses from the datasets to construct the preference dataset, which is subsequently utilized to perform preference learning. Our approach effectively suppresses pretrained LLM bias, enabling enhanced grounding in visual inputs. Extensive experimentation demonstrates significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, advancing the state-of-the-art in multimodal conversational systems.

- **Summary**: We propose GaussCtrl, a text-driven method to edit a 3D scene reconstructed by the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).   Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model.   Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the 3D model as in previous works.   It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.   This is achieved by the two terms:   (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.   (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.   Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Creating thematic collections in industries demands innovative designs and cohesive concepts. Designers may face challenges in maintaining thematic consistency when drawing inspiration from existing objects, landscapes, or artifacts. While AI-powered graphic design tools offer help, they often fail to generate cohesive sets based on specific thematic concepts. In response, we introduce iCONTRA, an interactive CONcept TRAnsfer system. With a user-friendly interface, iCONTRA enables both experienced designers and novices to effortlessly explore creative design concepts and efficiently generate thematic collections. We also propose a zero-shot image editing algorithm, eliminating the need for fine-tuning models, which gradually integrates information from initial objects, ensuring consistency in the generation process without influencing the background. A pilot study suggests iCONTRA's potential to reduce designers' efforts. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in producing consistent and high-quality object concept transfers. iCONTRA stands as a promising tool for innovation and creative exploration in thematic collection design.

- **Summary**: In autonomous vehicles, understanding the surrounding 3D environment of the ego vehicle in real-time is essential. A compact way to represent scenes while encoding geometric distances and semantic object information is via 3D semantic occupancy maps. State of the art 3D mapping methods leverage transformers with cross-attention mechanisms to elevate 2D vision-centric camera features into the 3D domain. However, these methods encounter significant challenges in real-time applications due to their high computational demands during inference. This limitation is particularly problematic in autonomous vehicles, where GPU resources must be shared with other tasks such as localization and planning. In this paper, we introduce an approach that extracts features from front-view 2D camera images and LiDAR scans, then employs a sparse convolution network (Minkowski Engine), for 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Given that outdoor scenes in autonomous driving scenarios are inherently sparse, the utilization of sparse convolution is particularly apt. By jointly solving the problems of 3D scene completion of sparse scenes and 3D semantic segmentation, we provide a more efficient learning framework suitable for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. We also demonstrate competitive accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.

- **Summary**: The currently limited quality of accelerated cardiac cine reconstruction may potentially be improved by the emerging diffusion models, but the clinically unacceptable long processing time poses a challenge. We aim to develop a clinically feasible diffusion-model-based reconstruction pipeline to improve the image quality of cine MRI. A multi-in multi-out diffusion enhancement model together with fast inference strategies were developed to be used in conjunction with a reconstruction model. The diffusion reconstruction reduced spatial and temporal blurring in prospectively undersampled clinical data, as validated by experts inspection. The 1.5s per video processing time enabled the approach to be applied in clinical scenarios.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We present a parameter-efficient method for continual video question-answering (VidQA) learning. Our method, named DAM, uses the proposed Dynamic Adapter Merging to (i) mitigate catastrophic forgetting, (ii) enable efficient adaptation to continually arriving datasets, (iii) handle inputs from unknown datasets during inference, and (iv) enable knowledge sharing across similar dataset domains. Given a set of continually streaming VidQA datasets, we sequentially train dataset-specific adapters for each dataset while freezing the parameters of a large pretrained video-language backbone. During inference, given a video-question sample from an unknown domain, our method first uses the proposed non-parametric router function to compute a probability for each adapter, reflecting how relevant that adapter is to the current video-question input instance. Subsequently, the proposed dynamic adapter merging scheme aggregates all the adapter weights into a new adapter instance tailored for that particular test sample to compute the final VidQA prediction, mitigating the impact of inaccurate router predictions and facilitating knowledge sharing across domains. Our DAM model outperforms prior state-of-the-art continual learning approaches by 9.1% while exhibiting 1.9% less forgetting on 6 VidQA datasets spanning various domains. We further extend DAM to continual image classification and image QA and outperform prior methods by a large margin. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/klauscc/DAM

The diffusion model provided sharper tissue boundaries and clearer motion than the original reconstruction in experts evaluation on clinical data. The innovative paired sampling strategy substantially reduced artificial noises in the generative results.

- **Summary**: Learning robust and scalable visual representations from massive multi-view video data remains a challenge in computer vision and autonomous driving. Existing pre-training methods either rely on expensive supervised learning with 3D annotations, limiting the scalability, or focus on single-frame or monocular inputs, neglecting the temporal information. We propose MIM4D, a novel pre-training paradigm based on dual masked image modeling (MIM). MIM4D leverages both spatial and temporal relations by training on masked multi-view video inputs. It constructs pseudo-3D features using continuous scene flow and projects them onto 2D plane for supervision. To address the lack of dense 3D supervision, MIM4D reconstruct pixels by employing 3D volumetric differentiable rendering to learn geometric representations. We demonstrate that MIM4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset for visual representation learning in autonomous driving. It significantly improves existing methods on multiple downstream tasks, including BEV segmentation (8.7% IoU), 3D object detection (3.5% mAP), and HD map construction (1.4% mAP). Our work offers a new choice for learning representation at scale in autonomous driving. Code and models are released at https://github.com/hustvl/MIM4D

- **Summary**: Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that induces chronic pain and disability. Bone morphological analysis is a promising tool to understand the mechanical aspect of this disorder. This study proposes a 2D bone morphological analysis using manually segmented bones to explore morphological features related to distinct pain conditions. Furthermore, six semantic segmentation algorithms are assessed for extracting femur and tibia bones from X-ray images. Our analysis reveals that the morphology of the femur undergoes significant changes in instances where pain worsens. Conversely, improvements in pain may not manifest pronounced alterations in bone shape. The few-shot-learning-based algorithm, UniverSeg, demonstrated superior segmentation results with Dice scores of 99.69% for femur and 99.60% for tibia. Regarding pain condition classification, the zero-shot-learning-based algorithm, CP-SAM, achieved the highest accuracy at 66% among all models. UniverSeg is recommended for automatic knee bone segmentation, while SAM models show potential with prompt encoder modifications for optimized outcomes. These findings highlight the effectiveness of few-shot learning for semantic segmentation and the potential of zero-shot learning in enhancing classification models for knee osteoarthritis diagnosis.

- **Summary**: We propose VLOGGER, a method for audio-driven human video generation from a single input image of a person, which builds on the success of recent generative diffusion models. Our method consists of 1) a stochastic human-to-3d-motion diffusion model, and 2) a novel diffusion-based architecture that augments text-to-image models with both spatial and temporal controls. This supports the generation of high quality video of variable length, easily controllable through high-level representations of human faces and bodies. In contrast to previous work, our method does not require training for each person, does not rely on face detection and cropping, generates the complete image (not just the face or the lips), and considers a broad spectrum of scenarios (e.g. visible torso or diverse subject identities) that are critical to correctly synthesize humans who communicate. We also curate MENTOR, a new and diverse dataset with 3d pose and expression annotations, one order of magnitude larger than previous ones (800,000 identities) and with dynamic gestures, on which we train and ablate our main technical contributions.   VLOGGER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three public benchmarks, considering image quality, identity preservation and temporal consistency while also generating upper-body gestures. We analyze the performance of VLOGGER with respect to multiple diversity metrics, showing that our architectural choices and the use of MENTOR benefit training a fair and unbiased model at scale. Finally we show applications in video editing and personalization.

- **Summary**: Monocular Semantic Occupancy Prediction aims to infer the complete 3D geometry and semantic information of scenes from only 2D images. It has garnered significant attention, particularly due to its potential to enhance the 3D perception of autonomous vehicles. However, existing methods rely on a complex cascaded framework with relatively limited information to restore 3D scenes, including a dependency on supervision solely on the whole network's output, single-frame input, and the utilization of a small backbone. These challenges, in turn, hinder the optimization of the framework and yield inferior prediction results, particularly concerning smaller and long-tailed objects. To address these issues, we propose MonoOcc. In particular, we (i) improve the monocular occupancy prediction framework by proposing an auxiliary semantic loss as supervision to the shallow layers of the framework and an image-conditioned cross-attention module to refine voxel features with visual clues, and (ii) employ a distillation module that transfers temporal information and richer knowledge from a larger image backbone to the monocular semantic occupancy prediction framework with low cost of hardware. With these advantages, our method yields state-of-the-art performance on the camera-based SemanticKITTI Scene Completion benchmark.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces 3DFIRES, a novel system for scene-level 3D reconstruction from posed images. Designed to work with as few as one view, 3DFIRES reconstructs the complete geometry of unseen scenes, including hidden surfaces. With multiple view inputs, our method produces full reconstruction within all camera frustums. A key feature of our approach is the fusion of multi-view information at the feature level, enabling the production of coherent and comprehensive 3D reconstruction. We train our system on non-watertight scans from large-scale real scene dataset. We show it matches the efficacy of single-view reconstruction methods with only one input and surpasses existing techniques in both quantitative and qualitative measures for sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: 3D correspondence, i.e., a pair of 3D points, is a fundamental concept in computer vision. A set of 3D correspondences, when equipped with compatibility edges, forms a correspondence graph. This graph is a critical component in several state-of-the-art 3D point cloud registration approaches, e.g., the one based on maximal cliques (MAC). However, its properties have not been well understood. So we present the first study that introduces graph signal processing into the domain of correspondence graph. We exploit the generalized degree signal on correspondence graph and pursue sampling strategies that preserve high-frequency components of this signal. To address time-consuming singular value decomposition in deterministic sampling, we resort to a stochastic approximate sampling strategy. As such, the core of our method is the stochastic spectral sampling of correspondence graph. As an application, we build a complete 3D registration algorithm termed as FastMAC, that reaches real-time speed while leading to little to none performance drop. Through extensive experiments, we validate that FastMAC works for both indoor and outdoor benchmarks. For example, FastMAC can accelerate MAC by 80 times while maintaining high registration success rate on KITTI. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Forrest-110/FastMAC.

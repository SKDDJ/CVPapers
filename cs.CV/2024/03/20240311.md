- **Summary**: Brain tumors are an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. They can be classified into distinct grades based on their growth. Often grading is performed based on a histological image and is one of the most significant predictors of a patients prognosis, the higher the grade, the more aggressive the tumor. Correct diagnosis of a tumor grade remains challenging. Though histopathological grading has been shown to be prognostic, results are subject to interobserver variability, even among experienced pathologists. Recently, the World Health Organization reported that advances in molecular genetics have led to improvements in tumor classification. This paper seeks to integrate histological images and genetic data for improved computer-aided diagnosis. We propose a novel Multi-modal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB) based on arithmetic operations to combine latent representations of the different modalities for predicting the tumor grade (Grade \rom{2}, \rom{3} and \rom{4}). Extensive experiments evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. By applying MOAB to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) glioma dataset, we show that it can improve separation between similar classes (Grade \rom{2} and \rom{3}) and outperform prior state-of-the-art grade classification techniques.

- **Summary**: We investigate exocentric-to-egocentric cross-view translation, which aims to generate a first-person (egocentric) view of an actor based on a video recording that captures the actor from a third-person (exocentric) perspective. To this end, we propose a generative framework called Exo2Ego that decouples the translation process into two stages: high-level structure transformation, which explicitly encourages cross-view correspondence between exocentric and egocentric views, and a diffusion-based pixel-level hallucination, which incorporates a hand layout prior to enhance the fidelity of the generated egocentric view. To pave the way for future advancements in this field, we curate a comprehensive exo-to-ego cross-view translation benchmark. It consists of a diverse collection of synchronized ego-exo tabletop activity video pairs sourced from three public datasets: H2O, Aria Pilot, and Assembly101. The experimental results validate that Exo2Ego delivers photorealistic video results with clear hand manipulation details and outperforms several baselines in terms of both synthesis quality and generalization ability to new actions.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore how to design lightweight CNN architecture for embedded computing systems. We propose L-Mobilenet model for ZYNQ based hardware platform. L-Mobilenet can adapt well to the hardware computing and accelerating, and its network structure is inspired by the state-of-the-art work of Inception-ResnetV1 and MobilenetV2, which can effectively reduce parameters and delay while maintaining the accuracy of inference. We deploy our L-Mobilenet model to ZYNQ embedded platform for fully evaluating the performance of our design. By measuring in cifar10 and cifar100 datasets, L-Mobilenet model is able to gain 3x speed up and 3.7x fewer parameters than MobileNetV2 while maintaining a similar accuracy. It also can obtain 2x speed up and 1.5x fewer parameters than ShufflenetV2 while maintaining the same accuracy. Experiments show that our network model can obtain better performance because of the special considerations for hardware accelerating and software-hardware co-design strategies in our L-Mobilenet bottleneck architecture.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal semantic understanding requires integrating information from different modalities to extract users' real intention behind words. Most previous work applies a dual-encoder structure to separately encode image and text, but fails to learn cross-modal feature alignment, making it hard to achieve cross-modal deep information interaction. This paper proposes a novel CLIP-guided contrastive-learning-based architecture to perform multi-modal feature alignment, which projects the features derived from different modalities into a unified deep space. On multi-modal sarcasm detection (MMSD) and multi-modal sentiment analysis (MMSA) tasks, the experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms several baselines, and our feature alignment strategy brings obvious performance gain over models with different aggregating methods and models even enriched with knowledge. More importantly, our model is simple to implement without using task-specific external knowledge, and thus can easily migrate to other multi-modal tasks.

- **Summary**: Currently, various studies have been exploring generation of long videos. However, the generated frames in these videos often exhibit jitter and noise. Therefore, in order to generate the videos without these noise, we propose a novel framework composed of four modules: separate tuning module, average fusion module, combined tuning module, and inter-frame consistency module. By applying our newly proposed modules subsequently, the consistency of the background and foreground in each video frames is optimized. Besides, the experimental results demonstrate that videos generated by our method exhibit a high quality in comparison of the state-of-the-art methods.

  data
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Deciphering visual content from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) helps illuminate the human vision system. However, the scarcity of fMRI data and noise hamper brain decoding model performance. Previous approaches primarily employ subject-specific models, sensitive to training sample size. In this paper, we explore a straightforward but overlooked solution to address data scarcity. We propose shallow subject-specific adapters to map cross-subject fMRI data into unified representations. Subsequently, a shared deeper decoding model decodes cross-subject features into the target feature space. During training, we leverage both visual and textual supervision for multi-modal brain decoding. Our model integrates a high-level perception decoding pipeline and a pixel-wise reconstruction pipeline guided by high-level perceptions, simulating bottom-up and top-down processes in neuroscience. Empirical experiments demonstrate robust neural representation learning across subjects for both pipelines. Moreover, merging high-level and low-level information improves both low-level and high-level reconstruction metrics. Additionally, we successfully transfer learned general knowledge to new subjects by training new adapters with limited training data. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, notably pre-training-based methods (Mind-Vis and fMRI-PTE), our approach achieves comparable or superior results across diverse tasks, showing promise as an alternative method for cross-subject fMRI data pre-training. Our code and pre-trained weights will be publicly released at https://github.com/YulongBonjour/See_Through_Their_Minds.



### Say Anything with Any Style

- **Summary**: Generating stylized talking head with diverse head motions is crucial for achieving natural-looking videos but still remains challenging. Previous works either adopt a regressive method to capture the speaking style, resulting in a coarse style that is averaged across all training data, or employ a universal network to synthesize videos with different styles which causes suboptimal performance. To address these, we propose a novel dynamic-weight method, namely Say Anything withAny Style (SAAS), which queries the discrete style representation via a generative model with a learned style codebook. Specifically, we develop a multi-task VQ-VAE that incorporates three closely related tasks to learn a style codebook as a prior for style extraction. This discrete prior, along with the generative model, enhances the precision and robustness when extracting the speaking styles of the given style clips. By utilizing the extracted style, a residual architecture comprising a canonical branch and style-specific branch is employed to predict the mouth shapes conditioned on any driving audio while transferring the speaking style from the source to any desired one. To adapt to different speaking styles, we steer clear of employing a universal network by exploring an elaborate HyperStyle to produce the style-specific weights offset for the style branch. Furthermore, we construct a pose generator and a pose codebook to store the quantized pose representation, allowing us to sample diverse head motions aligned with the audio and the extracted style. Experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-theart methods in terms of both lip-synchronization and stylized expression. Besides, we extend our SAAS to video-driven style editing field and achieve satisfactory performance.

- **Summary**: Although automatically animating audio-driven talking heads has recently received growing interest, previous efforts have mainly concentrated on achieving lip synchronization with the audio, neglecting two crucial elements for generating expressive videos: emotion style and art style. In this paper, we present an innovative audio-driven talking face generation method called Style2Talker. It involves two stylized stages, namely Style-E and Style-A, which integrate text-controlled emotion style and picture-controlled art style into the final output. In order to prepare the scarce emotional text descriptions corresponding to the videos, we propose a labor-free paradigm that employs large-scale pretrained models to automatically annotate emotional text labels for existing audiovisual datasets. Incorporating the synthetic emotion texts, the Style-E stage utilizes a large-scale CLIP model to extract emotion representations, which are combined with the audio, serving as the condition for an efficient latent diffusion model designed to produce emotional motion coefficients of a 3DMM model. Moving on to the Style-A stage, we develop a coefficient-driven motion generator and an art-specific style path embedded in the well-known StyleGAN. This allows us to synthesize high-resolution artistically stylized talking head videos using the generated emotional motion coefficients and an art style source picture. Moreover, to better preserve image details and avoid artifacts, we provide StyleGAN with the multi-scale content features extracted from the identity image and refine its intermediate feature maps by the designed content encoder and refinement network, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of audio-lip synchronization and performance of both emotion style and art style.

- **Summary**: Generating emotional talking faces is a practical yet challenging endeavor. To create a lifelike avatar, we draw upon two critical insights from a human perspective: 1) The connection between audio and the non-deterministic facial dynamics, encompassing expressions, blinks, poses, should exhibit synchronous and one-to-many mapping. 2) Vibrant expressions are often accompanied by emotion-aware high-definition (HD) textures and finely detailed teeth. However, both aspects are frequently overlooked by existing methods. To this end, this paper proposes using normalizing Flow and Vector-Quantization modeling to produce emotional talking faces that satisfy both insights concurrently (FlowVQTalker). Specifically, we develop a flow-based coefficient generator that encodes the dynamics of facial emotion into a multi-emotion-class latent space represented as a mixture distribution. The generation process commences with random sampling from the modeled distribution, guided by the accompanying audio, enabling both lip-synchronization and the uncertain nonverbal facial cues generation. Furthermore, our designed vector-quantization image generator treats the creation of expressive facial images as a code query task, utilizing a learned codebook to provide rich, high-quality textures that enhance the emotional perception of the results. Extensive experiments are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, when extending image stitching to video stitching. It unveils the temporal instability of warped content in non-overlapping regions, despite image stitching having endeavored to preserve the natural structures. Therefore, in most cases, even if the input videos to be stitched are stable, the stitched video will inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To eliminate the shakes, we propose StabStitch to simultaneously realize video stitching and video stabilization in a unified unsupervised learning framework. Starting from the camera paths in video stabilization, we first derive the expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Then a warp smoothing model is presented to optimize them with a comprehensive consideration regarding content alignment, trajectory smoothness, spatial consistency, and online collaboration. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Compared with existing stitching solutions, StabStitch exhibits significant superiority in scene robustness and inference speed in addition to stitching and stabilization performance, contributing to a robust and real-time online video stitching system. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/nie-lang/StabStitch.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have notably improved the perceptual quality of generated images in text-to-image synthesis tasks. However, diffusion models often struggle to produce images that accurately reflect the intended semantics of the associated text prompts. We examine cross-attention layers in diffusion models and observe a propensity for these layers to disproportionately focus on certain tokens during the generation process, thereby undermining semantic fidelity. To address the issue of dominant attention, we introduce attention regulation, a computation-efficient on-the-fly optimization approach at inference time to align attention maps with the input text prompt. Notably, our method requires no additional training or fine-tuning and serves as a plug-in module on a model. Hence, the generation capacity of the original model is fully preserved. We compare our approach with alternative approaches across various datasets, evaluation metrics, and diffusion models. Experiment results show that our method consistently outperforms other baselines, yielding images that more faithfully reflect the desired concepts with reduced computation overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/YaNgZhAnG-V5/attention_regulation.

- **Summary**: As a fundamental problem in transfer learning, model selection aims to rank off-the-shelf pre-trained models and select the most suitable one for the new target task. Existing model selection techniques are often constrained in their scope and tend to overlook the nuanced relationships between models and tasks. In this paper, we present a pragmatic framework \textbf{Fennec}, delving into a diverse, large-scale model repository while meticulously considering the intricate connections between tasks and models. The key insight is to map all models and historical tasks into a transfer-related subspace, where the distance between model vectors and task vectors represents the magnitude of transferability. A large vision model, as a proxy, infers a new task's representation in the transfer space, thereby circumventing the computational burden of extensive forward passes. We also investigate the impact of the inherent inductive bias of models on transfer results and propose a novel method called \textbf{archi2vec} to encode the intricate structures of models. The transfer score is computed through straightforward vector arithmetic with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Finally, we make a substantial contribution to the field by releasing a comprehensive benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through rigorous testing on two benchmarks. The benchmark and the code will be publicly available in the near future.

- **Summary**: Novel view synthesis has observed tremendous developments since the arrival of NeRFs. However, Nerf models overfit on a single scene, lacking generalization to out of distribution objects. Recently, diffusion models have exhibited remarkable performance on introducing generalization in view synthesis. Inspired by these advancements, we explore the capabilities of a pretrained stable diffusion model for view synthesis without explicit 3D priors. Specifically, we base our method on a personalized text to image model, Dreambooth, given its strong ability to adapt to specific novel objects with a few shots. Our research reveals two interesting findings. First, we observe that Dreambooth can learn the high level concept of a view, compared to arguably more complex strategies which involve finetuning diffusions on large amounts of multi-view data. Second, we establish that the concept of a view can be disentangled and transferred to a novel object irrespective of the original object's identify from which the views are learnt. Motivated by this, we introduce a learning strategy, FSViewFusion, which inherits a specific view through only one image sample of a single scene, and transfers the knowledge to a novel object, learnt from few shots, using low rank adapters. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method, albeit simple, is efficient in generating reliable view samples for in the wild images. Code and models will be released.

- **Summary**: Large pre-trained models with their numerous model parameters and extensive training datasets have shown excellent performance in various tasks. Many publicly available medical image datasets do not have a sufficient amount of data so there are few large-scale models in medical imaging. We propose a large-scale Tumor Segmentation Foundation Model (TSFM) with 1.6 billion parameters using Resblock-backbone and Transformer-bottleneck,which has good transfer ability for downstream tasks. To make TSFM exhibit good performance in tumor segmentation, we make full use of the strong spatial correlation between tumors and organs in the medical image, innovatively fuse 7 tumor datasets and 3 multi-organ datasets to build a 3D medical dataset pool, including 2779 cases with totally 300k medical images, whose size currently exceeds many other single publicly available datasets. TSFM is the pre-trained model for medical image segmentation, which also can be transferred to multiple downstream tasks for fine-tuning learning. The average performance of our pre-trained model is 2% higher than that of nnU-Net across various tumor types. In the transfer learning task, TSFM only needs 5% training epochs of nnU-Net to achieve similar performance and can surpass nnU-Net by 2% on average with 10% training epoch. Pre-trained TSFM and its code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Diffusion-driven text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable advancements. To further improve T2I models' capability in numerical and spatial reasoning, the layout is employed as an intermedium to bridge large language models and layout-based diffusion models. However, these methods still struggle with generating images from textural prompts with multiple objects and complicated spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a divide-and-conquer approach which decouples the T2I generation task into simple subtasks. Our approach divides the layout prediction stage into numerical \& spatial reasoning and bounding box prediction. Then, the layout-to-image generation stage is conducted in an iterative manner to reconstruct objects from easy ones to difficult ones. We conduct experiments on the HRS and NSR-1K benchmarks and our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art models with notable margins. In addition, visual results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the controllability and consistency in generating multiple objects from complex textural prompts.

- **Summary**: Existing interactive point cloud segmentation approaches primarily focus on the object segmentation, which aim to determine which points belong to the object of interest guided by user interactions. This paper concentrates on an unexplored yet meaningful task, i.e., interactive point cloud semantic segmentation, which assigns high-quality semantic labels to all points in a scene with user corrective clicks. Concretely, we presents the first interactive framework for point cloud semantic segmentation, named InterPCSeg, which seamlessly integrates with off-the-shelf semantic segmentation networks without offline re-training, enabling it to run in an on-the-fly manner. To achieve online refinement, we treat user interactions as sparse training examples during the test-time. To address the instability caused by the sparse supervision, we design a stabilization energy to regulate the test-time training process. For objective and reproducible evaluation, we develop an interaction simulation scheme tailored for the interactive point cloud semantic segmentation task. We evaluate our framework on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets with off-the-shelf segmentation networks, incorporating interactions from both the proposed interaction simulator and real users. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in refining the semantic segmentation results with user interactions. The source code will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recent success of vision foundation models have shown promising performance for the 2D perception tasks. However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist model by 13.4$\%$, 11.3$\%$, and 12$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various segmentation models and even surpasses the supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Contemporary no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models can effectively quantify the perceived image quality, with high correlations between model predictions and human perceptual scores on fixed test sets. However, little progress has been made in comparing NR-IQA models from a perceptual optimization perspective. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that NR-IQA models can be plugged into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for image enhancement. This is achieved by taking the gradients in differentiable and bijective diffusion latents rather than in the raw pixel domain. Different NR-IQA models are likely to induce different enhanced images, which are ultimately subject to psychophysical testing. This leads to a new computational method for comparing NR-IQA models within the analysis-by-synthesis framework. Compared to conventional correlation-based metrics, our method provides complementary insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of the competing NR-IQA models in the context of perceptual optimization.

- **Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) excel in world knowledge understanding, adapting them to specific subfields requires precise adjustments. Due to the model's vast scale, traditional global fine-tuning methods for large models can be computationally expensive and impact generalization. To address this challenge, a range of innovative Parameters-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged and achieved remarkable success in both LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). In the medical domain, fine-tuning a medical Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) model is essential for adapting it to specific tasks. Can the fine-tuning methods for large models be transferred to the medical field to enhance transfer learning efficiency? In this paper, we delve into the fine-tuning methods of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments to investigate the impact of fine-tuning methods for large models on existing multimodal models in the medical domain from the training data level and the model structure level. We show the different impacts of fine-tuning methods for large models on medical VLMs and develop the most efficient ways to fine-tune medical VLP models. We hope this research can guide medical domain researchers in optimizing VLMs' training costs, fostering the broader application of VLMs in healthcare fields. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Sparsification-based pruning has been an important category in model compression. Existing methods commonly set sparsity-inducing penalty terms to suppress the importance of dropped weights, which is regarded as the suppressed sparsification paradigm. However, this paradigm inactivates the dropped parts of networks causing capacity damage before pruning, thereby leading to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, we first study and reveal the relative sparsity effect in emerging stimulative training and then propose a structured pruning framework, named STP, based on an enhanced sparsification paradigm which maintains the magnitude of dropped weights and enhances the expressivity of kept weights by self-distillation. Besides, to find an optimal architecture for the pruned network, we propose a multi-dimension architecture space and a knowledge distillation-guided exploration strategy. To reduce the huge capacity gap of distillation, we propose a subnet mutating expansion technique. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks indicate the effectiveness of STP. Specifically, without fine-tuning, our method consistently achieves superior performance at different budgets, especially under extremely aggressive pruning scenarios, e.g., remaining 95.11% Top-1 accuracy (72.43% in 76.15%) while reducing 85% FLOPs for ResNet-50 on ImageNet. Codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology has propelled audio-driven talking head generation, gaining considerable research attention for practical applications. However, performance evaluation research lags behind the development of talking head generation techniques. Existing literature relies on heuristic quantitative metrics without human validation, hindering accurate progress assessment. To address this gap, we collect talking head videos generated from four generative methods and conduct controlled psychophysical experiments on visual quality, lip-audio synchronization, and head movement naturalness. Our experiments validate consistency between model predictions and human annotations, identifying metrics that align better with human opinions than widely-used measures. We believe our work will facilitate performance evaluation and model development, providing insights into AIGC in a broader context.

- **Summary**: Multi-source domain adaptation aims to reduce performance degradation when applying machine learning models to unseen domains. A fundamental challenge is devising the optimal strategy for feature selection. Existing literature is somewhat paradoxical: some advocate for learning invariant features from source domains, while others favor more diverse features. To address the challenge, we propose a statistical framework that distinguishes the utilities of features based on the variance of their correlation to label $y$ across domains. Under our framework, we design and analyze a learning procedure consisting of learning approximately shared feature representation from source tasks and fine-tuning it on the target task. Our theoretical analysis necessitates the importance of learning approximately shared features instead of only the strictly invariant features and yields an improved population risk compared to previous results on both source and target tasks, thus partly resolving the paradox mentioned above. Inspired by our theory, we proposed a more practical way to isolate the content (invariant+approximately shared) from environmental features and further consolidate our theoretical findings.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based face restoration models, increasingly prevalent in smart devices, have become targets for sophisticated backdoor attacks. These attacks, through subtle trigger injection into input face images, can lead to unexpected restoration outcomes. Unlike conventional methods focused on classification tasks, our approach introduces a unique degradation objective tailored for attacking restoration models. Moreover, we propose the Adaptive Selective Frequency Injection Backdoor Attack (AS-FIBA) framework, employing a neural network for input-specific trigger generation in the frequency domain, seamlessly blending triggers with benign images. This results in imperceptible yet effective attacks, guiding restoration predictions towards subtly degraded outputs rather than conspicuous targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the degradation objective on state-of-the-art face restoration models. Additionally, it is notable that AS-FIBA can insert effective backdoors that are more imperceptible than existing backdoor attack methods, including WaNet, ISSBA, and FIBA.

- **Summary**: Developing high-performance, real-time architectures for LiDAR-based 3D object detectors is essential for the successful commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Pillar-based methods stand out as a practical choice for onboard deployment due to their computational efficiency. However, despite their efficiency, these methods can sometimes underperform compared to alternative point encoding techniques such as Voxel-encoding or PointNet++. We argue that current pillar-based methods have not sufficiently captured the fine-grained distributions of LiDAR points within each pillar structure. Consequently, there exists considerable room for improvement in pillar feature encoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel pillar encoding architecture referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE utilizes Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. Through STV grids, points within each pillar are individually encoded using Vertical PFE (V-PFE), Temporal PFE (T-PFE), and Horizontal PFE (H-PFE). These encoded features are then aggregated through an Attentive Pillar Aggregation method. Our experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that FG-PFE achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models such as PointPillar, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PillarNet, with only a minor increase in computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, or Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) are novel neuromorphic sensors that capture brightness changes as a continuous stream of ``events'' rather than traditional intensity frames. Converting sparse events to dense intensity frames faithfully has long been an ill-posed problem. Previous methods have primarily focused on converting events to video in dynamic scenes or with a moving camera. In this paper, for the first time, we realize events to dense intensity image conversion using a stationary event camera in static scenes. Different from traditional methods that mainly rely on event integration, the proposed Event-Based Temporal Mapping Photography (EvTemMap) measures the time of event emitting for each pixel. Then, the resulting Temporal Matrix is converted to an intensity frame with a temporal mapping neural network. At the hardware level, the proposed EvTemMap is implemented by combining a transmittance adjustment device with a DVS, named Adjustable Transmittance Dynamic Vision Sensor. Additionally, we collected TemMat dataset under various conditions including low-light and high dynamic range scenes. The experimental results showcase the high dynamic range, fine-grained details, and high-grayscale-resolution of the proposed EvTemMap, as well as the enhanced performance on downstream computer vision tasks compared to other methods. The code and TemMat dataset will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Estimating reliable geometric model parameters from the data with severe outliers is a fundamental and important task in computer vision. This paper attempts to sample high-quality subsets and select model instances to estimate parameters in the multi-structural data. To address this, we propose an effective method called Latent Semantic Consensus (LSC). The principle of LSC is to preserve the latent semantic consensus in both data points and model hypotheses. Specifically, LSC formulates the model fitting problem into two latent semantic spaces based on data points and model hypotheses, respectively. Then, LSC explores the distributions of points in the two latent semantic spaces, to remove outliers, generate high-quality model hypotheses, and effectively estimate model instances. Finally, LSC is able to provide consistent and reliable solutions within only a few milliseconds for general multi-structural model fitting, due to its deterministic fitting nature and efficiency. Compared with several state-of-the-art model fitting methods, our LSC achieves significant superiority for the performance of both accuracy and speed on synthetic data and real images.

- **Summary**: In the digital era, QR codes serve as a linchpin connecting virtual and physical realms. Their pervasive integration across various applications highlights the demand for aesthetically pleasing codes without compromised scannability. However, prevailing methods grapple with the intrinsic challenge of balancing customization and scannability. Notably, stable-diffusion models have ushered in an epoch of high-quality, customizable content generation. This paper introduces Text2QR, a pioneering approach leveraging these advancements to address a fundamental challenge: concurrently achieving user-defined aesthetics and scanning robustness. To ensure stable generation of aesthetic QR codes, we introduce the QR Aesthetic Blueprint (QAB) module, generating a blueprint image exerting control over the entire generation process. Subsequently, the Scannability Enhancing Latent Refinement (SELR) process refines the output iteratively in the latent space, enhancing scanning robustness. This approach harnesses the potent generation capabilities of stable-diffusion models, navigating the trade-off between image aesthetics and QR code scannability. Our experiments demonstrate the seamless fusion of visual appeal with the practical utility of aesthetic QR codes, markedly outperforming prior methods.

- **Summary**: Acquiring the desired font for various design tasks can be challenging and requires professional typographic knowledge. While previous font retrieval or generation works have alleviated some of these difficulties, they often lack support for multiple languages and semantic attributes beyond the training data domains. To solve this problem, we present FontCLIP: a model that connects the semantic understanding of a large vision-language model with typographical knowledge. We integrate typography-specific knowledge into the comprehensive vision-language knowledge of a pretrained CLIP model through a novel finetuning approach. We propose to use a compound descriptive prompt that encapsulates adaptively sampled attributes from a font attribute dataset focusing on Roman alphabet characters. FontCLIP's semantic typographic latent space demonstrates two unprecedented generalization abilities. First, FontCLIP generalizes to different languages including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), capturing the typographical features of fonts across different languages, even though it was only finetuned using fonts of Roman characters. Second, FontCLIP can recognize the semantic attributes that are not presented in the training data. FontCLIP's dual-modality and generalization abilities enable multilingual and cross-lingual font retrieval and letter shape optimization, reducing the burden of obtaining desired fonts.

- **Summary**: Graph matching is a commonly used technique in computer vision and pattern recognition. Recent data-driven approaches have improved the graph matching accuracy remarkably, whereas some traditional algorithm-based methods are more robust to feature noises, outlier nodes, and global transformation (e.g.~rotation). In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) based approach to combine the advantages of data-driven and traditional methods. In the GNN framework, we transform traditional graph-matching solvers as single-channel GNNs on the association graph and extend the single-channel architecture to the multi-channel network. The proposed model can be seen as an ensemble method that fuses multiple algorithms at every iteration. Instead of averaging the estimates at the end of the ensemble, in our approach, the independent iterations of the ensembled algorithms exchange their information after each iteration via a 1x1 channel-wise convolution layer. Experiments show that our model improves the performance of traditional algorithms significantly. In addition, we propose a random sampling strategy to reduce the computational complexity and GPU memory usage, so the model applies to matching graphs with thousands of nodes. We evaluate the performance of our method on three tasks: geometric graph matching, semantic feature matching, and few-shot 3D shape classification. The proposed model performs comparably or outperforms the best existing GNN-based methods.

- **Summary**: AI for cancer detection encounters the bottleneck of data scarcity, annotation difficulty, and low prevalence of early tumors. Tumor synthesis seeks to create artificial tumors in medical images, which can greatly diversify the data and annotations for AI training. However, current tumor synthesis approaches are not applicable across different organs due to their need for specific expertise and design. This paper establishes a set of generic rules to simulate tumor development. Each cell (pixel) is initially assigned a state between zero and ten to represent the tumor population, and a tumor can be developed based on three rules to describe the process of growth, invasion, and death. We apply these three generic rules to simulate tumor development--from pixel to cancer--using cellular automata. We then integrate the tumor state into the original computed tomography (CT) images to generate synthetic tumors across different organs. This tumor synthesis approach allows for sampling tumors at multiple stages and analyzing tumor-organ interaction. Clinically, a reader study involving three expert radiologists reveals that the synthetic tumors and their developing trajectories are convincingly realistic. Technically, we generate tumors at varied stages in 9,262 raw, unlabeled CT images sourced from 68 hospitals worldwide. The performance in segmenting tumors in the liver, pancreas, and kidneys exceeds prevailing literature benchmarks, underlining the immense potential of tumor synthesis, especially for earlier cancer detection.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a slide window manner and constructs ST voxel to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Experimental results show that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation allows model to mine effective supervision from unlabeled data to complement label-guided training. Recent research has primarily focused on consistency regularization techniques, exploring perturbation-invariant training at both the image and feature levels. In this work, we proposed a novel feature-level consistency learning framework named Density-Descending Feature Perturbation (DDFP). Inspired by the low-density separation assumption in semi-supervised learning, our key insight is that feature density can shed a light on the most promising direction for the segmentation classifier to explore, which is the regions with lower density. We propose to shift features with confident predictions towards lower-density regions by perturbation injection. The perturbed features are then supervised by the predictions on the original features, thereby compelling the classifier to explore less dense regions to effectively regularize the decision boundary. Central to our method is the estimation of feature density. To this end, we introduce a lightweight density estimator based on normalizing flow, allowing for efficient capture of the feature density distribution in an online manner. By extracting gradients from the density estimator, we can determine the direction towards less dense regions for each feature. The proposed DDFP outperforms other designs on feature-level perturbations and shows state of the art performances on both Pascal VOC and Cityscapes dataset under various partition protocols. The project is available at https://github.com/Gavinwxy/DDFP.

- **Summary**: Recently, state space model (SSM) has gained great attention due to its promising performance, linear complexity, and long sequence modeling ability in both language and image domains. However, it is non-trivial to extend SSM to the point cloud field, because of the causality requirement of SSM and the disorder and irregularity nature of point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel SSM-based point cloud processing backbone, named Point Mamba, with a causality-aware ordering mechanism. To construct the causal dependency relationship, we design an octree-based ordering strategy on raw irregular points, globally sorting points in a z-order sequence and also retaining their spatial proximity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with transformer-based counterparts, with 93.4% accuracy and 75.7 mIOU respectively on the ModelNet40 classification dataset and ScanNet semantic segmentation dataset. Furthermore, our Point Mamba has linear complexity, which is more efficient than transformer-based methods. Our method demonstrates the great potential that SSM can serve as a generic backbone in point cloud understanding. Codes are released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/Point-Mamba.

- **Summary**: 3D-consistent image generation from a single 2D semantic label is an important and challenging research topic in computer graphics and computer vision. Although some related works have made great progress in this field, most of the existing methods suffer from poor disentanglement performance of shape and appearance, and lack multi-modal control. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end 3D-aware image generation and editing model incorporating multiple types of conditional inputs, including pure noise, text and reference image. On the one hand, we dive into the latent space of 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and propose a novel disentanglement strategy to separate appearance features from shape features during the generation process. On the other hand, we propose a unified framework for flexible image generation and editing tasks with multi-modal conditions. Our method can generate diverse images with distinct noises, edit the attribute through a text description and conduct style transfer by giving a reference RGB image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternative approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively on image generation and editing.

- **Summary**: In the cutting-edge domain of medical artificial intelligence (AI), remarkable advances have been achieved in areas such as diagnosis, prediction, and therapeutic interventions. Despite these advances, the technology for image segmentation faces the significant barrier of having to produce extensively annotated datasets. To address this challenge, few-shot segmentation (FSS) has been recognized as one of the innovative solutions. Although most of the FSS research has focused on human health care, its application in veterinary medicine, particularly for pet care, remains largely limited. This study has focused on accurate segmentation of the heart and left atrial enlargement on canine chest radiographs using the proposed deep prototype alignment network (DPANet). The PANet architecture is adopted as the backbone model, and experiments are conducted using various encoders based on VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 to extract features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DPANet achieves the highest performance. In the 2way-1shot scenario, it achieves the highest intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.6966, and in the 2way-5shot scenario, it achieves the highest IoU value of 0.797. The DPANet not only signifies a performance improvement, but also shows an improved training speed in the 2way-5shot scenario. These results highlight our model's exceptional capability as a trailblazing solution for segmenting the heart and left atrial enlargement in veterinary applications through FSS, setting a new benchmark in veterinary AI research, and demonstrating its superior potential to veterinary medicine advances.

- **Summary**: Soft tissue tracking is crucial for computer-assisted interventions. Existing approaches mainly rely on extracting discriminative features from the template and videos to recover corresponding matches. However, it is difficult to adopt these techniques in surgical scenes, where tissues are changing in shape and appearance throughout the surgery. To address this problem, we exploit optical flow to naturally capture the pixel-wise tissue deformations and adaptively correct the tracked template. Specifically, we first implement an inter-frame matching mechanism to extract a coarse region of interest based on optical flow from consecutive frames. To accommodate appearance change and alleviate drift, we then propose an adaptive-template matching method, which updates the tracked template based on the reliability of the estimates. Our approach, Ada-Tracker, enjoys both short-term dynamics modeling by capturing local deformations and long-term dynamics modeling by introducing global temporal compensation. We evaluate our approach on the public SurgT benchmark, which is generated from Hamlyn, SCARED, and Kidney boundary datasets. The experimental results show that Ada-Tracker achieves superior accuracy and performs more robustly against prior works. Code is available at https://github.com/wrld/Ada-Tracker.

- **Summary**: Previous Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) approaches exclusively utilize support features for prototype generation, neglecting the specific requirements of the query. To address this, we present the Query-guided Prototype Evolution Network (QPENet), a new method that integrates query features into the generation process of foreground and background prototypes, thereby yielding customized prototypes attuned to specific queries. The evolution of the foreground prototype is accomplished through a \textit{support-query-support} iterative process involving two new modules: Pseudo-prototype Generation (PPG) and Dual Prototype Evolution (DPE). The PPG module employs support features to create an initial prototype for the preliminary segmentation of the query image, resulting in a pseudo-prototype reflecting the unique needs of the current query. Subsequently, the DPE module performs reverse segmentation on support images using this pseudo-prototype, leading to the generation of evolved prototypes, which can be considered as custom solutions. As for the background prototype, the evolution begins with a global background prototype that represents the generalized features of all training images. We also design a Global Background Cleansing (GBC) module to eliminate potential adverse components mirroring the characteristics of the current foreground class. Experimental results on the PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets attest to the substantial enhancements achieved by QPENet over prevailing state-of-the-art techniques, underscoring the validity of our ideas.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the problem of Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD), aiming to train one single detection model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse datasets from different application domains without any further training on the target data. Some recent studies have shown that large pre-trained Visual-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have strong generalization capabilities on detecting industrial defects from various datasets, but their methods rely heavily on handcrafted text prompts about defects, making them difficult to generalize to anomalies in other applications, e.g., medical image anomalies or semantic anomalies in natural images. In this work, we propose to train a GAD model with few-shot normal images as sample prompts for AD on diverse datasets on the fly. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that learns an in-context residual learning model for GAD, termed InCTRL. It is trained on an auxiliary dataset to discriminate anomalies from normal samples based on a holistic evaluation of the residuals between query images and few-shot normal sample prompts. Regardless of the datasets, per definition of anomaly, larger residuals are expected for anomalies than normal samples, thereby enabling InCTRL to generalize across different domains without further training. Comprehensive experiments on nine AD datasets are performed to establish a GAD benchmark that encapsulate the detection of industrial defect anomalies, medical anomalies, and semantic anomalies in both one-vs-all and multi-class setting, on which InCTRL is the best performer and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based models have gained widespread popularity in both the computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) fields. However, significant challenges arise during post-training linear quantization, leading to noticeable reductions in inference accuracy. Our study focuses on uncovering the underlying causes of these accuracy drops and proposing a quantization-friendly fine-tuning method, \textbf{QuantTune}. Firstly, our analysis revealed that, on average, 65\% of quantization errors result from the precision loss incurred by the dynamic range amplification effect of outliers across the target Transformer-based models. Secondly, \textbf{QuantTune} adjusts weights based on the deviation of outlier activations and effectively constrains the dynamic ranges of the problematic activations. As a result, it successfully mitigates the negative impact of outliers on the inference accuracy of quantized models. Lastly, \textbf{QuantTune} can be seamlessly integrated into the back-propagation pass in the fine-tuning process without requiring extra complexity in inference software and hardware design. Our approach showcases significant improvements in post-training quantization across a range of Transformer-based models, including ViT, Bert-base, and OPT. QuantTune reduces accuracy drops by 12.09\% at 8-bit quantization and 33.8\% at 7-bit compared to top calibration methods, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions by over 18.84\% across ViT models.

- **Summary**: Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease that seriously affects patients' quality of life. Traditional osteoporosis diagnosis methods are expensive and complex. The semi-supervised model based on diffusion model and class threshold sinusoidal decay proposed in this paper can automatically diagnose osteoporosis based on patient's imaging data, which has the advantages of convenience, accuracy, and low cost. Unlike previous semi-supervised models, all the unlabeled data used in this paper are generated by the diffusion model. Compared with real unlabeled data, synthetic data generated by the diffusion model show better performance. In addition, this paper proposes a novel pseudo-label threshold adjustment mechanism, Sinusoidal Threshold Decay, which can make the semi-supervised model converge more quickly and improve its performance. Specifically, the method is tested on a dataset including 749 dental panoramic images, and its achieved leading detect performance and produces a 80.10% accuracy.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, 3D detection provides more precise information to downstream tasks, including path planning and motion estimation, compared to 2D detection. Therefore, the need for 3D detection research has emerged. However, although single and multi-view images and depth maps obtained from the camera were used, detection accuracy was relatively low compared to other modality-based detectors due to the lack of geometric information. The proposed multi-modal 3D object detection combines semantic features obtained from images and geometric features obtained from point clouds, but there are difficulties in defining unified representation to fuse data existing in different domains and synchronization between them. In this paper, we propose SeSame : point-wise semantic feature as a new presentation to ensure sufficient semantic information of the existing LiDAR-only based 3D detection. Experiments show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art at different levels of difficulty in car and performance improvement on the KITTI object detection benchmark.

- **Summary**: The neural radiance field (NeRF) has emerged as a prominent methodology for synthesizing realistic images of novel views. While neural radiance representations based on voxels or mesh individually offer distinct advantages, excelling in either rendering quality or speed, each has limitations in the other aspect. In response, we propose a pioneering hybrid representation named Vosh, seamlessly combining both voxel and mesh components in hybrid rendering for view synthesis. Vosh is meticulously crafted by optimizing the voxel grid of NeRF, strategically with selected voxels replaced by mesh. Therefore, it excels in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in intricate regions by leveraging voxel component. The flexibility of Vosh is showcased through the ability to adjust hybrid ratios, providing users the ability to control the balance between rendering quality and speed based on flexible usage. Experimental results demonstrates that our method achieves commendable trade-off between rendering quality and speed, and notably has real-time performance on mobile devices.

- **Summary**: Fully-supervised airway segmentation has accomplished significant triumphs over the years in aiding pre-operative diagnosis and intra-operative navigation. However, full voxel-level annotation constitutes a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, often plagued by issues such as missing branches, branch annotation discontinuity, or erroneous edge delineation. label-efficient solutions for airway extraction are rarely explored yet primarily demanding in medical practice. To this end, we introduce a novel skeleton-level annotation (SkA) tailored to the airway, which simplifies the annotation workflow while enhancing annotation consistency and accuracy, preserving the complete topology. Furthermore, we propose a skeleton-supervised learning framework to achieve accurate airway segmentation. Firstly, a dual-stream buffer inference is introduced to realize initial label propagation from SkA, avoiding the collapse of direct learning from SkA. Then, we construct a geometry-aware dual-path propagation framework (GDP) to further promote complementary propagation learning, composed of hard geometry-aware propagation learning and soft geometry-aware propagation guidance. Experiments reveal that our proposed framework outperforms the competing methods with SKA, which amounts to only 1.96% airways, and achieves comparable performance with the baseline model that is fully supervised with 100% airways, demonstrating its significant potential in achieving label-efficient segmentation for other tubular structures, such as vessels.

- **Summary**: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) based on concepts are explanations that consider alternative scenarios to understand which high-level semantic features contributed to particular model predictions. In this work, we propose CEs based on the semantic graphs accompanying input data to achieve more descriptive, accurate, and human-aligned explanations. Building upon state-of-the-art (SoTA) conceptual attempts, we adopt a model-agnostic edit-based approach and introduce leveraging GNNs for efficient Graph Edit Distance (GED) computation. With a focus on the visual domain, we represent images as scene graphs and obtain their GNN embeddings to bypass solving the NP-hard graph similarity problem for all input pairs, an integral part of the CE computation process. We apply our method to benchmark and real-world datasets with varying difficulty and availability of semantic annotations. Testing on diverse classifiers, we find that our CEs outperform previous SoTA explanation models based on semantics, including both white and black-box as well as conceptual and pixel-level approaches. Their superiority is proven quantitatively and qualitatively, as validated by human subjects, highlighting the significance of leveraging semantic edges in the presence of intricate relationships. Our model-agnostic graph-based approach is widely applicable and easily extensible, producing actionable explanations across different contexts.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in text-conditioned image generation diffusion models have begun paving the way for new opportunities in modern medical domain, in particular, generating Chest X-rays (CXRs) from diagnostic reports. Nonetheless, to further drive the diffusion models to generate CXRs that faithfully reflect the complexity and diversity of real data, it has become evident that a nontrivial learning approach is needed. In light of this, we propose CXRL, a framework motivated by the potential of reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we integrate a policy gradient RL approach with well-designed multiple distinctive CXR-domain specific reward models. This approach guides the diffusion denoising trajectory, achieving precise CXR posture and pathological details. Here, considering the complex medical image environment, we present "RL with Comparative Feedback" (RLCF) for the reward mechanism, a human-like comparative evaluation that is known to be more effective and reliable in complex scenarios compared to direct evaluation. Our CXRL framework includes jointly optimizing learnable adaptive condition embeddings (ACE) and the image generator, enabling the model to produce more accurate and higher perceptual CXR quality. Our extensive evaluation of the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our RL-based tuning approach. Consequently, our CXRL generates pathologically realistic CXRs, establishing a new standard for generating CXRs with high fidelity to real-world clinical scenarios.

- **Summary**: Recently, the growing capabilities of deep generative models have underscored their potential in enhancing image classification accuracy. However, existing methods often demand the generation of a disproportionately large number of images compared to the original dataset, while having only marginal improvements in accuracy. This computationally expensive and time-consuming process hampers the practicality of such approaches. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency of image generation by focusing on the specific needs and characteristics of the model. With a central tenet of active learning, our method, named ActGen, takes a training-aware approach to image generation. It aims to create images akin to the challenging or misclassified samples encountered by the current model and incorporates these generated images into the training set to augment model performance. ActGen introduces an attentive image guidance technique, using real images as guides during the denoising process of a diffusion model. The model's attention on class prompt is leveraged to ensure the preservation of similar foreground object while diversifying the background. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance method, which employs two losses to generate more challenging samples and prevent the generated images from being too similar to previously generated ones. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance with a significantly reduced number of generated images.

- **Summary**: 2D face recognition encounters challenges in unconstrained environments due to varying illumination, occlusion, and pose. Recent studies focus on RGB-D face recognition to improve robustness by incorporating depth information. However, collecting sufficient paired RGB-D training data is expensive and time-consuming, hindering wide deployment. In this work, we first construct a diverse depth dataset generated by 3D Morphable Models for depth model pre-training. Then, we propose a domain-independent pre-training framework that utilizes readily available pre-trained RGB and depth models to separately perform face recognition without needing additional paired data for retraining. To seamlessly integrate the two distinct networks and harness the complementary benefits of RGB and depth information for improved accuracy, we propose an innovative Adaptive Confidence Weighting (ACW). This mechanism is designed to learn confidence estimates for each modality to achieve modality fusion at the score level. Our method is simple and lightweight, only requiring ACW training beyond the backbone models. Experiments on multiple public RGB-D face recognition benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance surpassing previous methods based on depth estimation and feature fusion, validating the efficacy of our approach.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing visual stimulus images is a significant task in neural decoding, and up to now, most studies consider the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as the signal source. However, the fMRI-based image reconstruction methods are difficult to widely applied because of the complexity and high cost of the acquisition equipments. Considering the advantages of low cost and easy portability of the electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition equipments, we propose a novel image reconstruction method based on EEG signals in this paper. Firstly, to satisfy the high recognizability of visual stimulus images in fast switching manner, we build a visual stimuli image dataset, and obtain the EEG dataset by a corresponding EEG signals collection experiment. Secondly, the deep visual representation model(DVRM) consisting of a primary encoder and a subordinate decoder is proposed to reconstruct visual stimuli. The encoder is designed based on the residual-in-residual dense blocks to learn the distribution characteristics between EEG signals and visual stimulus images, while the decoder is designed based on the deep neural network to reconstruct the visual stimulus image from the learned deep visual representation. The DVRM can fit the deep and multiview visual features of human natural state and make the reconstructed images more precise. Finally, we evaluate the DVRM in the quality of the generated images on our EEG dataset. The results show that the DVRM have good performance in the task of learning deep visual representation from EEG signals and generating reconstructed images that are realistic and highly resemble the original images.

- **Summary**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K.

- **Summary**: Recently, the methods based on implicit neural representations have shown excellent capabilities for arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR). Although these methods represent the features of an image by generating latent codes, these latent codes are difficult to adapt for different magnification factors of super-resolution, which seriously affects their performance. Addressing this, we design Multi-Scale Implicit Transformer (MSIT), consisting of an Multi-scale Neural Operator (MSNO) and Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA). Among them, MSNO obtains multi-scale latent codes through feature enhancement, multi-scale characteristics extraction, and multi-scale characteristics merging. MSSA further enhances the multi-scale characteristics of latent codes, resulting in better performance. Furthermore, to improve the performance of network, we propose the Re-Interaction Module (RIM) combined with the cumulative training strategy to improve the diversity of learned information for the network. We have systematically introduced multi-scale characteristics for the first time in ASSR, extensive experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of MSIT, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in arbitrary super-resolution tasks.

- **Summary**: The creation of in-silico datasets can expand the utility of existing annotations to new domains with different staining patterns in computational pathology. As such, it has the potential to significantly lower the cost associated with building large and pixel precise datasets needed to train supervised deep learning models. We propose a novel approach for the generation of in-silico immunohistochemistry (IHC) images by disentangling morphology specific IHC stains into separate image channels in immunofluorescence (IF) images. The proposed approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms baseline methods as proven by training nucleus segmentation models on the created in-silico datasets.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (USS) involves segmenting images without relying on predefined labels, aiming to alleviate the burden of extensive human labeling. Existing methods utilize features generated by self-supervised models and specific priors for clustering. However, their clustering objectives are not involved in the optimization of the features during training. Additionally, due to the lack of clear class definitions in USS, the resulting segments may not align well with the clustering objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimally Matched Hierarchy (OMH) to simultaneously address the above issues. The core of our method lies in imposing structured sparsity on the feature space, which allows the features to encode information with different levels of granularity. The structure of this sparsity stems from our hierarchy (OMH). To achieve this, we learn a soft but sparse hierarchy among parallel clusters through Optimal Transport. Our OMH yields better unsupervised segmentation performance compared to existing USS methods. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of OMH when utilizing our differentiable paradigm. We will make our code publicly available.

- **Summary**: Anomalous behavior detection is a challenging research area within computer vision. Progress in this area enables automated detection of dangerous behavior using surveillance camera feeds. A dangerous behavior that is often overlooked in other research is the throwing action in traffic flow, which is one of the unique requirements of our Smart City project to enhance public safety. This paper proposes a solution for throwing action detection in surveillance videos using deep learning. At present, datasets for throwing actions are not publicly available. To address the use-case of our Smart City project, we first generate the novel public 'Throwing Action' dataset, consisting of 271 videos of throwing actions performed by traffic participants, such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers, and 130 normal videos without throwing actions. Second, we compare the performance of different feature extractors for our anomaly detection method on the UCF-Crime and Throwing-Action datasets. The explored feature extractors are the Convolutional 3D (C3D) network, the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) network, and the Multi-Fiber Network (MFNet). Finally, the performance of the anomaly detection algorithm is improved by applying the Adam optimizer instead of Adadelta, and proposing a mean normal loss function that covers the multitude of normal situations in traffic. Both aspects yield better anomaly detection performance. Besides this, the proposed mean normal loss function lowers the false alarm rate on the combined dataset. The experimental results reach an area under the ROC curve of 86.10 for the Throwing-Action dataset, and 80.13 on the combined dataset, respectively.

- **Summary**: Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic aid and medical research in radiology. Current CBIR systems face limitations due to their specialization to certain pathologies, limiting their utility. In response, we propose using vision foundation models as powerful and versatile off-the-shelf feature extractors for content-based medical image retrieval. By benchmarking these models on a comprehensive dataset of 1.6 million 2D radiological images spanning four modalities and 161 pathologies, we identify weakly-supervised models as superior, achieving a P@1 of up to 0.594. This performance not only competes with a specialized model but does so without the need for fine-tuning. Our analysis further explores the challenges in retrieving pathological versus anatomical structures, indicating that accurate retrieval of pathological features presents greater difficulty. Despite these challenges, our research underscores the vast potential of foundation models for CBIR in radiology, proposing a shift towards versatile, general-purpose medical image retrieval systems that do not require specific tuning.

- **Summary**: Classification and localization of driving actions over time is important for advanced driver-assistance systems and naturalistic driving studies. Temporal localization is challenging because it requires robustness, reliability, and accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve the temporal localization and classification accuracy performance by adapting video action recognition and 2D human-pose estimation networks to one model. Therefore, we design a transformer-based fusion architecture to effectively combine 2D-pose features and spatio-temporal features. The model uses 2D-pose features as the positional embedding of the transformer architecture and spatio-temporal features as the main input to the encoder of the transformer. The proposed solution is generic and independent of the camera numbers and positions, giving frame-based class probabilities as output. Finally, the post-processing step combines information from different camera views to obtain final predictions and eliminate false positives. The model performs well on the A2 test set of the 2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge for naturalistic driving action recognition, achieving the overlap score of the organizer-defined distracted driver behaviour metric of 0.5079.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new approach for the detection of fake videos, based on the analysis of style latent vectors and their abnormal behavior in temporal changes in the generated videos. We discovered that the generated facial videos suffer from the temporal distinctiveness in the temporal changes of style latent vectors, which are inevitable during the generation of temporally stable videos with various facial expressions and geometric transformations. Our framework utilizes the StyleGRU module, trained by contrastive learning, to represent the dynamic properties of style latent vectors. Additionally, we introduce a style attention module that integrates StyleGRU-generated features with content-based features, enabling the detection of visual and temporal artifacts. We demonstrate our approach across various benchmark scenarios in deepfake detection, showing its superiority in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios. Through further analysis, we also validate the importance of using temporal changes of style latent vectors to improve the generality of deepfake video detection.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new image-based visual place recognition (VPR) framework by exploiting the structural cues in bird's-eye view (BEV) from a single monocular camera. The motivation arises from two key observations about VPR: 1) For the methods based on both camera and LiDAR sensors, the integration of LiDAR in robotic systems has led to increased expenses, while the alignment of data between different sensors is also a major challenge. 2) Other image-/camera-based methods, involving integrating RGB images and their derived variants (e.g., pseudo depth images, pseudo 3D point clouds), exhibit several limitations, such as the failure to effectively exploit the explicit spatial relationships between different objects. To tackle the above issues, we design a new BEV-enhanced VPR framework, nemely BEV2PR, which can generate a composite descriptor with both visual cues and spatial awareness solely based on a single camera. For the visual cues, any popular aggregation module for RGB global features can be integrated into our framework. The key points lie in: 1) We use BEV segmentation features as an explicit source of structural knowledge in constructing global features. 2) The lower layers of the pre-trained backbone from BEV map generation are shared for visual and structural streams in VPR, facilitating the learning of fine-grained local features in the visual stream. 3) The complementary visual features and structural features can jointly enhance VPR performance. Our BEV2PR framework enables consistent performance improvements over several popular camera-based VPR aggregation modules when integrating them. The experiments on our collected VPR-NuScenes dataset demonstrate an absolute gain of 2.47% on Recall@1 for the strong Conv-AP baseline to achieve the best performance in our setting, and notably, a 18.06% gain on the hard set.

- **Summary**: Direct image-to-graph transformation is a challenging task that solves object detection and relationship prediction in a single model. Due to the complexity of this task, large training datasets are rare in many domains, which makes the training of large networks challenging. This data sparsity necessitates the establishment of pre-training strategies akin to the state-of-the-art in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a set of methods enabling cross-domain and cross-dimension transfer learning for image-to-graph transformers. We propose (1) a regularized edge sampling loss for sampling the optimal number of object relationships (edges) across domains, (2) a domain adaptation framework for image-to-graph transformers that aligns features from different domains, and (3) a simple projection function that allows us to pretrain 3D transformers on 2D input data. We demonstrate our method's utility in cross-domain and cross-dimension experiments, where we pretrain our models on 2D satellite images before applying them to vastly different target domains in 2D and 3D. Our method consistently outperforms a series of baselines on challenging benchmarks, such as retinal or whole-brain vessel graph extraction.

- **Summary**: Facial Attribute Classification (FAC) holds substantial promise in widespread applications. However, FAC models trained by traditional methodologies can be unfair by exhibiting accuracy inconsistencies across varied data subpopulations. This unfairness is largely attributed to bias in data, where some spurious attributes (e.g., Male) statistically correlate with the target attribute (e.g., Smiling). Most of existing fairness-aware methods rely on the labels of spurious attributes, which may be unavailable in practice. This work proposes a novel, generation-based two-stage framework to train a fair FAC model on biased data without additional annotation. Initially, we identify the potential spurious attributes based on generative models. Notably, it enhances interpretability by explicitly showing the spurious attributes in image space. Following this, for each image, we first edit the spurious attributes with a random degree sampled from a uniform distribution, while keeping target attribute unchanged. Then we train a fair FAC model by fostering model invariance to these augmentation. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in promoting fairness in FAC without compromising accuracy.

- **Summary**: Temporal localization of driving actions plays a crucial role in advanced driver-assistance systems and naturalistic driving studies. However, this is a challenging task due to strict requirements for robustness, reliability and accurate localization. In this work, we focus on improving the overall performance by efficiently utilizing video action recognition networks and adapting these to the problem of action localization. To this end, we first develop a density-guided label smoothing technique based on label probability distributions to facilitate better learning from boundary video-segments that typically include multiple labels. Second, we design a post-processing step to efficiently fuse information from video-segments and multiple camera views into scene-level predictions, which facilitates elimination of false positives. Our methodology yields a competitive performance on the A2 test set of the naturalistic driving action recognition track of the 2022 NVIDIA AI City Challenge with an F1 score of 0.271.

- **Summary**: Humans use UAVs to monitor changes in forest environments since they are lightweight and provide a large variety of surveillance data. However, their information does not present enough details for understanding the scene which is needed to assess the degree of deforestation. Deep learning algorithms must be trained on large amounts of data to output accurate interpretations, but ground truth recordings of annotated forest imagery are not available. To solve this problem, we introduce a new large aerial dataset for forest inspection which contains both real-world and virtual recordings of natural environments, with densely annotated semantic segmentation labels and depth maps, taken in different illumination conditions, at various altitudes and recording angles. We test the performance of two multi-scale neural networks for solving the semantic segmentation task (HRNet and PointFlow network), studying the impact of the various acquisition conditions and the capabilities of transfer learning from virtual to real data. Our results showcase that the best results are obtained when the training is done on a dataset containing a large variety of scenarios, rather than separating the data into specific categories. We also develop a framework to assess the deforestation degree of an area.

- **Summary**: In the ever-evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), model performance has constituted a key metric driving innovation, leading to an exponential growth in model size and complexity. However, sustainability and energy efficiency have been critical requirements during deployment in contemporary industrial settings, necessitating the use of data-efficient approaches such as few-shot learning. In this paper, to alleviate the burden of lengthy model training and minimize energy consumption, a finetuning approach to adapt standard object detection models to downstream tasks is examined. Subsequently, a thorough case study and evaluation of the energy demands of the developed models, applied in object detection benchmark datasets from volatile industrial environments is presented. Specifically, different finetuning strategies as well as utilization of ancillary evaluation data during training are examined, and the trade-off between performance and efficiency is highlighted in this low-data regime. Finally, this paper introduces a novel way to quantify this trade-off through a customized Efficiency Factor metric.

- **Summary**: Automated feature extraction from MRI brain scans and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease are ongoing challenges. With advances in 3D imaging technology, 3D data acquisition is becoming more viable and efficient than its 2D counterpart. Rather than using feature-based vectors, in this paper, for the first time, we suggest a pipeline to extract novel covariance-based descriptors from the cortical surface using the Ricci energy optimization. The covariance descriptors are components of the nonlinear manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, thus we focus on using the Gaussian radial basis function to apply manifold-based classification to the 3D shape problem. Applying this novel signature to the analysis of abnormal cortical brain morphometry allows for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Experimental studies performed on about two hundred 3D MRI brain models, gathered from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our descriptors in achieving remarkable classification accuracy.

- **Summary**: Large vision models based in deep learning architectures have been consistently advancing the state-of-the-art in biometric recognition. However, three weaknesses are commonly reported for such kind of approaches: 1) their extreme demands in terms of learning data; 2) the difficulties in generalising between different domains; and 3) the lack of interpretability/explainability, with biometrics being of particular interest, as it is important to provide evidence able to be used for forensics/legal purposes (e.g., in courts). To the best of our knowledge, this paper describes the first recognition framework/strategy that aims at addressing the three weaknesses simultaneously. At first, it relies exclusively in synthetic samples for learning purposes. Instead of requiring a large amount and variety of samples for each subject, the idea is to exclusively enroll a 3D point cloud per identity. Then, using generative strategies, we synthesize a very large (potentially infinite) number of samples, containing all the desired covariates (poses, clothing, distances, perspectives, lighting, occlusions,...). Upon the synthesizing method used, it is possible to adapt precisely to different kind of domains, which accounts for generalization purposes. Such data are then used to learn a model that performs local registration between image pairs, establishing positive correspondences between body parts that are the key, not only to recognition (according to cardinality and distribution), but also to provide an interpretable description of the response (e.g.: "both samples are from the same person, as they have similar facial shape, hair color and legs thickness").

- **Summary**: Point clouds and meshes are widely used 3D data structures for many computer vision applications. While the meshes represent the surfaces of an object, point cloud represents sampled points from the surface which is also the output of modern sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. Due to the wide application area of point clouds and the recent advancements in deep neural networks, studies focusing on robust classification of the 3D point cloud data emerged. To evaluate the robustness of deep classifier networks, a common method is to use adversarial attacks where the gradient direction is followed to change the input slightly. The previous studies on adversarial attacks are generally evaluated on point clouds of daily objects. However, considering 3D faces, these adversarial attacks tend to affect the person's facial structure more than the desired amount and cause malformation. Specifically for facial expressions, even a small adversarial attack can have a significant effect on the face structure. In this paper, we suggest an adversarial attack called $\epsilon$-Mesh Attack, which operates on point cloud data via limiting perturbations to be on the mesh surface. We also parameterize our attack by $\epsilon$ to scale the perturbation mesh. Our surface-based attack has tighter perturbation bounds compared to $L_2$ and $L_\infty$ norm bounded attacks that operate on unit-ball. Even though our method has additional constraints, our experiments on CoMA, Bosphorus and FaceWarehouse datasets show that $\epsilon$-Mesh Attack (Perpendicular) successfully confuses trained DGCNN and PointNet models $99.72\%$ and $97.06\%$ of the time, with indistinguishable facial deformations.

- **Summary**: Adversarial robustness of the neural network is a significant concern when it is applied to security-critical domains. In this situation, adversarial distillation is a promising option which aims to distill the robustness of the teacher network to improve the robustness of a small student network. Previous works pretrain the teacher network to make it robust to the adversarial examples aimed at itself. However, the adversarial examples are dependent on the parameters of the target network. The fixed teacher network inevitably degrades its robustness against the unseen transferred adversarial examples which targets the parameters of the student network in the adversarial distillation process. We propose PeerAiD to make a peer network learn the adversarial examples of the student network instead of adversarial examples aimed at itself. PeerAiD is an adversarial distillation that trains the peer network and the student network simultaneously in order to make the peer network specialized for defending the student network. We observe that such peer networks surpass the robustness of pretrained robust teacher network against student-attacked adversarial samples. With this peer network and adversarial distillation, PeerAiD achieves significantly higher robustness of the student network with AutoAttack (AA) accuracy up to 1.66%p and improves the natural accuracy of the student network up to 4.72%p with ResNet-18 and TinyImageNet dataset.

- **Summary**: In real-world applications, dynamic scenarios require the models to possess the capability to learn new tasks continuously without forgetting the old knowledge. Experience-Replay methods store a subset of the old images for joint training. In the scenario of more strict privacy protection, storing the old images becomes infeasible, which leads to a more severe plasticity-stability dilemma and classifier bias. To meet the above challenges, we propose a new architecture, named continual expansion and absorption transformer~(CEAT). The model can learn the novel knowledge by extending the expanded-fusion layers in parallel with the frozen previous parameters. After the task ends, we losslessly absorb the extended parameters into the backbone to ensure that the number of parameters remains constant. To improve the learning ability of the model, we designed a novel prototype contrastive loss to reduce the overlap between old and new classes in the feature space. Besides, to address the classifier bias towards the new classes, we propose a novel approach to generate the pseudo-features to correct the classifier. We experiment with our methods on three standard Non-Exemplar Class-Incremental Learning~(NECIL) benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model gets a significant improvement compared with the previous works and achieves 5.38%, 5.20%, and 4.92% improvement on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset.

One intriguing application is car damage detection for insurance carriers which tends to detect all car damages by comparing both pre-trip and post-trip images, even requiring two components: (i) car damage detection; (ii) image alignment. Firstly, we implemented a Mask R-CNN model to detect car damages on custom images. Whereas for the image alignment section, we especially propose a novel self-supervised Patch-to-Patch SimCLR inspired alignment approach to find perspective transformations between custom pre/post car rental images except for traditional computer vision methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large size kernels have attracted much attention in the computer vision field, following the success of the Vision Transformers. Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance. The reason for the high-performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels, but this view has not been fully tested. We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task, focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL, a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised, provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs. Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance. Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective, in which the main factor is feature map improvement. Furthermore, we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated, which has long been discussed in WSOL. CAM is the most classic WSOL method, but because of the above-mentioned problems, it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. However, experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN, CAM, and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method, which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing.

- **Summary**: Audio-visual question answering (AVQA) requires reference to video content and auditory information, followed by correlating the question to predict the most precise answer. Although mining deeper layers of audio-visual information to interact with questions facilitates the multimodal fusion process, the redundancy of audio-visual parameters tends to reduce the generalization of the inference engine to multiple question-answer pairs in a single video. Indeed, the natural heterogeneous relationship between audiovisuals and text makes the perfect fusion challenging, to prevent high-level audio-visual semantics from weakening the network's adaptability to diverse question types, we propose a framework for performing mutual correlation distillation (MCD) to aid question inference. MCD is divided into three main steps: 1) firstly, the residual structure is utilized to enhance the audio-visual soft associations based on self-attention, then key local audio-visual features relevant to the question context are captured hierarchically by shared aggregators and coupled in the form of clues with specific question vectors. 2) Secondly, knowledge distillation is enforced to align audio-visual-text pairs in a shared latent space to narrow the cross-modal semantic gap. 3) And finally, the audio-visual dependencies are decoupled by discarding the decision-level integrations. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets containing multiple question-and-answer pairs, i.e., Music-AVQA and AVQA. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and one interesting finding behind is that removing deep audio-visual features during inference can effectively mitigate overfitting.

- **Summary**: Partial Label Learning (PLL) grapples with learning from ambiguously labelled data, and it has been successfully applied in fields such as image recognition. Nevertheless, traditional PLL methods rely on the closed-world assumption, which can be limiting in open-world scenarios and negatively impact model performance and generalization. To tackle these challenges, our study introduces a novel method called PLL-OOD, which is the first to incorporate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection into the PLL framework. PLL-OOD significantly enhances model adaptability and accuracy by merging self-supervised learning with partial label loss and pioneering the Partial-Energy (PE) score for OOD detection. This approach improves data feature representation and effectively disambiguates candidate labels, using a dynamic label confidence matrix to refine predictions. The PE score, adjusted by label confidence, precisely identifies OOD instances, optimizing model training towards in-distribution data. This innovative method markedly boosts PLL model robustness and performance in open-world settings. To validate our approach, we conducted a comprehensive comparative experiment combining the existing state-of-the-art PLL model with multiple OOD scores on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with various OOD datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed PLL-OOD framework is highly effective and effectiveness outperforms existing models, showcasing its superiority and effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Cultural heritage serves as the enduring record of human thought and history. Despite significant efforts dedicated to the preservation of cultural relics, many ancient artefacts have been ravaged irreversibly by natural deterioration and human actions. Deep learning technology has emerged as a valuable tool for restoring various kinds of cultural heritages, including ancient text restoration. Previous research has approached ancient text restoration from either visual or textual perspectives, often overlooking the potential of synergizing multimodal information. This paper proposes a novel Multimodal Multitask Restoring Model (MMRM) to restore ancient texts, particularly emphasising the ideograph. This model combines context understanding with residual visual information from damaged ancient artefacts, enabling it to predict damaged characters and generate restored images simultaneously. We tested the MMRM model through experiments conducted on both simulated datasets and authentic ancient inscriptions. The results show that the proposed method gives insightful restoration suggestions in both simulation experiments and real-world scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering application of multimodal deep learning in ancient text restoration, which will contribute to the understanding of ancient society and culture in digital humanities fields.

- **Summary**: Relative monocular depth, inferring depth up to shift and scale from a single image, is an active research topic. Recent deep learning models, trained on large and varied meta-datasets, now provide excellent performance in the domain of natural images. However, few datasets exist which provide ground truth depth for endoscopic images, making training such models from scratch unfeasible. This work investigates the transfer of these models into the surgical domain, and presents an effective and simple way to improve on standard supervision through the use of temporal consistency self-supervision. We show temporal consistency significantly improves supervised training alone when transferring to the low-data regime of endoscopy, and outperforms the prevalent self-supervision technique for this task. In addition we show our method drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art method from within the domain of endoscopy. We also release our code, model and ensembled meta-dataset, Meta-MED, establishing a strong benchmark for future work.

- **Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in capturing relationships among nodes in a graph. This study introduces a novel perspective by considering a graph as a simplicial complex, encompassing nodes, edges, triangles, and $k$-simplices, enabling the definition of graph-structured data on any $k$-simplices. Our contribution is the Hodge-Laplacian heterogeneous graph attention network (HL-HGAT), designed to learn heterogeneous signal representations across $k$-simplices. The HL-HGAT incorporates three key components: HL convolutional filters (HL-filters), simplicial projection (SP), and simplicial attention pooling (SAP) operators, applied to $k$-simplices. HL-filters leverage the unique topology of $k$-simplices encoded by the Hodge-Laplacian (HL) operator, operating within the spectral domain of the $k$-th HL operator. To address computation challenges, we introduce a polynomial approximation for HL-filters, exhibiting spatial localization properties. Additionally, we propose a pooling operator to coarsen $k$-simplices, combining features through simplicial attention mechanisms of self-attention and cross-attention via transformers and SP operators, capturing topological interconnections across multiple dimensions of simplices. The HL-HGAT is comprehensively evaluated across diverse graph applications, including NP-hard problems, graph multi-label and classification challenges, and graph regression tasks in logistics, computer vision, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy and versatility in handling a wide range of graph-based scenarios.

- **Summary**: Point clouds are extensively employed in a variety of real-world applications such as robotics, autonomous driving and augmented reality. Despite the recent success of point cloud neural networks, especially for safety-critical tasks, it is essential to also ensure the robustness of the model. A typical way to assess a model's robustness is through adversarial attacks, where test-time examples are generated based on gradients to deceive the model. While many different defense mechanisms are studied in 2D, studies on 3D point clouds have been relatively limited in the academic field. Inspired from PointDP, which denoises the network inputs by diffusion, we propose Point Cloud Layerwise Diffusion (PCLD), a layerwise diffusion based 3D point cloud defense strategy. Unlike PointDP, we propagated the diffusion denoising after each layer to incrementally enhance the results. We apply our defense method to different types of commonly used point cloud models and adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed defense method achieved results that are comparable to or surpass those of existing methodologies, establishing robustness through a novel technique.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D-aware face (T3D Face) generation and manipulation is an emerging research hot spot in machine learning, which still suffers from low efficiency and poor quality. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End Efficient and Effective network for fast and accurate T3D face generation and manipulation, termed $E^3$-FaceNet. Different from existing complex generation paradigms, $E^3$-FaceNet resorts to a direct mapping from text instructions to 3D-aware visual space. We introduce a novel Style Code Enhancer to enhance cross-modal semantic alignment, alongside an innovative Geometric Regularization objective to maintain consistency across multi-view generations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that $E^3$-FaceNet can not only achieve picture-like 3D face generation and manipulation, but also improve inference speed by orders of magnitudes. For instance, compared with Latent3D, $E^3$-FaceNet speeds up the five-view generations by almost 470 times, while still exceeding in generation quality. Our code are released at https://github.com/Aria-Zhangjl/E3-FaceNet.

- **Summary**: Long-tailed distributions frequently emerge in real-world data, where a large number of minority categories contain a limited number of samples. Such imbalance issue considerably impairs the performance of standard supervised learning algorithms, which are mainly designed for balanced training sets. Recent investigations have revealed that supervised contrastive learning exhibits promising potential in alleviating the data imbalance. However, the performance of supervised contrastive learning is plagued by an inherent challenge: it necessitates sufficiently large batches of training data to construct contrastive pairs that cover all categories, yet this requirement is difficult to meet in the context of class-imbalanced data. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel probabilistic contrastive (ProCo) learning algorithm that estimates the data distribution of the samples from each class in the feature space, and samples contrastive pairs accordingly. In fact, estimating the distributions of all classes using features in a small batch, particularly for imbalanced data, is not feasible. Our key idea is to introduce a reasonable and simple assumption that the normalized features in contrastive learning follow a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on unit space, which brings two-fold benefits. First, the distribution parameters can be estimated using only the first sample moment, which can be efficiently computed in an online manner across different batches. Second, based on the estimated distribution, the vMF distribution allows us to sample an infinite number of contrastive pairs and derive a closed form of the expected contrastive loss for efficient optimization.

- **Summary**: Radiology report generation (RRG) has attracted significant attention due to its potential to reduce the workload of radiologists. Current RRG approaches are still unsatisfactory against clinical standards. This paper introduces a novel RRG method, \textbf{LM-RRG}, that integrates large models (LMs) with clinical quality reinforcement learning to generate accurate and comprehensive chest X-ray radiology reports. Our method first designs a large language model driven feature extractor to analyze and interpret different regions of the chest X-ray image, emphasizing specific regions with medical significance. Next, based on the large model's decoder, we develop a multimodal report generator that leverages multimodal prompts from visual features and textual instruction to produce the radiology report in an auto-regressive way. Finally, to better reflect the clinical significant and insignificant errors that radiologists would normally assign in the report, we introduce a novel clinical quality reinforcement learning strategy. It utilizes the radiology report clinical quality (RadCliQ) metric as a reward function in the learning process. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state of the art.

- **Summary**: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) responders often operate under time-sensitive conditions, facing cognitive overload and inherent risks, requiring essential skills in critical thinking and rapid decision-making. This paper presents CognitiveEMS, an end-to-end wearable cognitive assistant system that can act as a collaborative virtual partner engaging in the real-time acquisition and analysis of multimodal data from an emergency scene and interacting with EMS responders through Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses. CognitiveEMS processes the continuous streams of data in real-time and leverages edge computing to provide assistance in EMS protocol selection and intervention recognition. We address key technical challenges in real-time cognitive assistance by introducing three novel components: (i) a Speech Recognition model that is fine-tuned for real-world medical emergency conversations using simulated EMS audio recordings, augmented with synthetic data generated by large language models (LLMs); (ii) an EMS Protocol Prediction model that combines state-of-the-art (SOTA) tiny language models with EMS domain knowledge using graph-based attention mechanisms; (iii) an EMS Action Recognition module which leverages multimodal audio and video data and protocol predictions to infer the intervention/treatment actions taken by the responders at the incident scene. Our results show that for speech recognition we achieve superior performance compared to SOTA (WER of 0.290 vs. 0.618) on conversational data. Our protocol prediction component also significantly outperforms SOTA (top-3 accuracy of 0.800 vs. 0.200) and the action recognition achieves an accuracy of 0.727, while maintaining an end-to-end latency of 3.78s for protocol prediction on the edge and 0.31s on the server.

- **Summary**: Research on generative models to produce human-aligned / human-preferred outputs has seen significant recent contributions. Between text and image-generative models, we narrowed our focus to text-based generative models, particularly to produce captions for images that align with human preferences. In this research, we explored a potential method to amplify the performance of the Deep Neural Network Model to generate captions that are preferred by humans. This was achieved by integrating Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) using the Flickr8k dataset. Also, a novel loss function that is capable of optimizing the model based on human feedback is introduced. In this paper, we provide a concise sketch of our approach and results, hoping to contribute to the ongoing advances in the field of human-aligned generative AI models.

- **Summary**: Automatic 3D generation has recently attracted widespread attention. Recent methods have greatly accelerated the generation speed, but usually produce less-detailed objects due to limited model capacity or 3D data. Motivated by recent advancements in video diffusion models, we introduce V3D, which leverages the world simulation capacity of pre-trained video diffusion models to facilitate 3D generation. To fully unleash the potential of video diffusion to perceive the 3D world, we further introduce geometrical consistency prior and extend the video diffusion model to a multi-view consistent 3D generator. Benefiting from this, the state-of-the-art video diffusion model could be fine-tuned to generate 360degree orbit frames surrounding an object given a single image. With our tailored reconstruction pipelines, we can generate high-quality meshes or 3D Gaussians within 3 minutes. Furthermore, our method can be extended to scene-level novel view synthesis, achieving precise control over the camera path with sparse input views. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach, especially in terms of generation quality and multi-view consistency.

- **Summary**: The scale and quality of a dataset significantly impact the performance of deep models. However, acquiring large-scale annotated datasets is both a costly and time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, dataset expansion technologies aim to automatically augment datasets, unlocking the full potential of deep models. Current data expansion methods encompass image transformation-based and synthesis-based methods. The transformation-based methods introduce only local variations, resulting in poor diversity. While image synthesis-based methods can create entirely new content, significantly enhancing informativeness. However, existing synthesis methods carry the risk of distribution deviations, potentially degrading model performance with out-of-distribution samples. In this paper, we propose DistDiff, an effective data expansion framework based on the distribution-aware diffusion model. DistDiff constructs hierarchical prototypes to approximate the real data distribution, optimizing latent data points within diffusion models with hierarchical energy guidance. We demonstrate its ability to generate distribution-consistent samples, achieving substantial improvements in data expansion tasks. Specifically, without additional training, DistDiff achieves a 30.7% improvement in accuracy across six image datasets compared to the model trained on original datasets and a 9.8% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion-based method.

- **Summary**: Shortcut learning is a phenomenon where machine learning models prioritize learning simple, potentially misleading cues from data that do not generalize well beyond the training set. While existing research primarily investigates this in the realm of image classification, this study extends the exploration of shortcut learning into medical image segmentation. We demonstrate that clinical annotations such as calipers, and the combination of zero-padded convolutions and center-cropped training sets in the dataset can inadvertently serve as shortcuts, impacting segmentation accuracy. We identify and evaluate the shortcut learning on two different but common medical image segmentation tasks. In addition, we suggest strategies to mitigate the influence of shortcut learning and improve the generalizability of the segmentation models. By uncovering the presence and implications of shortcuts in medical image segmentation, we provide insights and methodologies for evaluating and overcoming this pervasive challenge and call for attention in the community for shortcuts in segmentation.

- **Summary**: Astronaut photography, spanning six decades of human spaceflight, presents a unique Earth observations dataset with immense value for both scientific research and disaster response. Despite its significance, accurately localizing the geographical extent of these images, crucial for effective utilization, poses substantial challenges. Current manual localization efforts are time-consuming, motivating the need for automated solutions. We propose a novel approach - leveraging image retrieval - to address this challenge efficiently. We introduce innovative training techniques, including Year-Wise Data Augmentation and a Neutral-Aware Multi-Similarity Loss, which contribute to the development of a high-performance model, EarthLoc. We develop six evaluation datasets and perform a comprehensive benchmark comparing EarthLoc to existing methods, showcasing its superior efficiency and accuracy. Our approach marks a significant advancement in automating the localization of astronaut photography, which will help bridge a critical gap in Earth observations data.

Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

- **Summary**: In this study, we identify the inefficient attention phenomena in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), notably within prominent models like LLaVA-1.5, QwenVL-Chat and Video-LLaVA. We find out that the attention computation over visual tokens is of extreme inefficiency in the deep layers of popular LVLMs, suggesting a need for a sparser approach compared to textual data handling. To this end, we introduce FastV, a versatile plug-and-play method designed to optimize computational efficiency by learning adaptive attention patterns in early layers and pruning visual tokens in subsequent ones. Our evaluations demonstrate FastV's ability to dramatically reduce computational costs (e.g., a 45 reduction in FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-13B) without sacrificing performance in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks. The computational efficiency and performance trade-off of FastV are highly customizable and pareto-efficient. It can compress the FLOPs of a 13B-parameter model to achieve a lower budget than that of a 7B-parameter model, while still maintaining superior performance. We believe FastV has practical values for deployment of LVLMs in edge devices and commercial models. Code is released at https://github.com/pkunlp-icler/FastV.

- **Summary**: Subject-driven generation has garnered significant interest recently due to its ability to personalize text-to-image generation. Typical works focus on learning the new subject's private attributes. However, an important fact has not been taken seriously that a subject is not an isolated new concept but should be a specialization of a certain category in the pre-trained model. This results in the subject failing to comprehensively inherit the attributes in its category, causing poor attribute-related generations. In this paper, motivated by object-oriented programming, we model the subject as a derived class whose base class is its semantic category. This modeling enables the subject to inherit public attributes from its category while learning its private attributes from the user-provided example. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play method, Subject-Derived regularization (SuDe). It constructs the base-derived class modeling by constraining the subject-driven generated images to semantically belong to the subject's category. Extensive experiments under three baselines and two backbones on various subjects show that our SuDe enables imaginative attribute-related generations while maintaining subject fidelity. Codes will be open sourced soon at FaceChain (https://github.com/modelscope/facechain).

- **Summary**: Data augmentations are useful in closing the sim-to-real domain gap when training on synthetic data. This is because they widen the training data distribution, thus encouraging the model to generalize better to other domains. Many image augmentation techniques exist, parametrized by different settings, such as strength and probability. This leads to a large space of different possible augmentation policies. Some policies work better than others for overcoming the sim-to-real gap for specific datasets, and it is unclear why. This paper presents two different interpretable metrics that can be combined to predict how well a certain augmentation policy will work for a specific sim-to-real setting, focusing on object detection. We validate our metrics by training many models with different augmentation policies and showing a strong correlation with performance on real data. Additionally, we introduce GeneticAugment, a genetic programming method that can leverage these metrics to automatically design an augmentation policy for a specific dataset without needing to train a model.

- **Summary**: Pre-trained models with large-scale training data, such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various high-level computer vision tasks such as image understanding and generation from language descriptions. Yet, their potential for low-level tasks such as image restoration remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we explore such models to enhance image restoration. As off-the-shelf features (OSF) from pre-trained models do not directly serve image restoration, we propose to learn an additional lightweight module called Pre-Train-Guided Refinement Module (PTG-RM) to refine restoration results of a target restoration network with OSF. PTG-RM consists of two components, Pre-Train-Guided Spatial-Varying Enhancement (PTG-SVE), and Pre-Train-Guided Channel-Spatial Attention (PTG-CSA). PTG-SVE enables optimal short- and long-range neural operations, while PTG-CSA enhances spatial-channel attention for restoration-related learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PTG-RM, with its compact size ($<$1M parameters), effectively enhances restoration performance of various models across different tasks, including low-light enhancement, deraining, deblurring, and denoising.

- **Summary**: Data generated by edge devices has the potential to train intelligent autonomous systems across various domains. Despite the emergence of diverse machine learning approaches addressing privacy concerns and utilizing distributed data, security issues persist due to the sensitive storage of data shards in disparate locations. This paper introduces a potentially groundbreaking paradigm for machine learning model training, specifically designed for scenarios with only a single magnetic image and its corresponding label image available. We harness the capabilities of Deep Learning to generate concise yet informative samples, aiming to overcome data scarcity. Through the utilization of deep learning's internal representations, our objective is to efficiently address data scarcity issues and produce meaningful results. This methodology presents a promising avenue for training machine learning models with minimal data.

- **Summary**: Remarkable successes were made in Medical Image Classification (MIC) recently, mainly due to wide applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, adversarial examples (AEs) exhibited imperceptible similarity with raw data, raising serious concerns on network robustness. Although adversarial training (AT), in responding to malevolent AEs, was recognized as an effective approach to improve robustness, it was challenging to overcome generalization decline of networks caused by the AT. In this paper, in order to reserve high generalization while improving robustness, we proposed a dynamic perturbation-adaptive adversarial training (DPAAT) method, which placed AT in a dynamic learning environment to generate adaptive data-level perturbations and provided a dynamically updated criterion by loss information collections to handle the disadvantage of fixed perturbation sizes in conventional AT methods and the dependence on external transference. Comprehensive testing on dermatology HAM10000 dataset showed that the DPAAT not only achieved better robustness improvement and generalization preservation but also significantly enhanced mean average precision and interpretability on various CNNs, indicating its great potential as a generic adversarial training method on the MIC.

- **Summary**: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm to extract discriminative feature representations within Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology. Despite driving notable progress, existing MIL approaches suffer from limitations in facilitating comprehensive and efficient interactions among instances, as well as challenges related to time-consuming computations and overfitting. In this paper, we incorporate the Selective Scan Space State Sequential Model (Mamba) in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for long sequence modeling with linear complexity, termed as MambaMIL. By inheriting the capability of vanilla Mamba, MambaMIL demonstrates the ability to comprehensively understand and perceive long sequences of instances. Furthermore, we propose the Sequence Reordering Mamba (SR-Mamba) aware of the order and distribution of instances, which exploits the inherent valuable information embedded within the long sequences. With the SR-Mamba as the core component, MambaMIL can effectively capture more discriminative features and mitigate the challenges associated with overfitting and high computational overhead. Extensive experiments on two public challenging tasks across nine diverse datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably against state-of-the-art MIL methods.

- **Summary**: Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis, with radiology reports serving as vital documentation. Automating report generation has emerged as a critical need to alleviate the workload of radiologists. While machine learning has facilitated report generation for 2D medical imaging, extending this to 3D has been unexplored due to computational complexity and data scarcity. We introduce the first method to generate radiology reports for 3D medical imaging, specifically targeting chest CT volumes. Given the absence of comparable methods, we establish a baseline using an advanced 3D vision encoder in medical imaging to demonstrate our method's effectiveness, which leverages a novel auto-regressive causal transformer. Furthermore, recognizing the benefits of leveraging information from previous visits, we augment CT2Rep with a cross-attention-based multi-modal fusion module and hierarchical memory, enabling the incorporation of longitudinal multimodal data.

- **Summary**: Recently, the proliferation of increasingly realistic synthetic images generated by various generative adversarial networks has increased the risk of misuse. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop a generalizable detector for accurately recognizing fake images. The conventional methods rely on generating diverse training sources or large pretrained models. In this work, we show that, on the contrary, the small and training-free filter is sufficient to capture more general artifact representations. Due to its unbias towards both the training and test sources, we define it as Data-Independent Operator (DIO) to achieve appealing improvements on unseen sources. In our framework, handcrafted filters and the randomly-initialized convolutional layer can be used as the training-free artifact representations extractor with excellent results. With the data-independent operator of a popular classifier, such as Resnet50, one could already reach a new state-of-the-art without bells and whistles. We evaluate the effectiveness of the DIO on 33 generation models, even DALLE and Midjourney. Our detector achieves a remarkable improvement of $13.3\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. The DIO and its extension can serve as strong baselines for future methods.

- **Summary**: We present Shape Non-rigid Kinematics (SNK), a novel zero-shot method for non-rigid shape matching that eliminates the need for extensive training or ground truth data. SNK operates on a single pair of shapes, and employs a reconstruction-based strategy using an encoder-decoder architecture, which deforms the source shape to closely match the target shape. During the process, an unsupervised functional map is predicted and converted into a point-to-point map, serving as a supervisory mechanism for the reconstruction. To aid in training, we have designed a new decoder architecture that generates smooth, realistic deformations. SNK demonstrates competitive results on traditional benchmarks, simplifying the shape-matching process without compromising accuracy. Our code can be found online: https://github.com/pvnieo/SNK

- **Summary**: Diffusion models are relatively easy to train but require many steps to generate samples. Consistency models are far more difficult to train, but generate samples in a single step.   In this paper we propose Multistep Consistency Models: A unification between Consistency Models (Song et al., 2023) and TRACT (Berthelot et al., 2023) that can interpolate between a consistency model and a diffusion model: a trade-off between sampling speed and sampling quality. Specifically, a 1-step consistency model is a conventional consistency model whereas we show that a $\infty$-step consistency model is a diffusion model.   Multistep Consistency Models work really well in practice. By increasing the sample budget from a single step to 2-8 steps, we can train models more easily that generate higher quality samples, while retaining much of the sampling speed benefits. Notable results are 1.4 FID on Imagenet 64 in 8 step and 2.1 FID on Imagenet128 in 8 steps with consistency distillation. We also show that our method scales to a text-to-image diffusion model, generating samples that are very close to the quality of the original model.

- **Summary**: Human action recognition in videos is a critical task with significant implications for numerous applications, including surveillance, sports analytics, and healthcare. The challenge lies in creating models that are both precise in their recognition capabilities and efficient enough for practical use. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of various deep learning models to address this challenge. Utilizing a subset of the UCF101 Videos dataset, we focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Two-Stream ConvNets. The research reveals that while CNNs effectively capture spatial features and RNNs encode temporal sequences, Two-Stream ConvNets exhibit superior performance by integrating spatial and temporal dimensions. These insights are distilled from the evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of this study underscore the potential of composite models in achieving robust human action recognition and suggest avenues for future research in optimizing these models for real-world deployment.

- **Summary**: Contrastive instance discrimination outperforms supervised learning in downstream tasks like image classification and object detection. However, this approach heavily relies on data augmentation during representation learning, which may result in inferior results if not properly implemented. Random cropping followed by resizing is a common form of data augmentation used in contrastive learning, but it can lead to degraded representation learning if the two random crops contain distinct semantic content. To address this issue, this paper introduces LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations), a framework that employs a new instance discrimination approach and an adapted loss function that ensures the shared region between positive pairs is semantically correct. The experimental results show that our approach consistently improves representation learning across different datasets compared to baseline models. For example, our approach outperforms MoCo-v2 by 5.1% on ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and several other methods on transfer learning tasks.

- **Summary**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging aims to generate an artifact-free HDR image with realistic details by fusing multi-exposure Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images. Caused by large motion and severe under-/over-exposure among input LDR images, HDR imaging suffers from ghosting artifacts and fusion distortions. To address these critical issues, we propose an HDR Transformer Deformation Convolution (HDRTransDC) network to generate high-quality HDR images, which consists of the Transformer Deformable Convolution Alignment Module (TDCAM) and the Dynamic Weight Fusion Block (DWFB). To solve the ghosting artifacts, the proposed TDCAM extracts long-distance content similar to the reference feature in the entire non-reference features, which can accurately remove misalignment and fill the content occluded by moving objects. For the purpose of eliminating fusion distortions, we propose DWFB to spatially adaptively select useful information across frames to effectively fuse multi-exposed features. Extensive experiments show that our method quantitatively and qualitatively achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Data scarcity and privacy concerns limit the availability of high-quality medical images for public use, which can be mitigated through medical image synthesis. However, current medical image synthesis methods often struggle to accurately capture the complexity of detailed anatomical structures and pathological conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel medical image synthesis model that leverages fine-grained image-text alignment and anatomy-pathology prompts to generate highly detailed and accurate synthetic medical images. Our method integrates advanced natural language processing techniques with image generative modeling, enabling precise alignment between descriptive text prompts and the synthesized images' anatomical and pathological details. The proposed approach consists of two key components: an anatomy-pathology prompting module and a fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module. The anatomy-pathology prompting module automatically generates descriptive prompts for high-quality medical images. To further synthesize high-quality medical images from the generated prompts, the fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module pre-defines a visual codebook for the radiology dataset and performs fine-grained alignment between the codebook and generated prompts to obtain key patches as visual clues, facilitating accurate image synthesis. We validate the superiority of our method through experiments on public chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate that our synthetic images preserve accurate semantic information, making them valuable for various medical applications.

- **Summary**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases, yet accurately assessing mild cortical atrophy remains a challenge due to its subtlety. Automated cortex reconstruction, paired with healthy reference ranges, aids in pinpointing pathological atrophy, yet their generalization is limited by biases from image acquisition and processing. We introduce the concept of stochastic cortical self-reconstruction (SCSR) that creates a subject-specific healthy reference by taking MRI-derived thicknesses as input and, therefore, implicitly accounting for potential confounders. SCSR randomly corrupts parts of the cortex and self-reconstructs them from the remaining information. Trained exclusively on healthy individuals, repeated self-reconstruction generates a stochastic reference cortex for assessing deviations from the norm. We present three implementations of this concept: XGBoost applied on parcels, and two autoencoders on vertex level -- one based on a multilayer perceptron and the other using a spherical U-Net. These models were trained on healthy subjects from the UK Biobank and subsequently evaluated across four public Alzheimer's datasets. Finally, we deploy the model on clinical in-house data, where deviation maps' high spatial resolution aids in discriminating between four types of dementia.

- **Summary**: World models have demonstrated superiority in autonomous driving, particularly in the generation of multi-view driving videos. However, significant challenges still exist in generating customized driving videos. In this paper, we propose DriveDreamer-2, which builds upon the framework of DriveDreamer and incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate user-defined driving videos. Specifically, an LLM interface is initially incorporated to convert a user's query into agent trajectories. Subsequently, a HDMap, adhering to traffic regulations, is generated based on the trajectories. Ultimately, we propose the Unified Multi-View Model to enhance temporal and spatial coherence in the generated driving videos. DriveDreamer-2 is the first world model to generate customized driving videos, it can generate uncommon driving videos (e.g., vehicles abruptly cut in) in a user-friendly manner. Besides, experimental results demonstrate that the generated videos enhance the training of driving perception methods (e.g., 3D detection and tracking). Furthermore, video generation quality of DriveDreamer-2 surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, showcasing FID and FVD scores of 11.2 and 55.7, representing relative improvements of 30% and 50%.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing works in embodied dialog research focus on navigation and leave the localization task understudied. The few existing dialog-based localization approaches assume the availability of entire dialog prior to localizaiton, which is impractical for deployed dialog-based localization. In this paper, we propose DiaLoc, a new dialog-based localization framework which aligns with a real human operator behavior. Specifically, we produce an iterative refinement of location predictions which can visualize current pose believes after each dialog turn. DiaLoc effectively utilizes the multimodal data for multi-shot localization, where a fusion encoder fuses vision and dialog information iteratively. We achieve state-of-the-art results on embodied dialog-based localization task, in single-shot (+7.08% in Acc5@valUnseen) and multi-shot settings (+10.85% in Acc5@valUnseen). DiaLoc narrows the gap between simulation and real-world applications, opening doors for future research on collaborative localization and navigation.

- **Summary**: Desert locust swarms present a major threat to agriculture and food security. Addressing this challenge, our study develops an operationally-ready model for predicting locust breeding grounds, which has the potential to enhance early warning systems and targeted control measures. We curated a dataset from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (UN-FAO) locust observation records and analyzed it using two types of spatio-temporal input features: remotely-sensed environmental and climate data as well as multi-spectral earth observation images. Our approach employed custom deep learning models (three-dimensional and LSTM-based recurrent convolutional networks), along with the geospatial foundational model Prithvi recently released by Jakubik et al., 2023. These models notably outperformed existing baselines, with the Prithvi-based model, fine-tuned on multi-spectral images from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, achieving the highest accuracy, F1 and ROC-AUC scores (83.03%, 81.53% and 87.69%, respectively). A significant finding from our research is that multi-spectral earth observation images alone are sufficient for effective locust breeding ground prediction without the need to explicitly incorporate climatic or environmental features.

- **Summary**: We present SimXR, a method for controlling a simulated avatar from information (headset pose and cameras) obtained from AR / VR headsets. Due to the challenging viewpoint of head-mounted cameras, the human body is often clipped out of view, making traditional image-based egocentric pose estimation challenging. On the other hand, headset poses provide valuable information about overall body motion, but lack fine-grained details about the hands and feet. To synergize headset poses with cameras, we control a humanoid to track headset movement while analyzing input images to decide body movement. When body parts are seen, the movements of hands and feet will be guided by the images; when unseen, the laws of physics guide the controller to generate plausible motion. We design an end-to-end method that does not rely on any intermediate representations and learns to directly map from images and headset poses to humanoid control signals. To train our method, we also propose a large-scale synthetic dataset created using camera configurations compatible with a commercially available VR headset (Quest 2) and show promising results on real-world captures. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we also test it on an AR headset with a forward-facing camera.

- **Summary**: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.

- **Summary**: High-performing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, both anomaly and novel class, is an important prerequisite for the practical use of classification models. In this paper, we focus on the species recognition task in images concerned with large databases, a large number of fine-grained hierarchical classes, severe class imbalance, and varying image quality. We propose a framework for combining individual OOD measures into one combined OOD (COOD) measure using a supervised model. The individual measures are several existing state-of-the-art measures and several novel OOD measures developed with novel class detection and hierarchical class structure in mind. COOD was extensively evaluated on three large-scale (500k+ images) biodiversity datasets in the context of anomaly and novel class detection. We show that COOD outperforms individual, including state-of-the-art, OOD measures by a large margin in terms of TPR@1% FPR in the majority of experiments, e.g., improving detecting ImageNet images (OOD) from 54.3% to 85.4% for the iNaturalist 2018 dataset. SHAP (feature contribution) analysis shows that different individual OOD measures are essential for various tasks, indicating that multiple OOD measures and combinations are needed to generalize. Additionally, we show that explicitly considering ID images that are incorrectly classified for the original (species) recognition task is important for constructing high-performing OOD detection methods and for practical applicability. The framework can easily be extended or adapted to other tasks and media modalities.

- **Summary**: We present a neural-field-based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photo-realistic textures. This system adapts the state-of-the-art neural radiance field (NeRF) representation to also incorporate lidar data which adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals. We exploit the trajectory from a real-time lidar SLAM system to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) procedure to both significantly reduce the computation time and to provide metric scale which is crucial for lidar depth loss. We use submapping to scale the system to large-scale environments captured over long trajectories. We demonstrate the reconstruction system with data from a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite onboard a legged robot, hand-held while scanning building scenes for 600 metres, and onboard an aerial robot surveying a multi-storey mock disaster site-building.

- **Summary**: Traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing traffic congestion that leads to smoother traffic flow, reduced idling time, and mitigated CO2 emissions. In this study, we explore the computer vision approach for TSC that modulates on-road traffic flows through visual observation. Unlike traditional feature-based approaches, vision-based methods depend much less on heuristics and predefined features, bringing promising potentials for end-to-end learning and optimization of traffic signals. Thus, we introduce a holistic traffic simulation framework called TrafficDojo towards vision-based TSC and its benchmarking by integrating the microscopic traffic flow provided in SUMO into the driving simulator MetaDrive. This proposed framework offers a versatile traffic environment for in-depth analysis and comprehensive evaluation of traffic signal controllers across diverse traffic conditions and scenarios. We establish and compare baseline algorithms including both traditional and Reinforecment Learning (RL) approaches. This work sheds insights into the design and development of vision-based TSC approaches and open up new research opportunities. All the code and baselines will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: End-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have shown exceptional performance in both closed-set and open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) tasks through the integration of language modalities. However, their demanding computational requirements have hindered their practical application in real-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied. Notably, in zero-shot scenarios on COCO and LVIS datasets, OmDet-Turbo achieves performance levels nearly on par with current state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

- **Summary**: Our research focuses on the analysis and improvement of the Graph-based Relation Inference Transformer (GRIT), which serves as an important benchmark in the field. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study using the PISC-fine dataset, to find and explore improvement in efficiency and performance of GRITv2. Our research has provided a new state-of-the-art relation recognition model on the PISC relation dataset. We introduce several features in the GRIT model and analyse our new benchmarks in two versions: GRITv2-L (large) and GRITv2-S (small). Our proposed GRITv2-L surpasses existing methods on relation recognition and the GRITv2-S is within 2% performance gap of GRITv2-L, which has only 0.0625x the model size and parameters of GRITv2-L. Furthermore, we also address the need for model compression, an area crucial for deploying efficient models on resource-constrained platforms. By applying quantization techniques, we efficiently reduced the GRITv2-S size to 22MB and deployed it on the flagship OnePlus 12 mobile which still surpasses the PISC-fine benchmarks in performance, highlighting the practical viability and improved efficiency of our model on mobile devices.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in remote heart rate measurement, motivated by data-driven approaches, have notably enhanced accuracy. However, these improvements primarily focus on recovering the rPPG signal, overlooking the implicit challenges of estimating the heart rate (HR) from the derived signal. While many methods employ the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for HR estimation, the performance of the FFT is inherently affected by a limited frequency resolution. In contrast, the Chirp-Z Transform (CZT), a generalization form of FFT, can refine the spectrum to the narrow-band range of interest for heart rate, providing improved frequential resolution and, consequently, more accurate estimation. This paper presents the advantages of employing the CZT for remote HR estimation and introduces a novel data-driven adaptive CZT estimator. The objective of our proposed model is to tailor the CZT to match the characteristics of each specific dataset sensor, facilitating a more optimal and accurate estimation of HR from the rPPG signal without compromising generalization across diverse datasets. This is achieved through a Sparse Matrix Optimization (SMO). We validate the effectiveness of our model through exhaustive evaluations on three publicly available datasets UCLA-rPPG, PURE, and UBFC-rPPG employing both intra- and cross-database performance metrics. The results reveal outstanding heart rate estimation capabilities, establishing the proposed approach as a robust and versatile estimator for any rPPG method.

- **Summary**: We propose FocusCLIP, integrating subject-level guidance--a specialized mechanism for target-specific supervision--into the CLIP framework for improved zero-shot transfer on human-centric tasks. Our novel contributions enhance CLIP on both the vision and text sides. On the vision side, we incorporate ROI heatmaps emulating human visual attention mechanisms to emphasize subject-relevant image regions. On the text side, we introduce human pose descriptions to provide rich contextual information. For human-centric tasks, FocusCLIP is trained with images from the MPII Human Pose dataset. The proposed approach surpassed CLIP by an average of 8.61% across five previously unseen datasets covering three human-centric tasks. FocusCLIP achieved an average accuracy of 33.65% compared to 25.04% by CLIP. We observed a 3.98% improvement in activity recognition, a 14.78% improvement in age classification, and a 7.06% improvement in emotion recognition. Moreover, using our proposed single-shot LLM prompting strategy, we release a high-quality MPII Pose Descriptions dataset to encourage further research in multimodal learning for human-centric tasks. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our subject-level supervision on non-human-centric tasks. FocusCLIP shows a 2.47% improvement over CLIP in zero-shot bird classification using the CUB dataset. Our findings emphasize the potential of integrating subject-level guidance with general pretraining methods for enhanced downstream performance.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian splatting has achieved very impressive performance in real-time novel view synthesis. However, it often suffers from over-reconstruction during Gaussian densification where high-variance image regions are covered by a few large Gaussians only, leading to blur and artifacts in the rendered images. We design a progressive frequency regularization (FreGS) technique to tackle the over-reconstruction issue within the frequency space. Specifically, FreGS performs coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification by exploiting low-to-high frequency components that can be easily extracted with low-pass and high-pass filters in the Fourier space. By minimizing the discrepancy between the frequency spectrum of the rendered image and the corresponding ground truth, it achieves high-quality Gaussian densification and alleviates the over-reconstruction of Gaussian splatting effectively. Experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., Mip-NeRF360, Tanks-and-Temples and Deep Blending) show that FreGS achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently.

- **Summary**: Radiance fields have demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views from sparse input views, yet prevailing methods suffer from high training costs and slow inference speed. This paper introduces DNGaussian, a depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields, offering real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting, despite it will encounter a geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance fields, we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint. Consequently, we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed geometry reshaping, we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization, enhancing the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced memory cost, a $25 \times$ reduction in training time, and over $3000 \times$ faster rendering speed.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated good zero-shot learning performance in the unsupervised domain adaptation task. Yet, most transfer approaches for VLMs focus on either the language or visual branches, overlooking the nuanced interplay between both modalities. In this work, we introduce a Unified Modality Separation (UniMoS) framework for unsupervised domain adaptation. Leveraging insights from modality gap studies, we craft a nimble modality separation network that distinctly disentangles CLIP's features into language-associated and vision-associated components. Our proposed Modality-Ensemble Training (MET) method fosters the exchange of modality-agnostic information while maintaining modality-specific nuances. We align features across domains using a modality discriminator. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmarks reveal our approach sets a new state-of-the-art with minimal computational costs.

- **Summary**: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a promising technology that captures physiological signals from face videos, with potential applications in medical health, emotional computing, and biosecurity recognition. The demand for rPPG tasks has expanded from demonstrating good performance on intra-dataset testing to cross-dataset testing (i.e., domain generalization). However, most existing methods have overlooked the prior knowledge of rPPG, resulting in poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously utilizes explicit and implicit prior knowledge in the rPPG task. Specifically, we systematically analyze the causes of noise sources (e.g., different camera, lighting, skin types, and movement) across different domains and incorporate these prior knowledge into the network. Additionally, we leverage a two-branch network to disentangle the physiological feature distribution from noises through implicit label correlation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB cross-dataset evaluation but also generalizes well from RGB datasets to NIR datasets.

- **Summary**: Purpose: To investigate whether Fractal Dimension (FD)-based oculomics could be used for individual risk prediction by evaluating repeatability and robustness. Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter {\lambda} which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p<0.0001). Median {\lambda} in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\% for DART and 12.65\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\% and 6.64\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with {\lambda} (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p<0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods.

- **Summary**: The diffusion-based text-to-image model harbors immense potential in transferring reference style. However, current encoder-based approaches significantly impair the text controllability of text-to-image models while transferring styles. In this paper, we introduce DEADiff to address this issue using the following two strategies: 1) a mechanism to decouple the style and semantics of reference images. The decoupled feature representations are first extracted by Q-Formers which are instructed by different text descriptions. Then they are injected into mutually exclusive subsets of cross-attention layers for better disentanglement. 2) A non-reconstructive learning method. The Q-Formers are trained using paired images rather than the identical target, in which the reference image and the ground-truth image are with the same style or semantics. We show that DEADiff attains the best visual stylization results and optimal balance between the text controllability inherent in the text-to-image model and style similarity to the reference image, as demonstrated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in creating images from text descriptions. However, these T2I generation models often fall short of generating images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects. In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging. First, SELMA leverages an LLM's in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts. Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging. Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets. We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation. Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models.

- **Summary**: Purpose: Advances in deep learning have resulted in effective models for surgical video analysis; however, these models often fail to generalize across medical centers due to domain shift caused by variations in surgical workflow, camera setups, and patient demographics. Recently, object-centric learning has emerged as a promising approach for improved surgical scene understanding, capturing and disentangling visual and semantic properties of surgical tools and anatomy to improve downstream task performance. In this work, we conduct a multi-centric performance benchmark of object-centric approaches, focusing on Critical View of Safety assessment in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, then propose an improved approach for unseen domain generalization.   Methods: We evaluate four object-centric approaches for domain generalization, establishing baseline performance. Next, leveraging the disentangled nature of object-centric representations, we dissect one of these methods through a series of ablations (e.g. ignoring either visual or semantic features for downstream classification). Finally, based on the results of these ablations, we develop an optimized method specifically tailored for domain generalization, LG-DG, that includes a novel disentanglement loss function.   Results: Our optimized approach, LG-DG, achieves an improvement of 9.28% over the best baseline approach. More broadly, we show that object-centric approaches are highly effective for domain generalization thanks to their modular approach to representation learning.   Conclusion: We investigate the use of object-centric methods for unseen domain generalization, identify method-agnostic factors critical for performance, and present an optimized approach that substantially outperforms existing methods.

- **Summary**: Deployments of artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics mandate not just accuracy and efficacy but also trust, emphasizing the need for explainability in machine decisions. The recent trend in automated medical image diagnostics leans towards the deployment of Transformer-based architectures, credited to their impressive capabilities. Since the self-attention feature of transformers contributes towards identifying crucial regions during the classification process, they enhance the trustability of the methods. However, the complex intricacies of these attention mechanisms may fall short of effectively pinpointing the regions of interest directly influencing AI decisions. Our research endeavors to innovate a unique attention block that underscores the correlation between 'regions' rather than 'pixels'. To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative system grounded in prototype learning, featuring an advanced self-attention mechanism that goes beyond conventional ad-hoc visual explanation techniques by offering comprehensible visual insights. A combined quantitative and qualitative methodological approach was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the large-scale NIH chest X-ray dataset. Experimental results showed that our proposed method offers a promising direction for explainability, which can lead to the development of more trustable systems, which can facilitate easier and rapid adoption of such technology into routine clinics.

- **Summary**: We present Bayesian Diffusion Models (BDM), a prediction algorithm that performs effective Bayesian inference by tightly coupling the top-down (prior) information with the bottom-up (data-driven) procedure via joint diffusion processes. We show the effectiveness of BDM on the 3D shape reconstruction task. Compared to prototypical deep learning data-driven approaches trained on paired (supervised) data-labels (e.g. image-point clouds) datasets, our BDM brings in rich prior information from standalone labels (e.g. point clouds) to improve the bottom-up 3D reconstruction. As opposed to the standard Bayesian frameworks where explicit prior and likelihood are required for the inference, BDM performs seamless information fusion via coupled diffusion processes with learned gradient computation networks. The specialty of our BDM lies in its capability to engage the active and effective information exchange and fusion of the top-down and bottom-up processes where each itself is a diffusion process. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks for 3D shape reconstruction.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a new framework for online 3D scene perception. Conventional 3D scene perception methods are offline, i.e., take an already reconstructed 3D scene geometry as input, which is not applicable in robotic applications where the input data is streaming RGB-D videos rather than a complete 3D scene reconstructed from pre-collected RGB-D videos. To deal with online 3D scene perception tasks where data collection and perception should be performed simultaneously, the model should be able to process 3D scenes frame by frame and make use of the temporal information. To this end, we propose an adapter-based plug-and-play module for the backbone of 3D scene perception model, which constructs memory to cache and aggregate the extracted RGB-D features to empower offline models with temporal learning ability. Specifically, we propose a queued memory mechanism to cache the supporting point cloud and image features. Then we devise aggregation modules which directly perform on the memory and pass temporal information to current frame. We further propose 3D-to-2D adapter to enhance image features with strong global context. Our adapters can be easily inserted into mainstream offline architectures of different tasks and significantly boost their performance on online tasks. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and SceneNN datasets demonstrate our approach achieves leading performance on three 3D scene perception tasks compared with state-of-the-art online methods by simply finetuning existing offline models, without any model and task-specific designs. \href{https://xuxw98.github.io/Online3D/}{Project page}.

- **Summary**: Image inpainting, the process of restoring corrupted images, has seen significant advancements with the advent of diffusion models (DMs). Despite these advancements, current DM adaptations for inpainting, which involve modifications to the sampling strategy or the development of inpainting-specific DMs, frequently suffer from semantic inconsistencies and reduced image quality. Addressing these challenges, our work introduces a novel paradigm: the division of masked image features and noisy latent into separate branches. This division dramatically diminishes the model's learning load, facilitating a nuanced incorporation of essential masked image information in a hierarchical fashion. Herein, we present BrushNet, a novel plug-and-play dual-branch model engineered to embed pixel-level masked image features into any pre-trained DM, guaranteeing coherent and enhanced image inpainting outcomes. Additionally, we introduce BrushData and BrushBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and performance assessment. Our extensive experimental analysis demonstrates BrushNet's superior performance over existing models across seven key metrics, including image quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.

The proposed VideoMamba overcomes the limitations of existing 3D convolution neural networks and video transformers. Its linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-term modeling, which is crucial for high-resolution long video understanding. Extensive evaluations reveal VideoMamba's four core abilities: (1) Scalability in the visual domain without extensive dataset pretraining, thanks to a novel self-distillation technique; (2) Sensitivity for recognizing short-term actions even with fine-grained motion differences; (3) Superiority in long-term video understanding, showcasing significant advancements over traditional feature-based models; and (4) Compatibility with other modalities, demonstrating robustness in multi-modal contexts. Through these distinct advantages, VideoMamba sets a new benchmark for video understanding, offering a scalable and efficient solution for comprehensive video understanding.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Attention Prompt Tuning (APT) - a computationally efficient variant of prompt tuning for video-based applications such as action recognition. Prompt tuning approaches involve injecting a set of learnable prompts along with data tokens during fine-tuning while keeping the backbone frozen. This approach greatly reduces the number of learnable parameters compared to full tuning. For image-based downstream tasks, normally a couple of learnable prompts achieve results close to those of full tuning. However, videos, which contain more complex spatiotemporal information, require hundreds of tunable prompts to achieve reasonably good results. This reduces the parameter efficiency observed in images and significantly increases latency and the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) during inference. To tackle these issues, we directly inject the prompts into the keys and values of the non-local attention mechanism within the transformer block. Additionally, we introduce a novel prompt reparameterization technique to make APT more robust against hyperparameter selection. The proposed APT approach greatly reduces the number of FLOPs and latency while achieving a significant performance boost over the existing parameter-efficient tuning methods on UCF101, HMDB51, and SSv2 datasets for action recognition.

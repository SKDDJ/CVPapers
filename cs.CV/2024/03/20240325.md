- **Summary**: The effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) heavily relies on the abundance and accuracy of available training data. However, collecting and annotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive, particularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with their duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various scenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when dealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different devices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion (SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new informative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based on natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant GPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we introduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method tailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective fine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\% of parameters compared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset diversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process prompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across different images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making processes regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial role than intensity. In conclusion, our pipeline not only outperforms classifiers trained on the original dataset but also demonstrates superior performance when encountering unseen datasets.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving systems require extensive data collection schemes to cover the diverse scenarios needed for building a robust and safe system. The data volumes are in the order of Exabytes and have to be stored for a long period of time (i.e., more than 10 years of the vehicle's life cycle). Lossless compression doesn't provide sufficient compression ratios, hence, lossy video compression has been explored. It is essential to prove that lossy video compression artifacts do not impact the performance of the perception algorithms. However, there is limited work in this area to provide a solid conclusion. In particular, there is no such work for fisheye cameras, which have high radial distortion and where compression may have higher artifacts. Fisheye cameras are commonly used in automotive systems for 3D object detection task. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of standard video compression codecs on wide FOV fisheye camera images. We demonstrate that the achievable compression with negligible impact depends on the dataset and temporal prediction of the video codec. We propose a radial distortion-aware zonal metric to evaluate the performance of artifacts in fisheye images. In addition, we present a novel method for estimating affine mode parameters of the latest VVC codec, and suggest some areas for improvement in video codecs for the application to fisheye imagery.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to finely segment various organs. It requires grasping global information from both parts and the entire image for better segmenting, and clinically there are often certain requirements for segmentation efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made considerable achievements in MIS. However, they are difficult to fully collect global context information and their pooling layer may cause information loss. Capsule networks, which combine the benefits of CNNs while taking into account additional information such as relative location that CNNs do not, have lately demonstrated some advantages in MIS. Vision Transformer (ViT) employs transformers in visual tasks. Transformer based on attention mechanism has excellent global inductive modeling capabilities and is expected to capture longrange information. Moreover, there have been resent studies on making ViT more lightweight to minimize model complexity and increase efficiency. In this paper, we propose a U-shaped 3D encoder-decoder network named 3D-EffiViTCaps, which combines 3D capsule blocks with 3D EfficientViT blocks for MIS. Our encoder uses capsule blocks and EfficientViT blocks to jointly capture local and global semantic information more effectively and efficiently with less information loss, while the decoder employs CNN blocks and EfficientViT blocks to catch ffner details for segmentation. We conduct experiments on various datasets, including iSeg-2017, Hippocampus and Cardiac to verify the performance and efficiency of 3D-EffiViTCaps, which performs better than previous 3D CNN-based, 3D Capsule-based and 3D Transformer-based models. We further implement a series of ablation experiments on the main blocks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/HidNeuron/3D-EffiViTCaps.

- **Summary**: Graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in learning graph representations, especially graph Transformer, which has recently shown superior performance on various graph mining tasks. However, graph Transformer generally treats nodes as tokens, which results in quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes during self-attention computation. The graph MLP Mixer addresses this challenge by using the efficient MLP Mixer technique from computer vision. However, the time-consuming process of extracting graph tokens limits its performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture named ChebMixer, a newly graph MLP Mixer that uses fast Chebyshev polynomials-based spectral filtering to extract a sequence of tokens. Firstly, we produce multiscale representations of graph nodes via fast Chebyshev polynomial-based spectral filtering. Next, we consider each node's multiscale representations as a sequence of tokens and refine the node representation with an effective MLP Mixer. Finally, we aggregate the multiscale representations of nodes through Chebyshev interpolation. Owing to the powerful representation capabilities and fast computational properties of MLP Mixer, we can quickly extract more informative node representations to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The experimental results prove our significant improvements in a variety of scenarios ranging from graph node classification to medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D CBCT) provides respiration-resolved images and can be used for image-guided radiation therapy. However, the ability to reveal respiratory motion comes at the cost of image artifacts. As raw projection data are sorted into multiple respiratory phases, there is a limited number of cone-beam projections available for image reconstruction. Consequently, the 4D CBCT images are covered by severe streak artifacts. Although several deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this issue, most algorithms employ ordinary network models, neglecting the intrinsic structural prior within 4D CBCT images. In this paper, we first explore the origin and appearance of streak artifacts in 4D CBCT images.Specifically, we find that streak artifacts exhibit a periodic rotational motion along with the patient's respiration. This unique motion pattern inspires us to distinguish the artifacts from the desired anatomical structures in the spatiotemporal domain. Thereafter, we propose a spatiotemporal neural network named RSTAR-Net with separable and circular convolutions for Rotational Streak Artifact Reduction. The specially designed model effectively encodes dynamic image features, facilitating the recovery of 4D CBCT images. Moreover, RSTAR-Net is also lightweight and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and RSTAR-Net shows superior performance to comparison methods.

- **Summary**: Modern neural networks are often trained on massive datasets that are web scraped with minimal human inspection. As a result of this insecure curation pipeline, an adversary can poison or backdoor the resulting model by uploading malicious data to the internet and waiting for a victim to scrape and train on it. Existing approaches for creating poisons and backdoors start with randomly sampled clean data, called base samples, and then modify those samples to craft poisons. However, some base samples may be significantly more amenable to poisoning than others. As a result, we may be able to craft more potent poisons by carefully choosing the base samples. In this work, we use guided diffusion to synthesize base samples from scratch that lead to significantly more potent poisons and backdoors than previous state-of-the-art attacks. Our Guided Diffusion Poisoning (GDP) base samples can be combined with any downstream poisoning or backdoor attack to boost its effectiveness. Our implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hsouri/GDP .

- **Summary**: In image restoration (IR), leveraging semantic priors from segmentation models has been a common approach to improve performance. The recent segment anything model (SAM) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting advanced semantic priors to enhance IR tasks. However, the computational cost of SAM is prohibitive for IR, compared to existing smaller IR models. The incorporation of SAM for extracting semantic priors considerably hampers the model inference efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a general framework to distill SAM's semantic knowledge to boost exiting IR models without interfering with their inference process. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of the semantic priors fusion (SPF) scheme and the semantic priors distillation (SPD) scheme. SPF fuses two kinds of information between the restored image predicted by the original IR model and the semantic mask predicted by SAM for the refined restored image. SPD leverages a self-distillation manner to distill the fused semantic priors to boost the performance of original IR models. Additionally, we design a semantic-guided relation (SGR) module for SPD, which ensures semantic feature representation space consistency to fully distill the priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple IR models and tasks, including deraining, deblurring, and denoising.

- **Summary**: This paper tackles a novel yet challenging problem: how to transfer knowledge from the emerging Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- which reveals impressive zero-shot instance segmentation capacity -- to learn a compact panoramic semantic segmentation model, i.e., student, without requiring any labeled data. This poses considerable challenges due to SAM's inability to provide semantic labels and the large capacity gap between SAM and the student. To this end, we propose a novel framework, called GoodSAM, that introduces a teacher assistant (TA) to provide semantic information, integrated with SAM to generate ensemble logits to achieve knowledge transfer. Specifically, we propose a Distortion-Aware Rectification (DAR) module that first addresses the distortion problem of panoramic images by imposing prediction-level consistency and boundary enhancement. This subtly enhances TA's prediction capacity on panoramic images. DAR then incorporates a cross-task complementary fusion block to adaptively merge the predictions of SAM and TA to obtain more reliable ensemble logits. Moreover, we introduce a Multi-level Knowledge Adaptation (MKA) module to efficiently transfer the multi-level feature knowledge from TA and ensemble logits to learn a compact student model. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that our GoodSAM achieves a remarkable +3.75\% mIoU improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods. Also, our most lightweight model achieves comparable performance to the SOTA methods with only 3.7M parameters.



### Elite360D: Towards Efficient 360 Depth Estimation via Semantic- and Distance-Aware Bi-Projection Fusion

- **Summary**: 360 depth estimation has recently received great attention for 3D reconstruction owing to its omnidirectional field of view (FoV). Recent approaches are predominantly focused on cross-projection fusion with geometry-based re-projection: they fuse 360 images with equirectangular projection (ERP) and another projection type, e.g., cubemap projection to estimate depth with the ERP format. However, these methods suffer from 1) limited local receptive fields, making it hardly possible to capture large FoV scenes, and 2) prohibitive computational cost, caused by the complex cross-projection fusion module design. In this paper, we propose Elite360D, a novel framework that inputs the ERP image and icosahedron projection (ICOSAP) point set, which is undistorted and spatially continuous. Elite360D is superior in its capacity in learning a representation from a local-with-global perspective. With a flexible ERP image encoder, it includes an ICOSAP point encoder, and a Bi-projection Bi-attention Fusion (B2F) module (totally ~1M parameters). Specifically, the ERP image encoder can take various perspective image-trained backbones (e.g., ResNet, Transformer) to extract local features. The point encoder extracts the global features from the ICOSAP. Then, the B2F module captures the semantic- and distance-aware dependencies between each pixel of the ERP feature and the entire ICOSAP feature set. Without specific backbone design and obvious computational cost increase, Elite360D outperforms the prior arts on several benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of text-to-image generative models. Evaluating the quality of the generative models is one essential step in the development process. Unfortunately, the evaluation process could consume a significant amount of computational resources, making the required periodic evaluation of model performance (e.g., monitoring training progress) impractical. Therefore, we seek to improve the evaluation efficiency by selecting the representative subset of the text-image dataset. We systematically investigate the design choices, including the selection criteria (textural features or image-based metrics) and the selection granularity (prompt-level or set-level). We find that the insights from prior work on subset selection for training data do not generalize to this problem, and we propose FlashEval, an iterative search algorithm tailored to evaluation data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlashEval on ranking diffusion models with various configurations, including architectures, quantization levels, and sampler schedules on COCO and DiffusionDB datasets. Our searched 50-item subset could achieve comparable evaluation quality to the randomly sampled 500-item subset for COCO annotations on unseen models, achieving a 10x evaluation speedup. We release the condensed subset of these commonly used datasets to help facilitate diffusion algorithm design and evaluation, and open-source FlashEval as a tool for condensing future datasets, accessible at https://github.com/thu-nics/FlashEval.

- **Summary**: Ultrasound imaging is crucial for evaluating organ morphology and function, yet depth adjustment can degrade image quality and field-of-view, presenting a depth-dependent dilemma. Traditional interpolation-based zoom-in techniques often sacrifice detail and introduce artifacts. Motivated by the potential of arbitrary-scale super-resolution to naturally address these inherent challenges, we present the Residual Dense Swin Transformer Network (RDSTN), designed to capture the non-local characteristics and long-range dependencies intrinsic to ultrasound images. It comprises a linear embedding module for feature enhancement, an encoder with shifted-window attention for modeling non-locality, and an MLP decoder for continuous detail reconstruction. This strategy streamlines balancing image quality and field-of-view, which offers superior textures over traditional methods. Experimentally, RDSTN outperforms existing approaches while requiring fewer parameters. In conclusion, RDSTN shows promising potential for ultrasound image enhancement by overcoming the limitations of conventional interpolation-based methods and achieving depth-independent imaging.



### Synthesize Step-by-Step: Tools, Templates and LLMs as Data Generators for Reasoning-Based Chart VQA

- **Summary**: Understanding data visualizations like charts and plots requires reasoning about both visual elements and numerics. Although strong in extractive questions, current chart visual question answering (chart VQA) models suffer on complex reasoning questions. In this work, we address the lack of reasoning ability by data augmentation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown to have strong reasoning ability, as an automatic data annotator that generates question-answer annotations for chart images. The key innovation in our method lies in the Synthesize Step-by-Step strategy: our LLM-based data generator learns to decompose the complex question into step-by-step sub-questions (rationales), which are then used to derive the final answer using external tools, i.e. Python. This step-wise generation procedure is trained on synthetic data generated using a template-based QA generation pipeline. Experimental results highlight the significance of the proposed step-by-step generation. By training with the LLM-augmented data (LAMENDA), we significantly enhance the chart VQA models, achieving the state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartQA and PlotQA datasets. In particular, our approach improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art approach from 38% to 54% on the human-written questions in the ChartQA dataset, which needs strong reasoning. We hope our work underscores the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of data augmentation using LLMs for reasoning-heavy tasks.

- **Summary**: Medical report generation has achieved remarkable advancements yet has still been faced with several challenges. First, the inherent imbalance in the distribution of normal and abnormal cases may lead models to exhibit a biased focus on normal samples, resulting in unreliable diagnoses. Second, the frequent occurrence of common template sentences in the reports may overwhelm the critical abnormal information. Moreover, existing works focus on 2D chest X-rays, leaving CT report generation underexplored due to the high-dimensional nature of CT images and the limited availability of CT-report pairs. Recently, LLM has shown a great ability to generate reliable answers with appropriate prompts, which shed light on addressing the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose Dia-LLaMA, a framework to adapt the LLaMA2-7B for CT report generation by incorporating diagnostic information as guidance prompts. Considering the high dimension of CT, we leverage a pre-trained ViT3D with perceiver to extract the visual information. To tailor the LLM for report generation and emphasize abnormality, we extract additional diagnostic information by referring to a disease prototype memory bank, which is updated during training to capture common disease representations. Furthermore, we introduce disease-aware attention to enable the model to adjust attention for different diseases. Experiments on the chest CT dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed previous methods and achieved state-of-the-art on both clinical efficacy performance and natural language generation metrics. The code will be made publically available.

- **Summary**: Image fusion aims to combine information from different source images to create a comprehensively representative image. Existing fusion methods are typically helpless in dealing with degradations in low-quality source images and non-interactive to multiple subjective and objective needs. To solve them, we introduce a novel approach that leverages semantic text guidance image fusion model for degradation-aware and interactive image fusion task, termed as Text-IF. It innovatively extends the classical image fusion to the text guided image fusion along with the ability to harmoniously address the degradation and interaction issues during fusion. Through the text semantic encoder and semantic interaction fusion decoder, Text-IF is accessible to the all-in-one infrared and visible image degradation-aware processing and the interactive flexible fusion outcomes. In this way, Text-IF achieves not only multi-modal image fusion, but also multi-modal information fusion. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed text guided image fusion strategy has obvious advantages over SOTA methods in the image fusion performance and degradation treatment. The code is available at https://github.com/XunpengYi/Text-IF.

- **Summary**: Classification-regression prediction networks have realized impressive success in several modern deep trackers. However, there is an inherent difference between classification and regression tasks, so they have diverse even opposite demands for feature matching. Existed models always ignore the key issue and only employ a unified matching block in two task branches, decaying the decision quality. Besides, these models also struggle with decision misalignment situation. In this paper, we propose a multi-attention associate prediction network (MAPNet) to tackle the above problems. Concretely, two novel matchers, i.e., category-aware matcher and spatial-aware matcher, are first designed for feature comparison by integrating self, cross, channel or spatial attentions organically. They are capable of fully capturing the category-related semantics for classification and the local spatial contexts for regression, respectively. Then, we present a dual alignment module to enhance the correspondences between two branches, which is useful to find the optimal tracking solution. Finally, we describe a Siamese tracker built upon the proposed prediction network, which achieves the leading performance on five tracking benchmarks, consisting of LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2k and UAV123, and surpasses other state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: In medical and industrial domains, providing guidance for assembly processes is critical to ensure efficiency and safety. Errors in assembly can lead to significant consequences such as extended surgery times, and prolonged manufacturing or maintenance times in industry. Assembly scenarios can benefit from in-situ AR visualization to provide guidance, reduce assembly times and minimize errors. To enable in-situ visualization 6D pose estimation can be leveraged. Existing 6D pose estimation techniques primarily focus on individual objects and static captures. However, assembly scenarios have various dynamics including occlusion during assembly and dynamics in the assembly objects appearance. Existing work, combining object detection/6D pose estimation and assembly state detection focuses either on pure deep learning-based approaches, or limit the assembly state detection to building blocks. To address the challenges of 6D pose estimation in combination with assembly state detection, our approach ASDF builds upon the strengths of YOLOv8, a real-time capable object detection framework. We extend this framework, refine the object pose and fuse pose knowledge with network-detected pose information. Utilizing our late fusion in our Pose2State module results in refined 6D pose estimation and assembly state detection. By combining both pose and state information, our Pose2State module predicts the final assembly state with precision. Our evaluation on our ASDF dataset shows that our Pose2State module leads to an improved assembly state detection and that the improvement of the assembly state further leads to a more robust 6D pose estimation. Moreover, on the GBOT dataset, we outperform the pure deep learning-based network, and even outperform the hybrid and pure tracking-based approaches.

- **Summary**: The integration of an ensemble of deep learning models has been extensively explored to enhance defense against adversarial attacks. The diversity among sub-models increases the attack cost required to deceive the majority of the ensemble, thereby improving the adversarial robustness. While existing approaches mainly center on increasing diversity in feature representations or dispersion of first-order gradients with respect to input, the limited correlation between these diversity metrics and adversarial robustness constrains the performance of ensemble adversarial defense. In this work, we aim to enhance ensemble diversity by reducing attack transferability. We identify second-order gradients, which depict the loss curvature, as a key factor in adversarial robustness. Computing the Hessian matrix involved in second-order gradients is computationally expensive. To address this, we approximate the Hessian-vector product using differential approximation. Given that low curvature provides better robustness, our ensemble model was designed to consider the influence of curvature among different sub-models. We introduce a novel regularizer to train multiple more-diverse low-curvature network models. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that our ensemble model exhibits superior robustness against a range of attacks, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: As a neuromorphic sensor with high temporal resolution, spike cameras offer notable advantages over traditional cameras in high-speed vision applications such as high-speed optical estimation, depth estimation, and object tracking. Inspired by the success of the spike camera, we proposed Spike-NeRF, the first Neural Radiance Field derived from spike data, to achieve 3D reconstruction and novel viewpoint synthesis of high-speed scenes. Instead of the multi-view images at the same time of NeRF, the inputs of Spike-NeRF are continuous spike streams captured by a moving spike camera in a very short time. To reconstruct a correct and stable 3D scene from high-frequency but unstable spike data, we devised spike masks along with a distinctive loss function. We evaluate our method qualitatively and numerically on several challenging synthetic scenes generated by blender with the spike camera simulator. Our results demonstrate that Spike-NeRF produces more visually appealing results than the existing methods and the baseline we proposed in high-speed scenes. Our code and data will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to establish point-wise correspondences between source and target point clouds. Existing methods obtain correspondences directly by computing point-wise feature similarity between point clouds. However, non-rigid objects possess strong deformability and unusual shapes, making it a longstanding challenge to directly establish correspondences between point clouds with unconventional shapes. To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised Template-Assisted point cloud shape correspondence Network, termed TANet, including a template generation module and a template assistance module. The proposed TANet enjoys several merits. Firstly, the template generation module establishes a set of learnable templates with explicit structures. Secondly, we introduce a template assistance module that extensively leverages the generated templates to establish more accurate shape correspondences from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments on four human and animal datasets demonstrate that TANet achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Over the past few years, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation approaches based on diffusion models have gained significant attention. However, vanilla diffusion models often suffer from spelling inaccuracies in the text displayed within the generated images. The capability to generate visual text is crucial, offering both academic interest and a wide range of practical applications. To produce accurate visual text images, state-of-the-art techniques adopt a glyph-controlled image generation approach, consisting of a text layout generator followed by an image generator that is conditioned on the generated text layout. Nevertheless, our study reveals that these models still face three primary challenges, prompting us to develop a testbed to facilitate future research. We introduce a benchmark, LenCom-Eval, specifically designed for testing models' capability in generating images with Lengthy and Complex visual text. Subsequently, we introduce a training-free framework to enhance the two-stage generation approaches. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on both LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval benchmarks and demonstrate notable improvements across a range of evaluation metrics, including CLIPScore, OCR precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and edit distance scores. For instance, our proposed framework improves the backbone model, TextDiffuser, by more than 23\% and 13.5\% in terms of OCR word F1 on LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval, respectively. Our work makes a unique contribution to the field by focusing on generating images with long and rare text sequences, a niche previously unexplored by existing literature



### Enhancing Visual Place Recognition via Fast and Slow Adaptive Biasing in Event Cameras

- **Summary**: Event cameras are increasingly popular in robotics due to their beneficial features, such as low latency, energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Nevertheless, their downstream task performance is greatly influenced by the optimization of bias parameters. These parameters, for instance, regulate the necessary change in light intensity to trigger an event, which in turn depends on factors such as the environment lighting and camera motion. This paper introduces feedback control algorithms that automatically tune the bias parameters through two interacting methods: 1) An immediate, on-the-fly fast adaptation of the refractory period, which sets the minimum interval between consecutive events, and 2) if the event rate exceeds the specified bounds even after changing the refractory period repeatedly, the controller adapts the pixel bandwidth and event thresholds, which stabilizes after a short period of noise events across all pixels (slow adaptation). Our evaluation focuses on the visual place recognition task, where incoming query images are compared to a given reference database. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our algorithms' adaptive feedback control in real-time. To do so, we collected the QCR-Fast-and-Slow dataset that contains DAVIS346 event camera streams from 366 repeated traversals of a Scout Mini robot navigating through a 100 meter long indoor lab setting (totaling over 35km distance traveled) in varying brightness conditions with ground truth location information. Our proposed feedback controllers result in superior performance when compared to the standard bias settings and prior feedback control methods. Our findings also detail the impact of bias adjustments on task performance and feature ablation studies on the fast and slow adaptation mechanisms.

- **Summary**: We interact with the world with our hands and see it through our own (egocentric) perspective. A holistic 3D understanding of such interactions from egocentric views is important for tasks in robotics, AR/VR, action recognition and motion generation. Accurately reconstructing such interactions in 3D is challenging due to heavy occlusion, viewpoint bias, camera distortion, and motion blur from the head movement. To this end, we designed the HANDS23 challenge based on the AssemblyHands and ARCTIC datasets with carefully designed training and testing splits. Based on the results of the top submitted methods and more recent baselines on the leaderboards, we perform a thorough analysis on 3D hand(-object) reconstruction tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of addressing distortion specific to egocentric cameras, adopting high-capacity transformers to learn complex hand-object interactions, and fusing predictions from different views. Our study further reveals challenging scenarios intractable with state-of-the-art methods, such as fast hand motion, object reconstruction from narrow egocentric views, and close contact between two hands and objects. Our efforts will enrich the community's knowledge foundation and facilitate future hand studies on egocentric hand-object interactions.

- **Summary**: Point scene understanding is a challenging task to process real-world scene point cloud, which aims at segmenting each object, estimating its pose, and reconstructing its mesh simultaneously. Recent state-of-the-art method first segments each object and then processes them independently with multiple stages for the different sub-tasks. This leads to a complex pipeline to optimize and makes it hard to leverage the relationship constraints between multiple objects. In this work, we propose a novel Disentangled Object-Centric TRansformer (DOCTR) that explores object-centric representation to facilitate learning with multiple objects for the multiple sub-tasks in a unified manner. Each object is represented as a query, and a Transformer decoder is adapted to iteratively optimize all the queries involving their relationship. In particular, we introduce a semantic-geometry disentangled query (SGDQ) design that enables the query features to attend separately to semantic information and geometric information relevant to the corresponding sub-tasks. A hybrid bipartite matching module is employed to well use the supervisions from all the sub-tasks during training. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging ScanNet dataset.

- **Summary**: In voltage imaging, where the membrane potentials of individual neurons are recorded at from hundreds to thousand frames per second using fluorescence microscopy, data processing presents a challenge. Even a fraction of a minute of recording with a limited image size yields gigabytes of video data consisting of tens of thousands of frames, which can be time-consuming to process. Moreover, millisecond-level short exposures lead to noisy video frames, obscuring neuron footprints especially in deep-brain samples where noisy signals are buried in background fluorescence. To address this challenge, we propose a fast neuron segmentation method able to detect multiple, potentially overlapping, spiking neurons from noisy video frames, and implement a data processing pipeline incorporating the proposed segmentation method along with GPU-accelerated motion correction. By testing on existing datasets as well as on new datasets we introduce, we show that our pipeline extracts neuron footprints that agree well with human annotation even from cluttered datasets, and demonstrate real-time processing of voltage imaging data on a single desktop computer for the first time.

- **Summary**: High-definition (HD) maps have played an integral role in the development of modern autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks, albeit with high associated labeling and maintenance costs. As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

- **Summary**: Three-dimensional object detection is one of the key tasks in autonomous driving. To reduce costs in practice, low-cost multi-view cameras for 3D object detection are proposed to replace the expansive LiDAR sensors. However, relying solely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object detection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras with the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable multi-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a radar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction. RadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section (RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based encoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features, with an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the two encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to scattering the point feature in BEV. Besides, we present the Cross-Attention Multi-layer Fusion module to automatically align the multi-modal BEV feature from radar and camera with the deformable attention mechanism, and then fuse the feature with channel and spatial fusion layers. Experimental results show that RCBEVDet achieves new state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion results on nuScenes and view-of-delft (VoD) 3D object detection benchmarks. Furthermore, RCBEVDet achieves better 3D detection results than all real-time camera-only and radar-camera 3D object detectors with a faster inference speed at 21~28 FPS.

- **Summary**: Recent works often assume that Vision-Language Model (VLM) representations are based on visual attributes like shape. However, it is unclear to what extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize important textual features for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate the important features for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify the features that contribute to VLM representations. We find that spurious descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly, among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual attributes like habitat to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis reveals that different VLMs prioritize different attributes in their representations. Overall, we show that VLMs do not simply match images to scene descriptions and that non-visual or even spurious descriptions significantly influence their representations.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised person re-identification aims to retrieve images of a specified person without identity labels. Many recent unsupervised Re-ID approaches adopt clustering-based methods to measure cross-camera feature similarity to roughly divide images into clusters. They ignore the feature distribution discrepancy induced by camera domain gap, resulting in the unavoidable performance degradation. Camera information is usually available, and the feature distribution in the single camera usually focuses more on the appearance of the individual and has less intra-identity variance. Inspired by the observation, we introduce a \textbf{C}amera-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{L}abel \textbf{R}efinement~(CALR) framework that reduces camera discrepancy by clustering intra-camera similarity. Specifically, we employ intra-camera training to obtain reliable local pseudo labels within each camera, and then refine global labels generated by inter-camera clustering and train the discriminative model using more reliable global pseudo labels in a self-paced manner. Meanwhile, we develop a camera-alignment module to align feature distributions under different cameras, which could help deal with the camera variance further. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches. The code is accessible at https://github.com/leeBooMla/CALR.

- **Summary**: This work tackles the challenging task of achieving real-time novel view synthesis on various scenes, including highly reflective objects and unbounded outdoor scenes. Existing real-time rendering methods, especially those based on meshes, often have subpar performance in modeling surfaces with rich view-dependent appearances. Our key idea lies in leveraging meshes for rendering acceleration while incorporating a novel approach to parameterize view-dependent information. We decompose the color into diffuse and specular, and model the specular color in the reflected direction based on a neural environment map. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable reconstruction quality for highly reflective surfaces compared to state-of-the-art offline methods, while also efficiently enabling real-time rendering on edge devices such as smartphones.

- **Summary**: We present CT-Bound, a fast boundary estimation method for noisy images using a hybrid Convolution and Transformer neural network. The proposed architecture decomposes boundary estimation into two tasks: local detection and global regularization of image boundaries. It first estimates a parametric representation of boundary structures only using the input image within a small receptive field and then refines the boundary structure in the parameter domain without accessing the input image. Because of this, a part of the network can be easily trained using naive, synthetic images and still generalized to real images, and the entire architecture is computationally efficient as the boundary refinement is non-iterative and not in the image domain. Compared with the previous highest accuracy methods, our experiment shows that CT-Bound is 100 times faster, producing comparably accurate, high-quality boundary and color maps. We also demonstrate that CT-Bound can produce boundary and color maps on real captured images without extra fine-tuning and real-time boundary map and color map videos at ten frames per second.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: As natural image understanding moves towards the pretrain-finetune era, research in pathology imaging is concurrently evolving. Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code will be available upon acceptance.



### Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Data with Anatomy-Oriented Imaging Planes

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pretraining deep networks on unlabeled data, prior to transfer learning of target tasks with limited annotation. The relevance between the pretraining pretext and target tasks is crucial to the success of transfer learning. Various pretext tasks have been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three dimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic ones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data with anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging views. As these imaging planes are defined according to the anatomy of the imaged organ, pretext tasks effectively exploiting this information can pretrain the networks to gain knowledge on the organ of interest. In this work, we propose two complementary pretext tasks for this group of medical image data based on the spatial relationship of the imaging planes. The first is to learn the relative orientation between the imaging planes and implemented as regressing their intersecting lines. The second exploits parallel imaging planes to regress their relative slice locations within a stack. Both pretext tasks are conceptually straightforward and easy to implement, and can be combined in multitask learning for better representation learning. Thorough experiments on two anatomical structures (heart and knee) and representative target tasks (semantic segmentation and classification) demonstrate that the proposed pretext tasks are effective in pretraining deep networks for remarkably boosted performance on the target tasks, and superior to other recent approaches.

- **Summary**: Medical image registration is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment with its ability to merge diverse information of images, which may be captured under different times, angles, or modalities. Although several surveys have reviewed the development of medical image registration, these surveys have not systematically summarized methodologies of existing medical image registration methods. To this end, we provide a comprehensive review of these methods from traditional and deep learning-based directions, aiming to help audiences understand the development of medical image registration quickly. In particular, we review recent advances in retinal image registration at the end of each section, which has not attracted much attention. Additionally, we also discuss the current challenges of retinal image registration and provide insights and prospects for future research.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable process of talking-head-based avatar-creating solutions, directly generating anchor-style videos with full-body motions remains challenging. In this study, we propose Make-Your-Anchor, a novel system necessitating only a one-minute video clip of an individual for training, subsequently enabling the automatic generation of anchor-style videos with precise torso and hand movements. Specifically, we finetune a proposed structure-guided diffusion model on input video to render 3D mesh conditions into human appearances. We adopt a two-stage training strategy for the diffusion model, effectively binding movements with specific appearances. To produce arbitrary long temporal video, we extend the 2D U-Net in the frame-wise diffusion model to a 3D style without additional training cost, and a simple yet effective batch-overlapped temporal denoising module is proposed to bypass the constraints on video length during inference. Finally, a novel identity-specific face enhancement module is introduced to improve the visual quality of facial regions in the output videos. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the system in terms of visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation, outperforming SOTA diffusion/non-diffusion methods.

- **Summary**: In the last few years, generative models have shown their powerful capabilities in synthesizing realistic images in both quality and diversity (i.e., facial images, and natural subjects). Unfortunately, the artifact patterns in fake images synthesized by different generative models are inconsistent, leading to the failure of previous research that relied on spotting subtle differences between real and fake. In our preliminary experiments, we find that the artifacts in fake images always change with the development of the generative model, while natural images exhibit stable statistical properties. In this paper, we employ natural traces shared only by real images as an additional predictive target in the detector. Specifically, the natural traces are learned from the wild real images and we introduce extended supervised contrastive learning to bring them closer to real images and further away from fake ones. This motivates the detector to make decisions based on the proximity of images to the natural traces. To conduct a comprehensive experiment, we built a high-quality and diverse dataset that includes generative models comprising 6 GAN and 6 diffusion models, to evaluate the effectiveness in generalizing unknown forgery techniques and robustness in surviving different transformations. Experimental results show that our proposed method gives 96.1% mAP significantly outperforms the baselines. Extensive experiments conducted on the widely recognized platform Midjourney reveal that our proposed method achieves an accuracy exceeding 78.4%, underscoring its practicality for real-world application deployment. The source code and partial self-built dataset are available in supplementary material.

- **Summary**: Prior study shows that pre-training techniques can boost the performance of visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g., locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme, facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information extraction, document classification, and document question answering.

- **Summary**: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative condition leading to cognitive and functional deterioration. Given the lack of a cure, prompt and precise AD diagnosis is vital, a complex process dependent on multiple factors and multi-modal data. While successful efforts have been made to integrate multi-modal representation learning into medical datasets, scant attention has been given to 3D medical images. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Masked Vim Autoencoder (CMViM), the first efficient representation learning method tailored for 3D multi-modal data. Our proposed framework is built on a masked Vim autoencoder to learn a unified multi-modal representation and long-dependencies contained in 3D medical images. We also introduce an intra-modal contrastive learning module to enhance the capability of the multi-modal Vim encoder for modeling the discriminative features in the same modality, and an inter-modal contrastive learning module to alleviate misaligned representation among modalities. Our framework consists of two main steps: 1) incorporate the Vision Mamba (Vim) into the mask autoencoder to reconstruct 3D masked multi-modal data efficiently. 2) align the multi-modal representations with contrastive learning mechanisms from both intra-modal and inter-modal aspects. Our framework is pre-trained and validated ADNI2 dataset and validated on the downstream task for AD classification. The proposed CMViM yields 2.7\% AUC performance improvement compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Deformable image registration plays a crucial role in medical imaging, aiding in disease diagnosis and image-guided interventions. Traditional iterative methods are slow, while deep learning (DL) accelerates solutions but faces usability and precision challenges. This study introduces a pyramid network with the enhanced motion decomposition Transformer (ModeTv2) operator, showcasing superior pairwise optimization (PO) akin to traditional methods. We re-implement ModeT operator with CUDA extensions to enhance its computational efficiency. We further propose RegHead module which refines deformation fields, improves the realism of deformation and reduces parameters. By adopting the PO, the proposed network balances accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. Extensive experiments on two public brain MRI datasets and one abdominal CT dataset demonstrate the network's suitability for PO, providing a DL model with enhanced usability and interpretability. The code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Are vision-language models (VLMs) open-set models because they are trained on internet-scale datasets? We answer this question with a clear no - VLMs introduce closed-set assumptions via their finite query set, making them vulnerable to open-set conditions. We systematically evaluate VLMs for open-set recognition and find they frequently misclassify objects not contained in their query set, leading to alarmingly low precision when tuned for high recall and vice versa. We show that naively increasing the size of the query set to contain more and more classes does not mitigate this problem, but instead causes diminishing task performance and open-set performance. We establish a revised definition of the open-set problem for the age of VLMs, define a new benchmark and evaluation protocol to facilitate standardised evaluation and research in this important area, and evaluate promising baseline approaches based on predictive uncertainty and dedicated negative embeddings on a range of VLM classifiers and object detectors.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have been widely used for conditional data cross-modal generation tasks such as text-to-image and text-to-video. However, state-of-the-art models still fail to align the generated visual concepts with high-level semantics in a language such as object count, spatial relationship, etc. We approach this problem from a multimodal data fusion perspective and investigate how different fusion strategies can affect vision-language alignment. We discover that compared to the widely used early fusion of conditioning text in a pretrained image feature space, a specially designed intermediate fusion can: (i) boost text-to-image alignment with improved generation quality and (ii) improve training and inference efficiency by reducing low-rank text-to-image attention calculations. We perform experiments using a text-to-image generation task on the MS-COCO dataset. We compare our intermediate fusion mechanism with the classic early fusion mechanism on two common conditioning methods on a U-shaped ViT backbone. Our intermediate fusion model achieves a higher CLIP Score and lower FID, with 20% reduced FLOPs, and 50% increased training speed compared to a strong U-ViT baseline with an early fusion.

- **Summary**: Combining CNNs or ViTs, with RNNs for spatiotemporal forecasting, has yielded unparalleled results in predicting temporal and spatial dynamics. However, modeling extensive global information remains a formidable challenge; CNNs are limited by their narrow receptive fields, and ViTs struggle with the intensive computational demands of their attention mechanisms. The emergence of recent Mamba-based architectures has been met with enthusiasm for their exceptional long-sequence modeling capabilities, surpassing established vision models in efficiency and accuracy, which motivates us to develop an innovative architecture tailored for spatiotemporal forecasting. In this paper, we propose the VMRNN cell, a new recurrent unit that integrates the strengths of Vision Mamba blocks with LSTM. We construct a network centered on VMRNN cells to tackle spatiotemporal prediction tasks effectively. Our extensive evaluations show that our proposed approach secures competitive results on a variety of tasks while maintaining a smaller model size.

- **Summary**: 3D visual grounding aims to identify the target object within a 3D point cloud scene referred to by a natural language description. While previous works attempt to exploit the verbo-visual relation with proposed cross-modal transformers, unstructured natural utterances and scattered objects might lead to undesirable performances. In this paper, we introduce DOrA, a novel 3D visual grounding framework with Order-Aware referring. DOrA is designed to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse language description, suggesting a referential order of anchor objects. Such ordered anchor objects allow DOrA to update visual features and locate the target object during the grounding process. Experimental results on the NR3D and ScanRefer datasets demonstrate our superiority in both low-resource and full-data scenarios. In particular, DOrA surpasses current state-of-the-art frameworks by 9.3% and 7.8% grounding accuracy under 1% data and 10% data settings, respectively.

- **Summary**: Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their ability to perceive objects in still images, but their application in video-related tasks, such as object tracking, remains understudied. This lack of exploration is primarily due to two key challenges. Firstly, extensive pretraining on large-scale video datasets is required to equip MLLMs with the capability to perceive objects across multiple frames and understand inter-frame relationships. Secondly, processing a large number of frames within the context window of Large Language Models (LLMs) can impose a significant computational burden. To address the first challenge, we introduce ElysiumTrack-1M, a large-scale video dataset paired with novel tasks: Referring Single Object Tracking (RSOT) and Video Referring Expression Generation (Video-REG). ElysiumTrack-1M contains 1.27 million annotated video frames with corresponding object boxes and descriptions. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct training of MLLMs and propose a token-compression model T-Selector to tackle the second challenge. Our proposed approach, Elysium: Exploring Object-level Perception in Videos via MLLM, is an end-to-end trainable MLLM that makes the first attempt to conduct object-level tasks in videos without requiring any additional plug-in or expert models.

- **Summary**: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) strategies play a crucial part in increasing the understanding and trustworthiness of neural networks. Nonetheless, these techniques could potentially generate misleading explanations. Blinding attacks can drastically alter a machine learning algorithm's prediction and explanation, providing misleading information by adding visually unnoticeable artifacts into the input, while maintaining the model's accuracy. It poses a serious challenge in ensuring the reliability of XAI methods. To ensure the reliability of XAI methods poses a real challenge, we leverage statistical analysis to highlight the changes in CNN weights within a CNN following blinding attacks. We introduce a method specifically designed to limit the effectiveness of such attacks during the evaluation phase, avoiding the need for extra training. The method we suggest defences against most modern explanation-aware adversarial attacks, achieving an approximate decrease of ~99\% in the Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a ~91\% reduction in the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the original explanation and the defended (post-attack) explanation across three unique types of attacks.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation models adapting to new tasks in a training-free manner through in-context learning is an exciting advancement. Universal segmentation models aim to generalize across the diverse modality of medical images, yet their effectiveness often diminishes when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) data modalities and tasks, requiring intricate fine-tuning of model for optimal performance. For addressing this challenge, we introduce SegICL, a novel approach leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) for image segmentation. Unlike existing methods, SegICL has the capability to employ text-guided segmentation and conduct in-context learning with a small set of image-mask pairs, eliminating the need for training the model from scratch or fine-tuning for OOD tasks (including OOD modality and dataset). Extensive experimental validation of SegICL demonstrates a positive correlation between the number of prompt samples and segmentation performance on OOD modalities and tasks. This indicates that SegICL effectively address new segmentation tasks based on contextual information. Additionally, SegICL also exhibits comparable segmentation performance to mainstream models on OOD and in-distribution tasks. Our code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Crop classification is of critical importance due to its role in studying crop pattern changes, resource management, and carbon sequestration. When employing data-driven techniques for its prediction, utilizing various temporal data sources is necessary. Deep learning models have proven to be effective for this task by mapping time series data to high-level representation for prediction. However, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple input patterns. The literature offers limited guidance for Multi-View Learning (MVL) scenarios, as it has primarily focused on exploring fusion strategies with specific encoders and validating them in local regions. In contrast, we investigate the impact of simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and the encoder architecture evaluated on a global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoder architectures (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible MVL model configurations. The validation is on the CropHarvest dataset that provides optical, radar, and weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all the cases. Instead, a specialized combination, including encoder and fusion strategy, should be meticulously sought. To streamline this search process, we suggest initially identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy, and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a technical framework for researchers exploring crop classification or related tasks through a MVL approach.

- **Summary**: Deploying deep learning (DL) models in medical applications relies on predictive performance and other critical factors, such as conveying trustworthy predictive uncertainty. Uncertainty estimation (UE) methods provide potential solutions for evaluating prediction reliability and improving the model confidence calibration. Despite increasing interest in UE, challenges persist, such as the need for explicit methods to capture aleatoric uncertainty and align uncertainty estimates with real-life disagreements among domain experts. This paper proposes an Expert Disagreement-Guided Uncertainty Estimation (EDUE) for medical image segmentation. By leveraging variability in ground-truth annotations from multiple raters, we guide the model during training and incorporate random sampling-based strategies to enhance calibration confidence. Our method achieves 55% and 23% improvement in correlation on average with expert disagreements at the image and pixel levels, respectively, better calibration, and competitive segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art deep ensembles, requiring only a single forward pass.

- **Summary**: In recent years, semantic segmentation has become a pivotal tool in processing and interpreting satellite imagery. Yet, a prevalent limitation of supervised learning techniques remains the need for extensive manual annotations by experts. In this work, we explore the potential of generative image diffusion to address the scarcity of annotated data in earth observation tasks. The main idea is to learn the joint data manifold of images and labels, leveraging recent advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate both images and corresponding masks for satellite segmentation. We find that the obtained pairs not only display high quality in fine-scale features but also ensure a wide sampling diversity. Both aspects are crucial for earth observation data, where semantic classes can vary severely in scale and occurrence frequency. We employ the novel data instances for downstream segmentation, as a form of data augmentation. In our experiments, we provide comparisons to prior works based on discriminative diffusion models or GANs. We demonstrate that integrating generated samples yields significant quantitative improvements for satellite semantic segmentation -- both compared to baselines and when training only on the original data.

This work introduces Style Filter, a tailored methodology for industrial contexts. By selectively filtering source domain data before knowledge transfer, Style Filter reduces the quantity of data while maintaining or even enhancing the performance of transfer learning strategy. Offering label-free operation, minimal reliance on prior knowledge, independence from specific models, and re-utilization, Style Filter is evaluated on authentic industrial datasets, highlighting its effectiveness when employed before conventional transfer strategies in the deep learning domain. The results underscore the effectiveness of Style Filter in real-world industrial applications.

- **Summary**: Seasonal forecasting is a crucial task when it comes to detecting the extreme heat and colds that occur due to climate change. Confidence in the predictions should be reliable since a small increase in the temperatures in a year has a big impact on the world. Calibration of the neural networks provides a way to ensure our confidence in the predictions. However, calibrating regression models is an under-researched topic, especially in forecasters. We calibrate a UNet++ based architecture, which was shown to outperform physics-based models in temperature anomalies. We show that with a slight trade-off between prediction error and calibration error, it is possible to get more reliable and sharper forecasts. We believe that calibration should be an important part of safety-critical machine learning applications such as weather forecasters.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have positioned them at the forefront of image generation. Despite their superior performance, diffusion models are not without drawbacks; they are characterized by complex architectures and substantial computational demands, resulting in significant latency due to their iterative sampling process. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a dual approach involving model miniaturization and a reduction in sampling steps, aimed at significantly decreasing model latency. Our methodology leverages knowledge distillation to streamline the U-Net and image decoder architectures, and introduces an innovative one-step DM training technique that utilizes feature matching and score distillation. We present two models, SDXS-512 and SDXS-1024, achieving inference speeds of approximately 100 FPS (30x faster than SD v1.5) and 30 FP (60x faster than SDXL) on a single GPU, respectively. Moreover, our training approach offers promising applications in image-conditioned control, facilitating efficient image-to-image translation.

- **Summary**: The objective of the collaborative vehicle-to-everything perception task is to enhance the individual vehicle's perception capability through message communication among neighboring traffic agents. Previous methods focus on achieving optimal performance within bandwidth limitations and typically adopt BEV maps as the basic collaborative message units. However, we demonstrate that collaboration with dense representations is plagued by object feature destruction during message packing, inefficient message aggregation for long-range collaboration, and implicit structure representation communication. To tackle these issues, we introduce a brand new message unit, namely point cluster, designed to represent the scene sparsely with a combination of low-level structure information and high-level semantic information. The point cluster inherently preserves object information while packing messages, with weak relevance to the collaboration range, and supports explicit structure modeling. Building upon this representation, we propose a novel framework V2X-PC for collaborative perception. This framework includes a Point Cluster Packing (PCP) module to keep object feature and manage bandwidth through the manipulation of cluster point numbers. As for effective message aggregation, we propose a Point Cluster Aggregation (PCA) module to match and merge point clusters associated with the same object. To further handle time latency and pose errors encountered in real-world scenarios, we propose parameter-free solutions that can adapt to different noisy levels without finetuning. Experiments on two widely recognized collaborative perception benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method compared to the previous state-of-the-art approaches relying on BEV maps.

- **Summary**: The advancement of generation models has led to the emergence of highly realistic artificial intelligence (AI)-generated videos. Malicious users can easily create non-existent videos to spread false information. This letter proposes an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by capturing the forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, two ResNet sub-detectors are learned separately for identifying the anomalies in spatical and optical flow domains, respectively. Results of such sub-detectors are fused to further enhance the discrimination ability. A large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) is constructed as a benchmark for model training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results verify the high generalization and robustness of our AIGVDet scheme. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/AIGVDet.

- **Summary**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proved as a powerful framework for denoising applications in medical imaging. However, GAN-based denoising algorithms still suffer from limitations in capturing complex relationships within the images. In this regard, the loss function plays a crucial role in guiding the image generation process, encompassing how much a synthetic image differs from a real image. To grasp highly complex and non-linear textural relationships in the training process, this work presents a loss function that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the Gray-Level-Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Although the recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated superior performance in classification and detection tasks, we hypothesize that its information content can be valuable when integrated into GANs' training. To this end, we propose a differentiable implementation of the GLCM suited for gradient-based optimization. Our approach also introduces a self-attention layer that dynamically aggregates the multi-scale texture information extracted from the images. We validate our approach by carrying out extensive experiments in the context of low-dose CT denoising, a challenging application that aims to enhance the quality of noisy CT scans. We utilize three publicly available datasets, including one simulated and two real datasets. The results are promising as compared to other well-established loss functions, being also consistent across three different GAN architectures.

- **Summary**: Artifact-free super-resolution (SR) aims to translate low-resolution images into their high-resolution counterparts with a strict integrity of the original content, eliminating any distortions or synthetic details. While traditional diffusion-based SR techniques have demonstrated remarkable abilities to enhance image detail, they are prone to artifact introduction during iterative procedures. Such artifacts, ranging from trivial noise to unauthentic textures, deviate from the true structure of the source image, thus challenging the integrity of the super-resolution process. In this work, we propose Self-Adaptive Reality-Guided Diffusion (SARGD), a training-free method that delves into the latent space to effectively identify and mitigate the propagation of artifacts. Our SARGD begins by using an artifact detector to identify implausible pixels, creating a binary mask that highlights artifacts. Following this, the Reality Guidance Refinement (RGR) process refines artifacts by integrating this mask with realistic latent representations, improving alignment with the original image. Nonetheless, initial realistic-latent representations from lower-quality images result in over-smoothing in the final output. To address this, we introduce a Self-Adaptive Guidance (SAG) mechanism. It dynamically computes a reality score, enhancing the sharpness of the realistic latent. These alternating mechanisms collectively achieve artifact-free super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, delivering detailed artifact-free high-resolution images while reducing sampling steps by 2X. We release our code at https://github.com/ProAirVerse/Self-Adaptive-Guidance-Diffusion.git.

S2VNet distinguishes itself by swift inference speeds and reduced memory consumption compared to prevailing 3D solutions. It can also handle multi-class interactions with each of them serving to initialize different centroids. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate S2VNet surpasses task-specified solutions on both automatic/interactive setups.

- **Summary**: Visual detection of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its important application in various tasks. The existing methods for MAV detection assume that the training set and testing set have the same distribution. As a result, when deployed in new domains, the detectors would have a significant performance degradation due to domain discrepancy. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-domain MAV detection. The contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We propose a Multi-MAV-Multi-Domain (M3D) dataset consisting of both simulation and realistic images. Compared to other existing datasets, the proposed one is more comprehensive in the sense that it covers rich scenes, diverse MAV types, and various viewing angles. A new benchmark for cross-domain MAV detection is proposed based on the proposed dataset. 2) We propose a Noise Suppression Network (NSN) based on the framework of pseudo-labeling and a large-to-small training procedure. To reduce the challenging pseudo-label noises, two novel modules are designed in this network. The first is a prior-based curriculum learning module for allocating adaptive thresholds for pseudo labels with different difficulties. The second is a masked copy-paste augmentation module for pasting truly-labeled MAVs on unlabeled target images and thus decreasing pseudo-label noises. 3) Extensive experimental results verify the superior performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art ones. In particular, it achieves mAP of 46.9%(+5.8%), 50.5%(+3.7%), and 61.5%(+11.3%) on the tasks of simulation-to-real adaptation, cross-scene adaptation, and cross-camera adaptation, respectively.

- **Summary**: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks.   This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on perceptual quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.

- **Summary**: Advances in digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising opportunities for clinical decision support and enhancing diagnostic workflows. Previous studies already demonstrated AI's potential for automated Gleason grading, but lack state-of-the-art methodology and model reusability. To address this issue, we propose DeepGleason: an open-source deep neural network based image classification system for automated Gleason grading using whole-slide histopathology images from prostate tissue sections. Implemented with the standardized AUCMEDI framework, our tool employs a tile-wise classification approach utilizing fine-tuned image preprocessing techniques in combination with a ConvNeXt architecture which was compared to various state-of-the-art architectures. The neural network model was trained and validated on an in-house dataset of 34,264 annotated tiles from 369 prostate carcinoma slides. We demonstrated that DeepGleason is capable of highly accurate and reliable Gleason grading with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.806, AUC of 0.991, and Accuracy of 0.974. The internal architecture comparison revealed that the ConvNeXt model was superior performance-wise on our dataset to established and other modern architectures like transformers. Furthermore, we were able to outperform the current state-of-the-art in tile-wise fine-classification with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.94 and 0.98 for benign vs malignant detection as well as of 0.91 and 0.75 for Gleason 3 vs Gleason 4 & 5 classification, respectively. Our tool contributes to the wider adoption of AI-based Gleason grading within the research community and paves the way for broader clinical application of deep learning models in digital pathology. DeepGleason is open-source and publicly available for research application in the following Git repository: https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/DeepGleason.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn user-specific preferences (e.g., "good parking spot", "convenient drop-off location") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., "red cube"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is a dominant health concern calling for advanced diagnostic tools. Utilizing digital pathology and artificial intelligence, this study explores the potential of 11 deep neural network architectures for automated Gleason grading in prostate carcinoma focusing on comparing traditional and recent architectures. A standardized image classification pipeline, based on the AUCMEDI framework, facilitated robust evaluation using an in-house dataset consisting of 34,264 annotated tissue tiles. The results indicated varying sensitivity across architectures, with ConvNeXt demonstrating the strongest performance. Notably, newer architectures achieved superior performance, even though with challenges in differentiating closely related Gleason grades. The ConvNeXt model was capable of learning a balance between complexity and generalizability. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for enhanced Gleason grading systems, potentially improving diagnostic efficiency for prostate cancer.

- **Summary**: Source-Free Domain Generalization (SFDG) aims to develop a model that works for unseen target domains without relying on any source domain. Recent work, PromptStyler, employs text prompts to simulate different distribution shifts in the joint vision-language space, allowing the model to generalize effectively to unseen domains without using any images. However, 1) PromptStyler's style generation strategy has limitations, as all style patterns are fixed after the first training phase. This leads to the training set in the second training phase being restricted to a limited set of styles. Additionally, 2) the frozen text encoder in PromptStyler result in the encoder's output varying with the style of the input text prompts, making it difficult for the model to learn domain-invariant features. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic PromptStyler (DPStyler), comprising Style Generation and Style Removal modules to address these issues. The Style Generation module refreshes all styles at every training epoch, while the Style Removal module eliminates variations in the encoder's output features caused by input styles. Moreover, since the Style Generation module, responsible for generating style word vectors using random sampling or style mixing, makes the model sensitive to input text prompts, we introduce a model ensemble method to mitigate this sensitivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

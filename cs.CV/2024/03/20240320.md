- **Summary**: The analysis of dynamic organelles remains a formidable challenge, though key to understanding biological processes. We introduce Nellie, an automated and unbiased pipeline for segmentation, tracking, and feature extraction of diverse intracellular structures. Nellie adapts to image metadata, eliminating user input. Nellie's preprocessing pipeline enhances structural contrast on multiple intracellular scales allowing for robust hierarchical segmentation of sub-organellar regions. Internal motion capture markers are generated and tracked via a radius-adaptive pattern matching scheme, and used as guides for sub-voxel flow interpolation. Nellie extracts a plethora of features at multiple hierarchical levels for deep and customizable analysis. Nellie features a Napari-based GUI that allows for code-free operation and visualization, while its modular open-source codebase invites customization by experienced users. We demonstrate Nellie's wide variety of use cases with two examples: unmixing multiple organelles from a single channel using feature-based classification and training an unsupervised graph autoencoder on mitochondrial multi-mesh graphs to quantify latent space embedding changes following ionomycin treatment.

- **Summary**: Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) have emerged as a novel framework for enabling interpretable machine learning algorithms equipped with the ability to reason and explain their decision processes. The basic idea is to represent discrete information through high dimensional random vectors. Complex data structures can be built up with operations over vectors such as the "binding" operation involving element-wise vector multiplication, which associates data together. The reverse task of decomposing the associated elements is a combinatorially hard task, with an exponentially large search space. The main algorithm for performing this search is the resonator network, inspired by Hopfield network-based memory search operations.   In this work, we introduce a new variant of the resonator network, based on self-attention based update rules in the iterative search problem. This update rule, based on the Hopfield network with log-sum-exp energy function and norm-bounded states, is shown to substantially improve the performance and rate of convergence. As a result, our algorithm enables a larger capacity for associative memory, enabling applications in many tasks like perception based pattern recognition, scene decomposition, and object reasoning. We substantiate our algorithm with a thorough evaluation and comparisons to baselines.

- **Summary**: Directly learning to model 4D content, including shape, color and motion, is challenging. Existing methods depend on skeleton-based motion control and offer limited continuity in detail. To address this, we propose a novel framework that generates coherent 4D sequences with animation of 3D shapes under given conditions with dynamic evolution of shape and color over time through integrative latent mapping. We first employ an integrative latent unified representation to encode shape and color information of each detailed 3D geometry frame. The proposed skeleton-free latent 4D sequence joint representation allows us to leverage diffusion models in a low-dimensional space to control the generation of 4D sequences. Finally, temporally coherent 4D sequences are generated conforming well to the input images and text prompts. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, 3DBiCar and DeformingThings4D datasets for several tasks demonstrate that our method effectively learns to generate quality 3D shapes with color and 4D mesh animations, improving over the current state-of-the-art. Source code will be released.

- **Summary**: Sora is the first large-scale generalist video generation model that garnered significant attention across society. Since its launch by OpenAI in February 2024, no other video generation models have paralleled {Sora}'s performance or its capacity to support a broad spectrum of video generation tasks. Additionally, there are only a few fully published video generation models, with the majority being closed-source. To address this gap, this paper proposes a new multi-agent framework Mora, which incorporates several advanced visual AI agents to replicate generalist video generation demonstrated by Sora. In particular, Mora can utilize multiple visual agents and successfully mimic Sora's video generation capabilities in various tasks, such as (1) text-to-video generation, (2) text-conditional image-to-video generation, (3) extend generated videos, (4) video-to-video editing, (5) connect videos and (6) simulate digital worlds. Our extensive experimental results show that Mora achieves performance that is proximate to that of Sora in various tasks. However, there exists an obvious performance gap between our work and Sora when assessed holistically. In summary, we hope this project can guide the future trajectory of video generation through collaborative AI agents.

- **Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) focuses on learning from dynamic and changing data distributions while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Various methods have been developed to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, including regularization-based, Bayesian-based, and memory-replay-based techniques. However, these methods lack a unified framework and common terminology for describing their approaches. This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing a comprehensive and overarching framework that encompasses and reconciles these existing methodologies. Notably, this new framework is capable of encompassing established CL approaches as special instances within a unified and general optimization objective. An intriguing finding is that despite their diverse origins, these methods share common mathematical structures. This observation highlights the compatibility of these seemingly distinct techniques, revealing their interconnectedness through a shared underlying optimization objective. Moreover, the proposed general framework introduces an innovative concept called refresh learning, specifically designed to enhance the CL performance. This novel approach draws inspiration from neuroscience, where the human brain often sheds outdated information to improve the retention of crucial knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new information. In essence, refresh learning operates by initially unlearning current data and subsequently relearning it. It serves as a versatile plug-in that seamlessly integrates with existing CL methods, offering an adaptable and effective enhancement to the learning process. Extensive experiments on CL benchmarks and theoretical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed refresh learning.

- **Summary**: Segment anything model (SAM), a foundation model with superior versatility and generalization across diverse segmentation tasks, has attracted widespread attention in medical imaging. However, it has been proved that SAM would encounter severe performance degradation due to the lack of medical knowledge in training and local feature encoding. Though several SAM-based models have been proposed for tuning SAM in medical imaging, they still suffer from insufficient feature extraction and highly rely on high-quality prompts. In this paper, we construct a large CT dataset consisting of 1.1M CT images and 5M masks from public datasets and propose a powerful foundation model SAMCT allowing labor-free prompts. Specifically, based on SAM, SAMCT is further equipped with a U-shaped CNN image encoder, a cross-branch interaction module, and a task-indicator prompt encoder. The U-shaped CNN image encoder works in parallel with the ViT image encoder in SAM to supplement local features. Cross-branch interaction enhances the feature expression capability of the CNN image encoder and the ViT image encoder by exchanging global perception and local features from one to the other. The task-indicator prompt encoder is a plug-and-play component to effortlessly encode task-related indicators into prompt embeddings. In this way, SAMCT can work in an automatic manner in addition to the semi-automatic interactive strategy in SAM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SAMCT against the state-of-the-art task-specific and SAM-based medical foundation models on various tasks. The code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/xianlin7/SAMCT.



### Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Spatial and Temporal Consistency Regularizations

- **Summary**: The perception of motion behavior in a dynamic environment holds significant importance for autonomous driving systems, wherein class-agnostic motion prediction methods directly predict the motion of the entire point cloud. While most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning, the manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, several annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge. Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses, which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Recent trends in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) research have been increasingly focusing on advancing beyond general image understanding towards more nuanced, object-level referential comprehension. In this paper, we present and delve into the self-consistency capability of LVLMs, a crucial aspect that reflects the models' ability to both generate informative captions for specific objects and subsequently utilize these captions to accurately re-identify the objects in a closed-loop process. This capability significantly mirrors the precision and reliability of fine-grained visual-language understanding. Our findings reveal that the self-consistency level of existing LVLMs falls short of expectations, posing limitations on their practical applicability and potential. To address this gap, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm named Self-Consistency Tuning (SC-Tune). It features the synergistic learning of a cyclic describer-locator system. This paradigm is not only data-efficient but also exhibits generalizability across multiple LVLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SC-Tune significantly elevates performance across a spectrum of object-level vision-language benchmarks and maintains competitive or improved performance on image-level vision-language benchmarks. Both our model and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/ivattyue/SC-Tune.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Recently, prompt-based methods have emerged as a new alternative `parameter-efficient fine-tuning' paradigm, which only fine-tunes a small number of additional parameters while keeping the original model frozen. However, despite achieving notable results, existing prompt methods mainly focus on `what to add', while overlooking the equally important aspect of `where to add', typically relying on the manually crafted placement. To this end, we propose a region-based Adaptive Visual Prompt, named AdaViPro, which integrates the `where to add' optimization of the prompt into the learning process. Specifically, we reconceptualize the `where to add' optimization as a problem of regional decision-making. During inference, AdaViPro generates a regionalized mask map for the whole image, which is composed of 0 and 1, to designate whether to apply or discard the prompt in each specific area. Therefore, we employ Gumbel-Softmax sampling to enable AdaViPro's end-to-end learning through standard back-propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaViPro yields new efficiency and accuracy trade-offs for adapting pre-trained models.

- **Summary**: Recent years have seen an explosion of work and interest in text-to-3D shape generation. Much of the progress is driven by advances in 3D representations, large-scale pretraining and representation learning for text and image data enabling generative AI models, and differentiable rendering. Computational systems that can perform text-to-3D shape generation have captivated the popular imagination as they enable non-expert users to easily create 3D content directly from text. However, there are still many limitations and challenges remaining in this problem space. In this state-of-the-art report, we provide a survey of the underlying technology and methods enabling text-to-3D shape generation to summarize the background literature. We then derive a systematic categorization of recent work on text-to-3D shape generation based on the type of supervision data required. Finally, we discuss limitations of the existing categories of methods, and delineate promising directions for future work.

- **Summary**: Neural Architecture Search is a costly practice. The fact that a search space can span a vast number of design choices with each architecture evaluation taking nontrivial overhead makes it hard for an algorithm to sufficiently explore candidate networks. In this paper, we propose AutoBuild, a scheme which learns to align the latent embeddings of operations and architecture modules with the ground-truth performance of the architectures they appear in. By doing so, AutoBuild is capable of assigning interpretable importance scores to architecture modules, such as individual operation features and larger macro operation sequences such that high-performance neural networks can be constructed without any need for search. Through experiments performed on state-of-the-art image classification, segmentation, and Stable Diffusion models, we show that by mining a relatively small set of evaluated architectures, AutoBuild can learn to build high-quality architectures directly or help to reduce search space to focus on relevant areas, finding better architectures that outperform both the original labeled ones and ones found by search baselines.

- **Summary**: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) performs remarkably on language models, especially for length extrapolation of Transformers. However, the impacts of RoPE on computer vision domains have been underexplored, even though RoPE appears capable of enhancing Vision Transformer (ViT) performance in a way similar to the language domain. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of RoPE when applied to ViTs, utilizing practical implementations of RoPE for 2D vision data. The analysis reveals that RoPE demonstrates impressive extrapolation performance, i.e., maintaining precision while increasing image resolution at inference. It eventually leads to performance improvement for ImageNet-1k, COCO detection, and ADE-20k segmentation. We believe this study provides thorough guidelines to apply RoPE into ViT, promising improved backbone performance with minimal extra computational overhead.

- **Summary**: Current perceptive models heavily depend on resource-intensive datasets, prompting the need for innovative solutions. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion models, synthetic data, by constructing image inputs from various annotations, proves beneficial for downstream tasks. While prior methods have separately addressed generative and perceptive models, DetDiffusion, for the first time, harmonizes both, tackling the challenges in generating effective data for perceptive models. To enhance image generation with perceptive models, we introduce perception-aware loss (P.A. loss) through segmentation, improving both quality and controllability. To boost the performance of specific perceptive models, our method customizes data augmentation by extracting and utilizing perception-aware attribute (P.A. Attr) during generation. Experimental results from the object detection task highlight DetDiffusion's superior performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in layout-guided generation. Furthermore, image syntheses from DetDiffusion can effectively augment training data, significantly enhancing downstream detection performance.

- **Summary**: Language-guided scene-aware human motion generation has great significance for entertainment and robotics. In response to the limitations of existing datasets, we introduce LaserHuman, a pioneering dataset engineered to revolutionize Scene-Text-to-Motion research. LaserHuman stands out with its inclusion of genuine human motions within 3D environments, unbounded free-form natural language descriptions, a blend of indoor and outdoor scenarios, and dynamic, ever-changing scenes. Diverse modalities of capture data and rich annotations present great opportunities for the research of conditional motion generation, and can also facilitate the development of real-life applications. Moreover, to generate semantically consistent and physically plausible human motions, we propose a multi-conditional diffusion model, which is simple but effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.

- **Summary**: Large multimodal models extend the impressive capabilities of large language models by integrating multimodal understanding abilities. However, it is not clear how they can emulate the general intelligence and reasoning ability of humans. As recognizing patterns and abstracting concepts are key to general intelligence, we introduce PuzzleVQA, a collection of puzzles based on abstract patterns. With this dataset, we evaluate large multimodal models with abstract patterns based on fundamental concepts, including colors, numbers, sizes, and shapes. Through our experiments on state-of-the-art large multimodal models, we find that they are not able to generalize well to simple abstract patterns. Notably, even GPT-4V cannot solve more than half of the puzzles. To diagnose the reasoning challenges in large multimodal models, we progressively guide the models with our ground truth reasoning explanations for visual perception, inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning. Our systematic analysis finds that the main bottlenecks of GPT-4V are weaker visual perception and inductive reasoning abilities. Through this work, we hope to shed light on the limitations of large multimodal models and how they can better emulate human cognitive processes in the future (Our data and code will be released publicly at https://github.com/declare-lab/LLM-PuzzleTest).

- **Summary**: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data obtained by the patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. The integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of a patient's condition and can enhance diagnoses and treatment decisions. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently showcase outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit.   We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and the generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex, and multiclass Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI-tabular data fusion methods. The code, enclosed to this manuscript will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Dataset distillation is an advanced technique aimed at compressing datasets into significantly smaller counterparts, while preserving formidable training performance. Significant efforts have been devoted to promote evaluation accuracy under limited compression ratio while overlooked the robustness of distilled dataset. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that, to the best of our knowledge, is the most extensive to date for evaluating the adversarial robustness of distilled datasets in a unified way. Our benchmark significantly expands upon prior efforts by incorporating a wider range of dataset distillation methods, including the latest advancements such as TESLA and SRe2L, a diverse array of adversarial attack methods, and evaluations across a broader and more extensive collection of datasets such as ImageNet-1K. Moreover, we assessed the robustness of these distilled datasets against representative adversarial attack algorithms like PGD and AutoAttack, while exploring their resilience from a frequency perspective. We also discovered that incorporating distilled data into the training batches of the original dataset can yield to improvement of robustness.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task to ensure the reliability and security of machine learning models deployed in real-world applications. Conventional methods for OOD detection that rely on single-modal information, often struggle to capture the rich variety of OOD instances. The primary difficulty in OOD detection arises when an input image has numerous similarities to a particular class in the in-distribution (ID) dataset, e.g., wolf to dog, causing the model to misclassify it. Nevertheless, it may be easy to distinguish these classes in the semantic domain. To this end, in this paper, a novel method called ODPC is proposed, in which specific prompts to generate OOD peer classes of ID semantics are designed by a large language model as an auxiliary modality to facilitate detection. Moreover, a contrastive loss based on OOD peer classes is devised to learn compact representations of ID classes and improve the clarity of boundaries between different classes. The extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the method we propose can yield state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: High-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis based on Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) typically require steady, high-quality photographs, often impractical to capture with handheld cameras. We present a method that adapts to camera motion and allows high-quality scene reconstruction with handheld video data suffering from motion blur and rolling shutter distortion. Our approach is based on detailed modelling of the physical image formation process and utilizes velocities estimated using visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Camera poses are considered non-static during the exposure time of a single image frame and camera poses are further optimized in the reconstruction process. We formulate a differentiable rendering pipeline that leverages screen space approximation to efficiently incorporate rolling-shutter and motion blur effects into the 3DGS framework. Our results with both synthetic and real data demonstrate superior performance in mitigating camera motion over existing methods, thereby advancing 3DGS in naturalistic settings.

- **Summary**: Scene text image super-resolution has significantly improved the accuracy of scene text recognition. However, many existing methods emphasize performance over efficiency and ignore the practical need for lightweight solutions in deployment scenarios. Faced with the issues, our work proposes an efficient framework called SGENet to facilitate deployment on resource-limited platforms. SGENet contains two branches: super-resolution branch and semantic guidance branch. We apply a lightweight pre-trained recognizer as a semantic extractor to enhance the understanding of text information. Meanwhile, we design the visual-semantic alignment module to achieve bidirectional alignment between image features and semantics, resulting in the generation of highquality prior guidance. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark dataset, and the proposed SGENet achieves excellent performance with fewer computational costs.

- **Summary**: As an essential task in autonomous driving (AD), motion prediction aims to predict the future states of surround objects for navigation. One natural solution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner where each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and previously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering works like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition. However, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps are independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single linear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They dominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training MLPs compared to autoregressive networks.   In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion forecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a unified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible. However, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units -words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized attention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and different position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding the transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while adopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the aforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably, AMP outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods: MotionLM and StateTransformer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance field has achieved fundamental success in novel view synthesis from input views with the same brightness level captured under fixed normal lighting. Unfortunately, synthesizing novel views remains to be a challenge for input views with heterogeneous brightness level captured under low-light condition. The condition is pretty common in the real world. It causes low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and camera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this problem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise from input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across heterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels across multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map individually for each view. To allow intuitive editing of the illumination, we design an illumination adjustment module to enable either brightening or darkening of the illumination component. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this approach enables effective intrinsic decomposition for low-light multi-view noisy images and achieves superior visual quality and numerical performance for synthesizing novel views compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Prediction the conversion to early-stage dementia is critical for mitigating its progression but remains challenging due to subtle cognitive impairments and structural brain changes. Traditional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI) research focus on identifying brain atrophy regions but often fails to address the intricate connectivity between them. This limitation underscores the necessity of focuing on inter-regional connectivity for a comprehensive understand of the brain's complex network. Moreover, there is a pressing demand for methods that adaptively preserve and extract critical information, particularly specialized subgraph mining techniques for brain networks. These are essential for developing high-quality feature representations that reveal critical spatial impacts of structural brain changes and its topology. In this paper, we propose Brain-SubGNN, a novel graph representation network to mine and enhance critical subgraphs based on T1-MRI. This network provides a subgraph-level interpretation, enhancing interpretability and insights for graph analysis. The process begins by extracting node features and a correlation matrix between nodes to construct a task-oriented brain network. Brain-SubGNN then adaptively identifies and enhances critical subgraphs, capturing both loop and neighbor subgraphs. This method reflects the loop topology and local changes, indicative of long-range connections, and maintains local and global brain attributes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of Brain-SubGNN, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for understanding and diagnosing early-stage dementia.

- **Summary**: The scarcity of well-annotated medical datasets requires leveraging transfer learning from broader datasets like ImageNet or pre-trained models like CLIP. Model soups averages multiple fine-tuned models aiming to improve performance on In-Domain (ID) tasks and enhance robustness against Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets. However, applying these methods to the medical imaging domain faces challenges and results in suboptimal performance. This is primarily due to differences in error surface characteristics that stem from data complexities such as heterogeneity, domain shift, class imbalance, and distributional shifts between training and testing phases. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical merging approach that involves local and global aggregation of models at various levels based on models' hyperparameter configurations. Furthermore, to alleviate the need for training a large number of models in the hyperparameter search, we introduce a computationally efficient method using a cyclical learning rate scheduler to produce multiple models for aggregation in the weight space. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over the model souping approach across multiple datasets (around 6% gain in HAM10000 and CheXpert datasets) while maintaining low computational costs for model generation and selection. Moreover, we achieve better results on OOD datasets than model soups. The code is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/FissionFusion.

- **Summary**: With the emergence of vision language models in the medical imaging domain, numerous studies have focused on two dominant research activities: (1) report generation from Chest X-rays (CXR), and (2) synthetic scan generation from text or reports. Despite some research incorporating multi-view CXRs into the generative process, prior patient scans and reports have been generally disregarded. This can inadvertently lead to the leaving out of important medical information, thus affecting generation quality. To address this, we propose TiBiX: Leveraging Temporal information for Bidirectional X-ray and Report Generation. Considering previous scans, our approach facilitates bidirectional generation, primarily addressing two challenging problems: (1) generating the current image from the previous image and current report and (2) generating the current report based on both the previous and current images. Moreover, we extract and release a curated temporal benchmark dataset derived from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, which focuses on temporal data. Our comprehensive experiments and ablation studies explore the merits of incorporating prior CXRs and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the report generation task. Furthermore, we attain on-par performance with SOTA image generation efforts, thus serving as a new baseline in longitudinal bidirectional CXR-to-report generation.

- **Summary**: Video Transformers have become the prevalent solution for various video downstream tasks with superior expressive power and flexibility. However, these video transformers suffer from heavy computational costs induced by the massive number of tokens across the entire video frames, which has been the major barrier to training the model. Further, the patches irrelevant to the main contents, e.g., backgrounds, degrade the generalization performance of models. To tackle these issues, we propose training free token merging for lightweight video Transformer (vid-TLDR) that aims to enhance the efficiency of video Transformers by merging the background tokens without additional training. For vid-TLDR, we introduce a novel approach to capture the salient regions in videos only with the attention map. Further, we introduce the saliency-aware token merging strategy by dropping the background tokens and sharpening the object scores. Our experiments show that vid-TLDR significantly mitigates the computational complexity of video Transformers while achieving competitive performance compared to the base model without vid-TLDR.

- **Summary**: Unified anomaly detection (AD) is one of the most challenges for anomaly detection, where one unified model is trained with normal samples from multiple classes with the objective to detect anomalies in these classes. For such a challenging task, popular normalizing flow (NF) based AD methods may fall into a "homogeneous mapping" issue,where the NF-based AD models are biased to generate similar latent representations for both normal and abnormal features, and thereby lead to a high missing rate of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Gaussian mixture normalizing flow modeling method for accomplishing unified Anomaly Detection, which we call HGAD. Our HGAD consists of two key components: inter-class Gaussian mixture modeling and intra-class mixed class centers learning. Compared to the previous NF-based AD methods, the hierarchical Gaussian mixture modeling approach can bring stronger representation capability to the latent space of normalizing flows, so that even complex multi-class distribution can be well represented and learned in the latent space. In this way, we can avoid mapping different class distributions into the same single Gaussian prior, thus effectively avoiding or mitigating the "homogeneous mapping" issue. We further indicate that the more distinguishable different class centers, the more conducive to avoiding the bias issue. Thus, we further propose a mutual information maximization loss for better structuring the latent feature space. We evaluate our method on four real-world AD benchmarks, where we can significantly improve the previous NF-based AD methods and also outperform the SOTA unified AD methods.

- **Summary**: Redundancy is a persistent challenge in Capsule Networks (CapsNet),leading to high computational costs and parameter counts. Although previous works have introduced pruning after the initial capsule layer, dynamic routing's fully connected nature and non-orthogonal weight matrices reintroduce redundancy in deeper layers. Besides, dynamic routing requires iterating to converge, further increasing computational demands. In this paper, we propose an Orthogonal Capsule Network (OrthCaps) to reduce redundancy, improve routing performance and decrease parameter counts. Firstly, an efficient pruned capsule layer is introduced to discard redundant capsules. Secondly, dynamic routing is replaced with orthogonal sparse attention routing, eliminating the need for iterations and fully connected structures. Lastly, weight matrices during routing are orthogonalized to sustain low capsule similarity, which is the first approach to introduce orthogonality into CapsNet as far as we know. Our experiments on baseline datasets affirm the efficiency and robustness of OrthCaps in classification tasks, in which ablation studies validate the criticality of each component. Remarkably, OrthCaps-Shallow outperforms other Capsule Network benchmarks on four datasets, utilizing only 110k parameters, which is a mere 1.25% of a standard Capsule Network's total. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves the smallest parameter count among existing Capsule Networks. Similarly, OrthCaps-Deep demonstrates competitive performance across four datasets, utilizing only 1.2% of the parameters required by its counterparts.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation. Despite their progress, challenges remain in both prompt-following ability, image quality and lack of high-quality datasets, which are essential for refining these models. As acquiring labeled data is costly, we introduce AGFSync, a framework that enhances T2I diffusion models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in a fully AI-driven approach. AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven loop. By applying AGFSync to leading T2I models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable improvements in VQA scores, aesthetic evaluations, and performance on the HPSv2 benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of refining T2I diffusion models paves the way for scalable alignment techniques.

- **Summary**: Robotic manipulation in everyday scenarios, especially in unstructured environments, requires skills in pose-aware object manipulation (POM), which adapts robots' grasping and handling according to an object's 6D pose. Recognizing an object's position and orientation is crucial for effective manipulation. For example, if a mug is lying on its side, it's more effective to grasp it by the rim rather than the handle. Despite its importance, research in POM skills remains limited, because learning manipulation skills requires pose-varying simulation environments and datasets. This paper introduces ManiPose, a pioneering benchmark designed to advance the study of pose-varying manipulation tasks. ManiPose encompasses: 1) Simulation environments for POM feature tasks ranging from 6D pose-specific pick-and-place of single objects to cluttered scenes, further including interactions with articulated objects. 2) A comprehensive dataset featuring geometrically consistent and manipulation-oriented 6D pose labels for 2936 real-world scanned rigid objects and 100 articulated objects across 59 categories. 3) A baseline for POM, leveraging the inferencing abilities of LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to analyze the relationship between 6D pose and task-specific requirements, offers enhanced pose-aware grasp prediction and motion planning capabilities. Our benchmark demonstrates notable advancements in pose estimation, pose-aware manipulation, and real-robot skill transfer, setting new standards for POM research. We will open-source the ManiPose benchmark with the final version paper, inviting the community to engage with our resources, available at our website:https://sites.google.com/view/manipose.

- **Summary**: The paper proposes a novel problem in multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) called Learning from the Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag's label. LML aims to classify instances using bag-level majority classes. This problem is valuable in various applications. Existing MIL methods are unsuitable for LML due to aggregating confidences, which may lead to inconsistency between the bag-level label and the label obtained by counting the number of instances for each class. This may lead to incorrect instance-level classification. We propose a counting network trained to produce the bag-level majority labels estimated by counting the number of instances for each class. This led to the consistency of the majority class between the network outputs and one obtained by counting the number of instances. Experimental results show that our counting network outperforms conventional MIL methods on four datasets The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/Counting-Network-for-Learning-from-Majority-Label.

- **Summary**: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) has garnered significant research attention in the field of remote sensing due to its ability to reduce the dependency on large amounts of annotated data. However, two challenges persist in this area: (1) axis-aligned proposals, which can result in misalignment for arbitrarily oriented objects, and (2) the scarcity of annotated data still limits the performance for unseen object categories. To address these issues, we propose a novel FSOD method for remote sensing images called Few-shot Oriented object detection with Memorable Contrastive learning (FOMC). Specifically, we employ oriented bounding boxes instead of traditional horizontal bounding boxes to learn a better feature representation for arbitrary-oriented aerial objects, leading to enhanced detection performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address oriented object detection in the few-shot setting for remote sensing images. To address the challenging issue of object misclassification, we introduce a supervised contrastive learning module with a dynamically updated memory bank. This module enables the use of large batches of negative samples and enhances the model's capability to learn discriminative features for unseen classes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the few-shot oriented object detection task. Code and pretrained models will be released.

- **Summary**: In biological and medical research, scientists now routinely acquire microscopy images of hundreds of morphologically heterogeneous organoids and are then faced with the task of finding patterns in the image collection, i.e., subsets of organoids that appear similar and potentially represent the same morphological class. We adopt models and algorithms for correlating organoid images, i.e., for quantifying the similarity in appearance and geometry of the organoids they depict, and for clustering organoid images by consolidating conflicting correlations. For correlating organoid images, we adopt and compare two alternatives, a partial quadratic assignment problem and a twin network. For clustering organoid images, we employ the correlation clustering problem. Empirically, we learn the parameters of these models, infer a clustering of organoid images, and quantify the accuracy of the inferred clusters, with respect to a training set and a test set we contribute of state-of-the-art light microscopy images of organoids clustered manually by biologists.

- **Summary**: Semantic image synthesis aims to generate high-quality images given semantic conditions, i.e. segmentation masks and style reference images. Existing methods widely adopt generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs take all conditional inputs and directly synthesize images in a single forward step. In this paper, semantic image synthesis is treated as an image denoising task and is handled with a novel image-to-image diffusion model (IIDM). Specifically, the style reference is first contaminated with random noise and then progressively denoised by IIDM, guided by segmentation masks. Moreover, three techniques, refinement, color-transfer and model ensembles, are proposed to further boost the generation quality. They are plug-in inference modules and do not require additional training. Extensive experiments show that our IIDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by clear margins. Further analysis is provided via detailed demonstrations. We have implemented IIDM based on the Jittor framework; code is available at https://github.com/ader47/jittor-jieke-semantic_images_synthesis.

- **Summary**: In order to improve the robustness of traditional image segmentation models to noise, this paper models the illumination term in intensity inhomogeneity images. Additionally, to enhance the model's robustness to noisy images, we incorporate the binary level set model into the proposed model. Compared to the traditional level set, the binary level set eliminates the need for continuous reinitialization. Moreover, by introducing the variational operator GL, our model demonstrates better capability in segmenting noisy images. Finally, we employ the three-step splitting operator method for solving, and the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on various images.

- **Summary**: Perceptual aliasing and weak textures pose significant challenges to the task of place recognition, hindering the performance of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. This paper presents a novel model, called UMF (standing for Unifying Local and Global Multimodal Features) that 1) leverages multi-modality by cross-attention blocks between vision and LiDAR features, and 2) includes a re-ranking stage that re-orders based on local feature matching the top-k candidates retrieved using a global representation. Our experiments, particularly on sequences captured on a planetary-analogous environment, show that UMF outperforms significantly previous baselines in those challenging aliased environments. Since our work aims to enhance the reliability of SLAM in all situations, we also explore its performance on the widely used RobotCar dataset, for broader applicability.

- **Summary**: Depth-based 3D hand pose estimation is an important but challenging research task in human-machine interaction community. Recently, dense regression methods have attracted increasing attention in 3D hand pose estimation task, which provide a low computational burden and high accuracy regression way by densely regressing hand joint offset maps. However, large-scale regression offset values are often affected by noise and outliers, leading to a significant drop in accuracy. To tackle this, we re-formulate 3D hand pose estimation as a dense ordinal regression problem and propose a novel Dense Ordinal Regression 3D Pose Network (DOR3D-Net). Specifically, we first decompose offset value regression into sub-tasks of binary classifications with ordinal constraints. Then, each binary classifier can predict the probability of a binary spatial relationship relative to joint, which is easier to train and yield much lower level of noise. The estimated hand joint positions are inferred by aggregating the ordinal regression results at local positions with a weighted sum. Furthermore, both joint regression loss and ordinal regression loss are used to train our DOR3D-Net in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets (ICVL, MSRA, NYU and HANDS2017) show that our design provides significant improvements over SOTA methods.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation. However, when leveraging this idea for video generation, we face significant challenges in maintaining the consistency and continuity across video frames. This is mainly caused by the lack of an effective framework to align frames of videos with desired temporal features while preserving consistent semantic and stochastic features. In this work, we propose a novel Sector-Shaped Diffusion Model (S2DM) whose sector-shaped diffusion region is formed by a set of ray-shaped reverse diffusion processes starting at the same noise point. S2DM can generate a group of intrinsically related data sharing the same semantic and stochastic features while varying on temporal features with appropriate guided conditions. We apply S2DM to video generation tasks, and explore the use of optical flow as temporal conditions. Our experimental results show that S2DM outperforms many existing methods in the task of video generation without any temporal-feature modelling modules. For text-to-video generation tasks where temporal conditions are not explicitly given, we propose a two-stage generation strategy which can decouple the generation of temporal features from semantic-content features. We show that, without additional training, our model integrated with another temporal conditions generative model can still achieve comparable performance with existing works. Our results can be viewd at https://s2dm.github.io/S2DM/.

- **Summary**: 3D cell tracking in a living organism has a crucial role in live cell image analysis. Cell tracking in C. elegans has two difficulties. First, cell migration in a consecutive frame is large since they move their head during scanning. Second, cell detection is often inconsistent in consecutive frames due to touching cells and low-contrast images, and these inconsistent detections affect the tracking performance worse. In this paper, we propose a cell tracking method to address these issues, which has two main contributions. First, we introduce cell position heatmap-based non-rigid alignment with test-time fine-tuning, which can warp the detected points to near the positions at the next frame. Second, we propose a pairwise detection method, which uses the information of detection results at the previous frame for detecting cells at the current frame. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of each module, and the proposed method achieved the best performance in comparison.

- **Summary**: Annotation ambiguity due to inherent data uncertainties such as blurred boundaries in medical scans and different observer expertise and preferences has become a major obstacle for training deep-learning based medical image segmentation models. To address it, the common practice is to gather multiple annotations from different experts, leading to the setting of multi-rater medical image segmentation. Existing works aim to either merge different annotations into the "groundtruth" that is often unattainable in numerous medical contexts, or generate diverse results, or produce personalized results corresponding to individual expert raters. Here, we bring up a more ambitious goal for multi-rater medical image segmentation, i.e., obtaining both diversified and personalized results. Specifically, we propose a two-stage framework named D-Persona (first Diversification and then Personalization). In Stage I, we exploit multiple given annotations to train a Probabilistic U-Net model, with a bound-constrained loss to improve the prediction diversity. In this way, a common latent space is constructed in Stage I, where different latent codes denote diversified expert opinions. Then, in Stage II, we design multiple attention-based projection heads to adaptively query the corresponding expert prompts from the shared latent space, and then perform the personalized medical image segmentation. We evaluated the proposed model on our in-house Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma dataset and the public lung nodule dataset (i.e., LIDC-IDRI). Extensive experiments demonstrated our D-Persona can provide diversified and personalized results at the same time, achieving new SOTA performance for multi-rater medical image segmentation. Our code will be released at https://github.com/ycwu1997/D-Persona.

- **Summary**: Foundation models have reshaped the landscape of Remote Sensing (RS) by enhancing various image interpretation tasks. Pretraining is an active research topic, encompassing supervised and self-supervised learning methods to initialize model weights effectively. However, transferring the pretrained models to downstream tasks may encounter task discrepancy due to their formulation of pretraining as image classification or object discrimination tasks. In this study, we explore the Multi-Task Pretraining (MTP) paradigm for RS foundation models to address this issue. Using a shared encoder and task-specific decoder architecture, we conduct multi-task supervised pretraining on the SAMRS dataset, encompassing semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and rotated object detection. MTP supports both convolutional neural networks and vision transformer foundation models with over 300 million parameters. The pretrained models are finetuned on various RS downstream tasks, such as scene classification, horizontal and rotated object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection. Extensive experiments across 14 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our models over existing ones of similar size and their competitive performance compared to larger state-of-the-art models, thus validating the effectiveness of MTP.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the challenge of accurate 6D pose estimation in Augmented Reality (AR), a critical component for seamlessly integrating virtual objects into real-world environments. Our research primarily addresses the difficulty of estimating 6D poses from uncontrolled RGB images, a common scenario in AR applications, which lacks metadata such as focal length. We propose a novel approach that strategically decomposes the estimation of z-axis translation and focal length, leveraging the neural-render and compare strategy inherent in the FocalPose architecture. This methodology not only streamlines the 6D pose estimation process but also significantly enhances the accuracy of 3D object overlaying in AR settings. Our experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement in 6D pose estimation accuracy, with promising applications in manufacturing and robotics. Here, the precise overlay of AR visualizations and the advancement of robotic vision systems stand to benefit substantially from our findings.

- **Summary**: Training defect detection algorithms for visual surface inspection systems requires a large and representative set of training data. Often there is not enough real data available which additionally cannot cover the variety of possible defects. Synthetic data generated by a synthetic visual surface inspection environment can overcome this problem. Therefore, a digital twin of the object is needed, whose micro-scale surface topography is modeled by texture synthesis models. We develop stochastic texture models for sandblasted and milled surfaces based on topography measurements of such surfaces. As the surface patterns differ significantly, we use separate modeling approaches for the two cases. Sandblasted surfaces are modeled by a combination of data-based texture synthesis methods that rely entirely on the measurements. In contrast, the model for milled surfaces is procedural and includes all process-related parameters known from the machine settings.

- **Summary**: 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) captures stable and comprehensive motion states of surrounding obstacles, essential for robotic perception. However, current 3D trackers face issues with accuracy and latency consistency. In this paper, we propose Fast-Poly, a fast and effective filter-based method for 3D MOT. Building upon our previous work Poly-MOT, Fast-Poly addresses object rotational anisotropy in 3D space, enhances local computation densification, and leverages parallelization technique, improving inference speed and precision. Fast-Poly is extensively tested on two large-scale tracking benchmarks with Python implementation. On the nuScenes dataset, Fast-Poly achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 75.8% AMOTA among all methods and can run at 34.2 FPS on a personal CPU. On the Waymo dataset, Fast-Poly exhibits competitive accuracy with 63.6% MOTA and impressive inference speed (35.5 FPS).

- **Summary**: Generating medical reports for X-ray images presents a significant challenge, particularly in unpaired scenarios where access to paired image-report data for training is unavailable. Previous works have typically learned a joint embedding space for images and reports, necessitating a specific labeling schema for both. We introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need for consistent labeling schemas, thereby enhancing data accessibility and enabling the use of incompatible datasets. This approach is based on cycle-consistent mapping functions that transform image embeddings into report embeddings, coupled with report auto-encoding for medical report generation. Our model and objectives consider intricate local details and the overarching semantic context within images and reports. This approach facilitates the learning of effective mapping functions, resulting in the generation of coherent reports. It outperforms state-of-the-art results in unpaired chest X-ray report generation, demonstrating improvements in both language and clinical metrics.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements indicate that scaling up Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) effectively enhances performance on downstream multimodal tasks. The prevailing MLLM paradigm, \emph{e.g.}, LLaVA, transforms visual features into text-like tokens using a \emph{static} vision-language mapper, thereby enabling \emph{static} LLMs to develop the capability to comprehend visual information through visual instruction tuning. Although promising, the \emph{static} tuning strategy~\footnote{The static tuning refers to the trained model with static parameters.} that shares the same parameters may constrain performance across different downstream multimodal tasks. In light of this, we introduce HyperLLaVA, which involves adaptive tuning of the projector and LLM parameters, in conjunction with a dynamic visual expert and language expert, respectively. These experts are derived from HyperNetworks, which generates adaptive parameter shifts through visual and language guidance, enabling dynamic projector and LLM modeling in two-stage training.   Our experiments demonstrate that our solution significantly surpasses LLaVA on existing MLLM benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and LLaVA-Bench. ~\footnote{Our project is available on the link https://github.com/DCDmllm/HyperLLaVA}.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and extended reality (XR) in the beauty industry. In this paper, we present an AI-assisted skin care recommendation system integrated into an XR platform. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyse an individual's skin type and recommend personalised skin care products in an immersive and interactive manner. Our methodology involves collecting data from individuals through a questionnaire and conducting skin analysis using a provided facial image in an immersive environment. This data is then used to train the CNN model, which recognises the skin type and existing issues and allows the recommendation engine to suggest personalised skin care products. We evaluate our system in terms of the accuracy of the CNN model, which achieves an average score of 93% in correctly classifying existing skin issues. Being integrated into an XR system, this approach has the potential to significantly enhance the beauty industry by providing immersive and engaging experiences to users, leading to more efficient and consistent skincare routines.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces CLIPSwarm, a new algorithm designed to automate the modeling of swarm drone formations based on natural language. The algorithm begins by enriching a provided word, to compose a text prompt that serves as input to an iterative approach to find the formation that best matches the provided word. The algorithm iteratively refines formations of robots to align with the textual description, employing different steps for "exploration" and "exploitation". Our framework is currently evaluated on simple formation targets, limited to contour shapes. A formation is visually represented through alpha-shape contours and the most representative color is automatically found for the input word. To measure the similarity between the description and the visual representation of the formation, we use CLIP [1], encoding text and images into vectors and assessing their similarity. Subsequently, the algorithm rearranges the formation to visually represent the word more effectively, within the given constraints of available drones. Control actions are then assigned to the drones, ensuring robotic behavior and collision-free movement. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy in accurately modeling robot formations from natural language descriptions. The algorithm's versatility is showcased through the execution of drone shows in photorealistic simulation with varying shapes. We refer the reader to the supplementary video for a visual reference of the results.

- **Summary**: It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7% improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will be released.

- **Summary**: Computer vision techniques play a central role in the perception stack of autonomous vehicles. Such methods are employed to perceive the vehicle surroundings given sensor data. 3D LiDAR sensors are commonly used to collect sparse 3D point clouds from the scene. However, compared to human perception, such systems struggle to deduce the unseen parts of the scene given those sparse point clouds. In this matter, the scene completion task aims at predicting the gaps in the LiDAR measurements to achieve a more complete scene representation. Given the promising results of recent diffusion models as generative models for images, we propose extending them to achieve scene completion from a single 3D LiDAR scan. Previous works used diffusion models over range images extracted from LiDAR data, directly applying image-based diffusion methods. Distinctly, we propose to directly operate on the points, reformulating the noising and denoising diffusion process such that it can efficiently work at scene scale. Together with our approach, we propose a regularization loss to stabilize the noise predicted during the denoising process. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can complete the scene given a single LiDAR scan as input, producing a scene with more details compared to state-of-the-art scene completion methods. We believe that our proposed diffusion process formulation can support further research in diffusion models applied to scene-scale point cloud data.

- **Summary**: Deepfake detectors are typically trained on large sets of pristine and generated images, resulting in limited generalization capacity; they excel at identifying deepfakes created through methods encountered during training but struggle with those generated by unknown techniques. This paper introduces a learning approach aimed at significantly enhancing the generalization capabilities of deepfake detectors. Our method takes inspiration from the unique "fingerprints" that image generation processes consistently introduce into the frequency domain. These fingerprints manifest as structured and distinctly recognizable frequency patterns. We propose to train detectors using only pristine images injecting in part of them crafted frequency patterns, simulating the effects of various deepfake generation techniques without being specific to any. These synthetic patterns are based on generic shapes, grids, or auras. We evaluated our approach using diverse architectures across 25 different generation methods. The models trained with our approach were able to perform state-of-the-art deepfake detection, demonstrating also superior generalization capabilities in comparison with previous methods. Indeed, they are untied to any specific generation technique and can effectively identify deepfakes regardless of how they were made.

- **Summary**: Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) aims to establish interaction between different modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in learning semantic category discrimination. Despite the remarkable performance of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to the well-annotated data. However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the multimodal scenario. In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels. Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges -- enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and \emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval. First, we propose a semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend different modalities and provide precise transport cost. Second, to narrow the discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching. Both of these two components leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate effective cost function. The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.

While different approaches have been explored to interface LLMs with ``perceptual backbones'' that process, e.g., visual or audio data, they are often explored for different tasks, different datasets, and using different perceptual backbones and language models, hindering direct comparison of the interfacing mechanisms. To remedy this lack of comparability between methods, we present an extensive experimental evaluation of different interfacing mechanisms, across multiple tasks (including image, video, and audio captioning as well as visual question answering), datasets and backbones, paying special attention to low-data settings. We find improved performance using existing mechanisms over state-of-the-art results, and identify a new interfacing mechanism that yields (near) optimal results across different tasks, while obtaining a 4x reduction in training time.

- **Summary**: Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis, open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients: 1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.

- **Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of video-based large language models (LLMs), their adversarial threat remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose the first adversarial attack tailored for video-based LLMs by crafting flow-based multi-modal adversarial perturbations on a small fraction of frames within a video, dubbed FMM-Attack. Extensive experiments show that our attack can effectively induce video-based LLMs to generate incorrect answers when videos are added with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Intriguingly, our FMM-Attack can also induce garbling in the model output, prompting video-based LLMs to hallucinate. Overall, our observations inspire a further understanding of multi-modal robustness and safety-related feature alignment across different modalities, which is of great importance for various large multi-modal models.

- **Summary**: This paper outlines our submission for the 4th COV19D competition as part of the `Domain adaptation, Explainability, Fairness in AI for Medical Image Analysis' (DEF-AI-MIA) workshop at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR). The competition consists of two challenges. The first is to train a classifier to detect the presence of COVID-19 from over one thousand CT scans from the COV19-CT-DB database. The second challenge is to perform domain adaptation by taking the dataset from Challenge 1 and adding a small number of scans (some annotated and other not) for a different distribution. We preprocessed the CT scans to segment the lungs, and output volumes with the lungs individually and together. We then trained 3D ResNet and Swin Transformer models on these inputs. We annotated the unlabeled CT scans using an ensemble of these models and chose the high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. This resulted in a best cross-validation mean F1 score of 93.39\% for Challenge 1 and a mean F1 score of 92.15 for Challenge 2.

- **Summary**: Logit knowledge distillation attracts increasing attention due to its practicality in recent studies. However, it often suffers inferior performance compared to the feature knowledge distillation. In this paper, we argue that existing logit-based methods may be sub-optimal since they only leverage the global logit output that couples multiple semantic knowledge. This may transfer ambiguous knowledge to the student and mislead its learning. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method, i.e., Scale Decoupled Distillation (SDD), for logit knowledge distillation. SDD decouples the global logit output into multiple local logit outputs and establishes distillation pipelines for them. This helps the student to mine and inherit fine-grained and unambiguous logit knowledge. Moreover, the decoupled knowledge can be further divided into consistent and complementary logit knowledge that transfers the semantic information and sample ambiguity, respectively. By increasing the weight of complementary parts, SDD can guide the student to focus more on ambiguous samples, improving its discrimination ability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDD for wide teacher-student pairs, especially in the fine-grained classification task.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a way of enhancing the reliability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in addressing hallucination effects, where models generate incorrect or unrelated responses. Without additional instruction tuning paradigm, we introduce Counterfactual Inception, a novel method that implants counterfactual thoughts into LMMs using carefully chosen, misaligned counterfactual keywords. This method is grounded in the concept of counterfactual thinking, a cognitive process where humans consider alternative realities and outcomes. By applying this human-like reasoning mechanism to LMMs, we aim to reduce hallucination effects and improve the models' trustworthiness. We also propose Dual-modality Verification Process (DVP), a rigorous framework for selecting optimal counterfactual keywords to trigger counterfactual thinking into LMMs, concurrently considering visual and linguistic context. Our extensive experiments across various LMMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, corroborate that our method significantly mitigates hallucination phenomena across different datasets.

- **Summary**: The task of text2motion is to generate motion sequences from given textual descriptions, where a model should explore the interactions between natural language instructions and human body movements. While most existing works are confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions (e.g., "A man squats."), fine-grained ones specifying movements of relevant body parts are barely explored. Models trained with coarse texts may not be able to learn mappings from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives, resulting in the failure in generating motions from unseen descriptions. In this paper, we build a large-scale language-motion dataset with fine-grained textual descriptions, FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with delicate prompts. Accordingly, we design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, which makes full use of fine-grained textual information. Our experiments show that FineMotionDiffuse trained on FineHumanML3D acquires good results in quantitative evaluation. We also find this model can better generate spatially/chronologically composite motions by learning the implicit mappings from simple descriptions to the corresponding basic motions.

- **Summary**: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning without available historical data. Compared with its counterpart (replay-based CIL) that stores historical samples, the EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues under the exemplar-free constraint. In this paper, inspired by the recently developed analytic learning (AL) based CIL, we propose a representation enhanced analytic learning (REAL) for EFCIL. The REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining (DS-BPT) and a representation enhancing distillation (RED) process to enhance the representation of the extractor. The DS-BPT pretrains model in streams of both supervised learning and self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) for base knowledge extraction. The RED process distills the supervised knowledge to the SSCL pretrained backbone and facilitates a subsequent AL-basd CIL that converts the CIL to a recursive least-square problem. Our method addresses the issue of insufficient discriminability in representations of unseen data caused by a frozen backbone in the existing AL-based CIL. Empirical results on various datasets including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k, demonstrate that our REAL outperforms the state-of-the-arts in EFCIL, and achieves comparable or even more superior performance compared with the replay-based methods.

- **Summary**: 3D generation has witnessed significant advancements, yet efficiently producing high-quality 3D assets from a single image remains challenging. In this paper, we present a triplane autoencoder, which encodes 3D models into a compact triplane latent space to effectively compress both the 3D geometry and texture information. Within the autoencoder framework, we introduce a 3D-aware cross-attention mechanism, which utilizes low-resolution latent representations to query features from a high-resolution 3D feature volume, thereby enhancing the representation capacity of the latent space. Subsequently, we train a diffusion model on this refined latent space. In contrast to solely relying on image embedding for 3D generation, our proposed method advocates for the simultaneous utilization of both image embedding and shape embedding as conditions. Specifically, the shape embedding is estimated via a diffusion prior model conditioned on the image embedding. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving superior performance while requiring less training data and time. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality 3D assets in merely 7 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

- **Summary**: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for the generation of personalized portraits has emerged as a powerful and noteworthy tool, enabling users to create high-fidelity, custom character avatars based on their specific prompts. However, existing personalization methods face challenges, including test-time fine-tuning, the requirement of multiple input images, low preservation of identity, and limited diversity in generated outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce IDAdapter, a tuning-free approach that enhances the diversity and identity preservation in personalized image generation from a single face image. IDAdapter integrates a personalized concept into the generation process through a combination of textual and visual injections and a face identity loss. During the training phase, we incorporate mixed features from multiple reference images of a specific identity to enrich identity-related content details, guiding the model to generate images with more diverse styles, expressions, and angles compared to previous works. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving both diversity and identity fidelity in generated images.

- **Summary**: ORCA (Shen et al., 2023) is a recent technique for cross-modal fine-tuning, i.e., applying pre-trained transformer models to modalities beyond their training data. The technique consists primarily of training an embedder and fine-tuning the embedder and model. Despite its high performance on a variety of downstream tasks, we do not understand precisely how each of these components contribute to ORCA's success. Therefore, we run a series of ablations and find that embedder training does not help 2D tasks at all, contrary to what the original paper posits. In 1D tasks, some amount of embedder training is necessary but more is not better. In 4 out of 6 datasets we experiment with, it is model fine-tuning that makes the biggest difference. Through our ablations and baselines, we contribute a better understanding of the individual components of ORCA.

- **Summary**: In this paper we present a deep learning pipeline for next day fire prediction. The next day fire prediction task consists in learning models that receive as input the available information for an area up until a certain day, in order to predict the occurrence of fire for the next day. Starting from our previous problem formulation as a binary classification task on instances (daily snapshots of each area) represented by tabular feature vectors, we reformulate the problem as a semantic segmentation task on images; there, each pixel corresponds to a daily snapshot of an area, while its channels represent the formerly tabular training features. We demonstrate that this problem formulation, built within a thorough pipeline achieves state of the art results.

- **Summary**: StyleGAN has shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge for practical applications. Although recent efforts have been made to compress StyleGAN while preserving its performance, existing compressed models still lag behind the original model, particularly in terms of sample diversity. To overcome this, we propose a novel channel pruning method that leverages varying sensitivities of channels to latent vectors, which is a key factor in sample diversity. Specifically, by assessing channel importance based on their sensitivities to latent vector perturbations, our method enhances the diversity of samples in the compressed model. Since our method solely focuses on the channel pruning stage, it has complementary benefits with prior training schemes without additional training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances sample diversity across various datasets. Moreover, in terms of FID scores, our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art by a large margin but also achieves comparable scores with only half training iterations.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models facilitating various image editing techniques, complex text prompts often lead to an oversight of some requests due to a bottleneck in processing text information. To tackle this challenge, we present Ground-A-Score, a simple yet powerful model-agnostic image editing method by incorporating grounding during score distillation. This approach ensures a precise reflection of intricate prompt requirements in the editing outcomes, taking into account the prior knowledge of the object locations within the image. Moreover, the selective application with a new penalty coefficient and contrastive loss helps to precisely target editing areas while preserving the integrity of the objects in the source image. Both qualitative assessments and quantitative analyses confirm that Ground-A-Score successfully adheres to the intricate details of extended and multifaceted prompts, ensuring high-quality outcomes that respect the original image attributes.

- **Summary**: In this work, we tackle the limitations of current LiDAR-based 3D object detection systems, which are hindered by a restricted class vocabulary and the high costs associated with annotating new object classes. Our exploration of open-vocabulary (OV) learning in urban environments aims to capture novel instances using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with multi-sensor data. We design and benchmark a set of four potential solutions as baselines, categorizing them into either top-down or bottom-up approaches based on their input data strategies. While effective, these methods exhibit certain limitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying rigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of rectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal \textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the recall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more distant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a greedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and depth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified boxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias towards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator, which randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training process, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV settings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold increase in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes. The source code is made available in the supplementary material.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel learning approach for feed-forward one-shot 4D head avatar synthesis. Different from existing methods that often learn from reconstructing monocular videos guided by 3DMM, we employ pseudo multi-view videos to learn a 4D head synthesizer in a data-driven manner, avoiding reliance on inaccurate 3DMM reconstruction that could be detrimental to the synthesis performance. The key idea is to first learn a 3D head synthesizer using synthetic multi-view images to convert monocular real videos into multi-view ones, and then utilize the pseudo multi-view videos to learn a 4D head synthesizer via cross-view self-reenactment. By leveraging a simple vision transformer backbone with motion-aware cross-attentions, our method exhibits superior performance compared to previous methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, geometry consistency, and motion control accuracy. We hope our method offers novel insights into integrating 3D priors with 2D supervisions for improved 4D head avatar creation.

- **Summary**: When an image generation process is guided by both a text prompt and spatial cues, such as a set of bounding boxes, do these elements work in harmony, or does one dominate the other? Our analysis of a pretrained image diffusion model that integrates gated self-attention into the U-Net reveals that spatial grounding often outweighs textual grounding due to the sequential flow from gated self-attention to cross-attention. We demonstrate that such bias can be significantly mitigated without sacrificing accuracy in either grounding by simply rewiring the network architecture, changing from sequential to parallel for gated self-attention and cross-attention. This surprisingly simple yet effective solution does not require any fine-tuning of the network but significantly reduces the trade-off between the two groundings. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements from the original GLIGEN to the rewired version in the trade-off between textual grounding and spatial grounding.

- **Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted widespread interest and have rich applications. However, the inherent attention mechanism in its Transformer structure requires quadratic complexity and results in expensive computational overhead. Therefore, in this work, we propose VL-Mamba, a multimodal large language model based on state space models, which have been shown to have great potential for long-sequence modeling with fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length. Specifically, we first replace the transformer-based backbone language model such as LLama or Vicuna with the pre-trained Mamba language model. Then, we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning and the combinations of different vision encoders and variants of pretrained Mamba language models. The extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks with competitive performance show the effectiveness of our proposed VL-Mamba and demonstrate the great potential of applying state space models for multimodal learning tasks.

- **Summary**: Group robustness strategies aim to mitigate learned biases in deep learning models that arise from spurious correlations present in their training datasets. However, most existing methods rely on the access to the label distribution of the groups, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. As a result, unsupervised group robustness strategies are sought. Based on the insight that a trained model's classification strategies can be inferred accurately based on explainability heatmaps, we introduce ExMap, an unsupervised two stage mechanism designed to enhance group robustness in traditional classifiers. ExMap utilizes a clustering module to infer pseudo-labels based on a model's explainability heatmaps, which are then used during training in lieu of actual labels. Our empirical studies validate the efficacy of ExMap - We demonstrate that it bridges the performance gap with its supervised counterparts and outperforms existing partially supervised and unsupervised methods. Additionally, ExMap can be seamlessly integrated with existing group robustness learning strategies. Finally, we demonstrate its potential in tackling the emerging issue of multiple shortcut mitigation\footnote{Code available at \url{https://github.com/rwchakra/exmap}}.

- **Summary**: In the field of medical image segmentation, variant models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformers (ViTs) as the base modules have been very widely developed and applied. However, CNNs are often limited in their ability to deal with long sequences of information, while the low sensitivity of ViTs to local feature information and the problem of secondary computational complexity limit their development. Recently, the emergence of state-space models (SSMs), especially 2D-selective-scan (SS2D), has had an impact on the longtime dominance of traditional CNNs and ViTs as the foundational modules of visual neural networks. In this paper, we extend the adaptability of SS2D by proposing a High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) for medical image segmentation. Among them, the proposed High-order 2D-selective-scan (H-SS2D) progressively reduces the introduction of redundant information during SS2D operations through higher-order interactions. In addition, the proposed Local-SS2D module improves the learning ability of local features of SS2D at each order of interaction. We conducted comparison and ablation experiments on three publicly available medical image datasets (ISIC2017, Spleen, and CVC-ClinicDB), and the results all demonstrate the strong competitiveness of H-vmunet in medical image segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Category-agnostic pose estimation (CAPE) aims to predict keypoints for arbitrary classes given a few support images annotated with keypoints. Existing methods only rely on the features extracted at support keypoints to predict or refine the keypoints on query image, but a few support feature vectors are local and inadequate for CAPE. Considering that human can quickly perceive potential keypoints of arbitrary objects, we propose a novel framework for CAPE based on such potential keypoints (named as meta-points). Specifically, we maintain learnable embeddings to capture inherent information of various keypoints, which interact with image feature maps to produce meta-points without any support. The produced meta-points could serve as meaningful potential keypoints for CAPE. Due to the inevitable gap between inherency and annotation, we finally utilize the identities and details offered by support keypoints to assign and refine meta-points to desired keypoints in query image. In addition, we propose a progressive deformable point decoder and a slacked regression loss for better prediction and supervision. Our novel framework not only reveals the inherency of keypoints but also outperforms existing methods of CAPE. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models achieve high accuracy in segmentation tasks among others, yet domain shift often degrades the models' performance, which can be critical in real-world scenarios where no target images are available. This paper proposes a zero-shot domain adaptation method based on diffusion models, called ZoDi, which is two-fold by the design: zero-shot image transfer and model adaptation. First, we utilize an off-the-shelf diffusion model to synthesize target-like images by transferring the domain of source images to the target domain. In this we specifically try to maintain the layout and content by utilising layout-to-image diffusion models with stochastic inversion. Secondly, we train the model using both source images and synthesized images with the original segmentation maps while maximizing the feature similarity of images from the two domains to learn domain-robust representations. Through experiments we show benefits of ZoDi in the task of image segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. It is also more applicable than existing CLIP-based methods because it assumes no specific backbone or models, and it enables to estimate the model's performance without target images by inspecting generated images. Our implementation will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Reusable embeddings of user behaviour have shown significant performance improvements for the personalised saliency prediction task. However, prior works require explicit user characteristics and preferences as input, which are often difficult to obtain. We present a novel method to extract user embeddings from pairs of natural images and corresponding saliency maps generated from a small amount of user-specific eye tracking data. At the core of our method is a Siamese convolutional neural encoder that learns the user embeddings by contrasting the image and personal saliency map pairs of different users. Evaluations on two public saliency datasets show that the generated embeddings have high discriminative power, are effective at refining universal saliency maps to the individual users, and generalise well across users and images. Finally, based on our model's ability to encode individual user characteristics, our work points towards other applications that can benefit from reusable embeddings of gaze behaviour.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in non-invasive detection of cardiac hemodynamic instability (CHDI) primarily focus on applying machine learning techniques to a single data modality, e.g. cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite their potential, these approaches often fall short especially when the size of labeled patient data is limited, a common challenge in the medical domain. Furthermore, only a few studies have explored multimodal methods to study CHDI, which mostly rely on costly modalities such as cardiac MRI and echocardiogram. In response to these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal variational autoencoder ($\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$) to integrate low-cost chest X-ray (CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) modalities with pre-training on a large unlabeled dataset. Specifically, $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ introduces a novel tri-stream pre-training strategy to learn both shared and modality-specific features, thus enabling fine-tuning with both unimodal and multimodal datasets. We pre-train $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ on a large, unlabeled dataset of $50,982$ subjects from a subset of MIMIC database and then fine-tune the pre-trained model on a labeled dataset of $795$ subjects from the ASPIRE registry. Comprehensive evaluations against existing methods show that $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ offers promising performance (AUROC $=0.79$ and Accuracy $=0.77$), representing a significant step forward in non-invasive prediction of CHDI. Our model also excels in producing fine interpretations of predictions directly associated with clinical features, thereby supporting clinical decision-making.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal emotion recognition has recently gained a lot of attention since it can leverage diverse and complementary relationships over multiple modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. Most state-of-the-art methods for multimodal fusion rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the complementary nature of the modalities. In this paper, we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial, vocal, and text modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a recursive cross-modal attention (RCMA) to effectively capture the complementary relationships across the modalities in a recursive fashion. The proposed model is able to effectively capture the inter-modal relationships by computing the cross-attention weights across the individual modalities and the joint representation of the other two modalities. To further improve the inter-modal relationships, the obtained attended features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the cross-modal attention to refine the feature representations of the individual modalities. In addition to that, we have used Temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture the temporal modeling (intra-modal relationships) of the individual modalities. By deploying the TCNs as well cross-modal attention in a recursive fashion, we are able to effectively capture both intra- and inter-modal relationships across the audio, visual, and text modalities. Experimental results on validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed fusion model is able to achieve significant improvement over the baseline for the sixth challenge of Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild 2024 (ABAW6) competition.

- **Summary**: Detecting polyps through colonoscopy is an important task in medical image segmentation, which provides significant assistance and reference value for clinical surgery. However, accurate segmentation of polyps is a challenging task due to two main reasons. Firstly, polyps exhibit various shapes and colors. Secondly, the boundaries between polyps and their normal surroundings are often unclear. Additionally, significant differences between different datasets lead to limited generalization capabilities of existing methods. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation model based on Prompt-Mamba, which incorporates the latest Vision-Mamba and prompt technologies. Compared to previous models trained on the same dataset, our model not only maintains high segmentation accuracy on the validation part of the same dataset but also demonstrates superior accuracy on unseen datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization capabilities. Notably, we are the first to apply the Vision-Mamba architecture to polyp segmentation and the first to utilize prompt technology in a polyp segmentation model. Our model efficiently accomplishes segmentation tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by an average of 5% across six datasets. Furthermore, we have developed multiple versions of our model with scaled parameter counts, achieving better performance than previous models even with fewer parameters. Our code and trained weights will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Pixel2Mesh (P2M) is a classical approach for reconstructing 3D shapes from a single color image through coarse-to-fine mesh deformation. Although P2M is capable of generating plausible global shapes, its Graph Convolution Network (GCN) often produces overly smooth results, causing the loss of fine-grained geometry details. Moreover, P2M generates non-credible features for occluded regions and struggles with the domain gap from synthetic data to real-world images, which is a common challenge for single-view 3D reconstruction methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-boosted architecture, named T-Pixel2Mesh, inspired by the coarse-to-fine approach of P2M. Specifically, we use a global Transformer to control the holistic shape and a local Transformer to progressively refine the local geometry details with graph-based point upsampling. To enhance real-world reconstruction, we present the simple yet effective Linear Scale Search (LSS), which serves as prompt tuning during the input preprocessing. Our experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while results on real-world data show the generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Choreographers determine what the dances look like, while cameramen determine the final presentation of dances. Recently, various methods and datasets have showcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However, camera movement synthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to the scarcity of paired data. Thus, we present DCM, a new multi-modal 3D dataset, which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion and music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of paired dance-camera-music data from the anime community, covering 4 music genres. With this dataset, we uncover that dance camera movement is multifaceted and human-centric, and possesses multiple influencing factors, making dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or dance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties, we propose DanceCamera3D, a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel body attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation, we devise new metrics measuring camera movement quality, diversity, and dancer fidelity. Utilizing these metrics, we conduct extensive experiments on our DCM dataset, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence showcasing the effectiveness of our DanceCamera3D model.

- **Summary**: Humans see low and high spatial frequency components at the same time, and combine the information from both to form a visual scene. Drawing on this neuroscientific inspiration, we propose an altered Vision Transformer architecture where patches from scaled down versions of the input image are added to the input of the first Transformer Encoder layer. We name this model Retina Vision Transformer (RetinaViT) due to its inspiration from the human visual system. Our experiments show that when trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset with a moderate configuration, RetinaViT achieves a 3.3% performance improvement over the original ViT. We hypothesize that this improvement can be attributed to the inclusion of low spatial frequency components in the input, which improves the ability to capture structural features, and to select and forward important features to deeper layers. RetinaViT thereby opens doors to further investigations into vertical pathways and attention patterns.

- **Summary**: Leveraging the synergy of both audio data and visual data is essential for understanding human emotions and behaviors, especially in in-the-wild setting. Traditional methods for integrating such multimodal information often stumble, leading to less-than-ideal outcomes in the task of facial action unit detection. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel approach utilizing audio-visual multimodal data. This method enhances audio feature extraction by leveraging Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Log-Mel spectrogram features alongside a pre-trained VGGish network. Moreover, this paper adaptively captures fusion features across modalities by modeling the temporal relationships, and ultilizes a pre-trained GPT-2 model for sophisticated context-aware fusion of multimodal information. Our method notably improves the accuracy of AU detection by understanding the temporal and contextual nuances of the data, showcasing significant advancements in the comprehension of intricate scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of integrating temporal dynamics and contextual interpretation, paving the way for future research endeavors.

- **Summary**: High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

- **Summary**: Determining the relative pose of an object between two images is pivotal to the success of generalizable object pose estimation. Existing approaches typically approximate the continuous pose representation with a large number of discrete pose hypotheses, which incurs a computationally expensive process of scoring each hypothesis at test time. By contrast, we present a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet) that eliminates the need for pose hypotheses and computes the relative object pose in a single pass. To this end, we map the two input RGB images, reference and query, to their respective voxelized 3D representations. We then pass the resulting voxels through a pose estimation module, where the voxels are aligned and the pose is computed in an end-to-end fashion by solving a least-squares problem. To enhance robustness, we introduce a weighted closest voxel algorithm capable of mitigating the impact of noisy voxels. We conduct extensive experiments on the CO3D, LINEMOD, and Objaverse datasets, demonstrating that our method delivers more accurate relative pose estimates for novel objects at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released at: https://github.com/sailor-z/DVMNet/.

- **Summary**: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabelled images from both `seen' and `unseen' classes by transferring knowledge from a set of labelled `seen' class images. A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/sptnet.

- **Summary**: Recent research has begun to examine the potential of automatically finding and fixing accessibility issues that manifest in software. However, while recent work makes important progress, it has generally been skewed toward identifying issues that affect users with certain disabilities, such as those with visual or hearing impairments. However, there are other groups of users with different types of disabilities that also need software tooling support to improve their experience. As such, this paper aims to automatically identify accessibility issues that affect users with motor-impairments.   To move toward this goal, this paper introduces a novel approach, called MotorEase, capable of identifying accessibility issues in mobile app UIs that impact motor-impaired users. Motor-impaired users often have limited ability to interact with touch-based devices, and instead may make use of a switch or other assistive mechanism -- hence UIs must be designed to support both limited touch gestures and the use of assistive devices. MotorEase adapts computer vision and text processing techniques to enable a semantic understanding of app UI screens, enabling the detection of violations related to four popular, previously unexplored UI design guidelines that support motor-impaired users, including: (i) visual touch target size, (ii) expanding sections, (iii) persisting elements, and (iv) adjacent icon visual distance. We evaluate MotorEase on a newly derived benchmark, called MotorCheck, that contains 555 manually annotated examples of violations to the above accessibility guidelines, across 1599 screens collected from 70 applications via a mobile app testing tool. Our experiments illustrate that MotorEase is able to identify violations with an average accuracy of ~90%, and a false positive rate of less than 9%, outperforming baseline techniques.

- **Summary**: Ship detection from satellite imagery using Deep Learning (DL) is an indispensable solution for maritime surveillance. However, applying DL models trained on one dataset to others having differences in spatial resolution and radiometric features requires many adjustments. To overcome this issue, this paper focused on the DL models trained on datasets that consist of different optical images and a combination of radar and optical data. When dealing with a limited number of training images, the performance of DL models via this approach was satisfactory. They could improve 5-20% of average precision, depending on the optical images tested. Likewise, DL models trained on the combined optical and radar dataset could be applied to both optical and radar images. Our experiments showed that the models trained on an optical dataset could be used for radar images, while those trained on a radar dataset offered very poor scores when applied to optical images.

- **Summary**: Transmission line detection technology is crucial for automatic monitoring and ensuring the safety of electrical facilities. The YOLOv5 series is currently one of the most advanced and widely used methods for object detection. However, it faces inherent challenges, such as high computational load on devices and insufficient detection accuracy. To address these concerns, this paper presents an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 technique customized for mobile devices, specifically intended for identifying objects associated with transmission lines. The C3Ghost module is integrated into the convolutional network of YOLOv5 to reduce floating point operations per second (FLOPs) in the feature channel fusion process and improve feature expression performance. In addition, a FasterNet module is introduced to replace the c3 module in the YOLOv5 Backbone. The FasterNet module uses Partial Convolutions to process only a portion of the input channels, improving feature extraction efficiency and reducing computational overhead. To address the imbalance between simple and challenging samples in the dataset and the diversity of aspect ratios of bounding boxes, the wIoU v3 LOSS is adopted as the loss function. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, Experiments are conducted on a custom dataset of transmission line poles. The results show that the proposed model achieves a 1% increase in detection accuracy, a 13% reduction in FLOPs, and a 26% decrease in model parameters compared to the existing YOLOv5.In the ablation experiment, it was also discovered that while the Fastnet module and the CSghost module improved the precision of the original YOLOv5 baseline model, they caused a decrease in the mAP@.5-.95 metric. However, the improvement of the wIoUv3 loss function significantly mitigated the decline of the mAP@.5-.95 metric.

- **Summary**: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) has broad applications, with state-of-the-art methods leveraging deep neural networks for better robustness and applicability. However, there is a lack of research in fusing these learning-based methods with multi-sensor information, which could be indispensable to push related applications to large-scale and complex scenarios. In this paper, we tightly integrate the trainable deep dense bundle adjustment (DBA) with multi-sensor information through a factor graph. In the framework, recurrent optical flow and DBA are performed among sequential images. The Hessian information derived from DBA is fed into a generic factor graph for multi-sensor fusion, which employs a sliding window and supports probabilistic marginalization. A pipeline for visual-inertial integration is firstly developed, which provides the minimum ability of metric-scale localization and mapping. Furthermore, other sensors (e.g., global navigation satellite system) are integrated for driftless and geo-referencing functionality. Extensive tests are conducted on both public datasets and self-collected datasets. The results validate the superior localization performance of our approach, which enables real-time dense mapping in large-scale environments. The code has been made open-source (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/DBA-Fusion).

- **Summary**: Video outpainting is a challenging task, aiming at generating video content outside the viewport of the input video while maintaining inter-frame and intra-frame consistency. Existing methods fall short in either generation quality or flexibility. We introduce MOTIA Mastering Video Outpainting Through Input-Specific Adaptation, a diffusion-based pipeline that leverages both the intrinsic data-specific patterns of the source video and the image/video generative prior for effective outpainting. MOTIA comprises two main phases: input-specific adaptation and pattern-aware outpainting. The input-specific adaptation phase involves conducting efficient and effective pseudo outpainting learning on the single-shot source video. This process encourages the model to identify and learn patterns within the source video, as well as bridging the gap between standard generative processes and outpainting. The subsequent phase, pattern-aware outpainting, is dedicated to the generalization of these learned patterns to generate outpainting outcomes. Additional strategies including spatial-aware insertion and noise travel are proposed to better leverage the diffusion model's generative prior and the acquired video patterns from source videos. Extensive evaluations underscore MOTIA's superiority, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in widely recognized benchmarks. Notably, these advancements are achieved without necessitating extensive, task-specific tuning.

- **Summary**: Deep hashing techniques have emerged as the predominant approach for efficient image retrieval. Traditionally, these methods utilize pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and VGG-16 as feature extractors. However, the increasing complexity of datasets poses challenges for these backbone architectures in capturing meaningful features essential for effective image retrieval. In this study, we explore the efficacy of employing high-resolution features learned through state-of-the-art techniques for image retrieval tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel methodology that utilizes High-Resolution Networks (HRNets) as the backbone for the deep hashing task, termed High-Resolution Hashing Network (HHNet). Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across all tested benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, MS COCO, and ImageNet. This performance improvement is more pronounced for complex datasets, which highlights the need to learn high-resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of different HRNet configurations and provide insights into the optimal architecture for the deep hashing task

- **Summary**: We present a knowledge augmentation strategy for assessing the diagnostic groups and gait impairment from monocular gait videos. Based on a large-scale pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM), our model learns and improves visual, textual, and numerical representations of patient gait videos, through a collective learning across three distinct modalities: gait videos, class-specific descriptions, and numerical gait parameters. Our specific contributions are two-fold: First, we adopt a knowledge-aware prompt tuning strategy to utilize the class-specific medical description in guiding the text prompt learning. Second, we integrate the paired gait parameters in the form of numerical texts to enhance the numeracy of the textual representation. Results demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) in video-based classification tasks but also adeptly decodes the learned class-specific text features into natural language descriptions using the vocabulary of quantitative gait parameters. The code and the model will be made available at our project page.

- **Summary**: Text recognition, especially for complex scripts like Chinese, faces unique challenges due to its intricate character structures and vast vocabulary. Traditional one-hot encoding methods struggle with the representation of hierarchical radicals, recognition of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) characters, and on-device deployment due to their computational intensity. To address these challenges, we propose HierCode, a novel and lightweight codebook that exploits the innate hierarchical nature of Chinese characters. HierCode employs a multi-hot encoding strategy, leveraging hierarchical binary tree encoding and prototype learning to create distinctive, informative representations for each character. This approach not only facilitates zero-shot recognition of OOV characters by utilizing shared radicals and structures but also excels in line-level recognition tasks by computing similarity with visual features, a notable advantage over existing methods. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, including handwritten, scene, document, web, and ancient text, have showcased HierCode's superiority for both conventional and zero-shot Chinese character or text recognition, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters and fast inference speed.

- **Summary**: In Federated Learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing private data. In semantic segmentation, the Federated source Free Domain Adaptation (FFreeDA) setting is of particular interest, where clients undergo unsupervised training after supervised pretraining at the server side. While few recent works address FL for autonomous vehicles, intrinsic real-world challenges such as the presence of adverse weather conditions and the existence of different autonomous agents are still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we address both problems and introduce a new federated semantic segmentation setting where both car and drone clients co-exist and collaborate. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for this setting which exploits a batch-norm weather-aware strategy to dynamically adapt the model to the different weather conditions, while hyperbolic space prototypes are used to align the heterogeneous client representations. Finally, we introduce FLYAWARE, the first semantic segmentation dataset with adverse weather data for aerial vehicles.

- **Summary**: The majority of recent progress in Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has been achieved with Deep Learning methods, especially models following the end-to-end paradigm, reading input images and producing a linear sequence of tokens. Unfortunately, many music scores, especially piano music, cannot be easily converted to a linear sequence. This has led OMR researchers to use custom linearized encodings, instead of broadly accepted structured formats for music notation. Their diversity makes it difficult to compare the performance of OMR systems directly. To bring recent OMR model progress closer to useful results: (a) We define a sequential format called Linearized MusicXML, allowing to train an end-to-end model directly and maintaining close cohesion and compatibility with the industry-standard MusicXML format. (b) We create a dev and test set for benchmarking typeset OMR with MusicXML ground truth based on the OpenScore Lieder corpus. They contain 1,438 and 1,493 pianoform systems, each with an image from IMSLP. (c) We train and fine-tune an end-to-end model to serve as a baseline on the dataset and employ the TEDn metric to evaluate the model. We also test our model against the recently published synthetic pianoform dataset GrandStaff and surpass the state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: We study pre-training representations for decision-making using video data, which is abundantly available for tasks such as game agents and software testing. Even though significant empirical advances have been made on this problem, a theoretical understanding remains absent. We initiate the theoretical investigation into principled approaches for representation learning and focus on learning the latent state representations of the underlying MDP using video data. We study two types of settings: one where there is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where there is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is temporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background. We study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive learning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive learning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that these approaches can learn the latent state and use it to do efficient downstream RL with polynomial sample complexity. When exogenous noise is also present, we establish a lower bound result showing that the sample complexity of learning from video data can be exponentially worse than learning from action-labeled trajectory data. This partially explains why reinforcement learning with video pre-training is hard. We evaluate these representational learning methods in two visual domains, yielding results that are consistent with our theoretical findings.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose Describe-and-Dissect (DnD), a novel method to describe the roles of hidden neurons in vision networks. DnD utilizes recent advancements in multimodal deep learning to produce complex natural language descriptions, without the need for labeled training data or a predefined set of concepts to choose from. Additionally, DnD is training-free, meaning we don't train any new models and can easily leverage more capable general purpose models in the future. We have conducted extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis to show that DnD outperforms prior work by providing higher quality neuron descriptions. Specifically, our method on average provides the highest quality labels and is more than 2 times as likely to be selected as the best explanation for a neuron than the best baseline.

- **Summary**: Trajectory prediction plays an essential role in autonomous vehicles. While numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness. Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using standard trajectory prediction datasets.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation is crucial for numerous downstream vision tasks and applications. Current discriminative approaches to this problem are limited due to blurry artifacts, while state-of-the-art generative methods suffer from slow sampling due to their SDE nature. Rather than starting from noise, we seek a direct mapping from input image to depth map. We observe that this can be effectively framed using flow matching, since its straight trajectories through solution space offer efficiency and high quality. Our study demonstrates that a pre-trained image diffusion model can serve as an adequate prior for a flow matching depth model, allowing efficient training on only synthetic data to generalize to real images. We find that an auxiliary surface normals loss further improves the depth estimates. Due to the generative nature of our approach, our model reliably predicts the confidence of its depth estimates. On standard benchmarks of complex natural scenes, our lightweight approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance at favorable low computational cost despite only being trained on little synthetic data.

- **Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot image classification by pairing images with textual category names. The expanding variety of Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for specific tasks. Thus, a promising zero-shot image classification strategy is selecting the most appropriate Pre-Trained VLM from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" -- the disparity in VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" -- the discrepancy between the VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the negative impact of these two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to capture the relevance between open-source datasets and target dataset with a transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging those two gaps and enhancing the VLM's capacity estimation for VLM selection. Experiments across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB's effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Action quality assessment (AQA) applies computer vision to quantitatively assess the performance or execution of a human action. Current AQA approaches are end-to-end neural models, which lack transparency and tend to be biased because they are trained on subjective human judgements as ground-truth. To address these issues, we introduce a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA, which uses neural networks to abstract interpretable symbols from video data and makes quality assessments by applying rules to those symbols. We take diving as the case study. We found that domain experts prefer our system and find it more informative than purely neural approaches to AQA in diving. Our system also achieves state-of-the-art action recognition and temporal segmentation, and automatically generates a detailed report that breaks the dive down into its elements and provides objective scoring with visual evidence. As verified by a group of domain experts, this report may be used to assist judges in scoring, help train judges, and provide feedback to divers. We will open-source all of our annotated training data and code for ease of reproducibility.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the novel challenge of ``rewinding'' time from a single captured image to recover the fleeting moments missed just before the shutter button is pressed. This problem poses a significant challenge in computer vision and computational photography, as it requires predicting plausible pre-capture motion from a single static frame, an inherently ill-posed task due to the high degree of freedom in potential pixel movements. We overcome this challenge by leveraging the emerging technology of neuromorphic event cameras, which capture motion information with high temporal resolution, and integrating this data with advanced image-to-video diffusion models. Our proposed framework introduces an event motion adaptor conditioned on event camera data, guiding the diffusion model to generate videos that are visually coherent and physically grounded in the captured events. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to synthesize high-quality videos that effectively ``rewind'' time, showcasing the potential of combining event camera technology with generative models. Our work opens new avenues for research at the intersection of computer vision, computational photography, and generative modeling, offering a forward-thinking solution to capturing missed moments and enhancing future consumer cameras and smartphones.

- **Summary**: The diffusion model has long been plagued by scalability and quadratic complexity issues, especially within transformer-based structures. In this study, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of a State-Space Model called Mamba to extend its applicability to visual data generation. Firstly, we identify a critical oversight in most current Mamba-based vision methods, namely the lack of consideration for spatial continuity in the scan scheme of Mamba. Secondly, building upon this insight, we introduce a simple, plug-and-play, zero-parameter method named Zigzag Mamba, which outperforms Mamba-based baselines and demonstrates improved speed and memory utilization compared to transformer-based baselines. Lastly, we integrate Zigzag Mamba with the Stochastic Interpolant framework to investigate the scalability of the model on large-resolution visual datasets, such as FacesHQ $1024\times 1024$ and UCF101, MultiModal-CelebA-HQ, and MS COCO $256\times 256$.

- **Summary**: Bounding boxes uniquely characterize object detection, where a good detector gives accurate bounding boxes of categories of interest. However, in the real-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find out whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the detector generalization ability. In this work, we find under feature map dropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not change much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable position changes. We compute the box stability score (BoS score) to reflect this stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of bounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout. To obtain BoS score, we use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets and compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test set. We contribute to finding that BoS score has a strong, positive correlation with detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various test environments. This relationship allows us to predict the accuracy of detectors on various real-world test sets without accessing test ground truths, verified on canonical detection tasks such as vehicle detection and pedestrian detection.

- **Summary**: We introduce SynGround, a novel framework that combines data-driven learning and knowledge transfer from various large-scale pretrained models to enhance the visual grounding capabilities of a pretrained vision-and-language model. The knowledge transfer from the models initiates the generation of image descriptions through an image description generator. These descriptions serve dual purposes: they act as prompts for synthesizing images through a text-to-image generator, and as queries for synthesizing text, from which phrases are extracted using a large language model. Finally, we leverage an open-vocabulary object detector to generate synthetic bounding boxes for the synthetic images and texts. We finetune a pretrained vision-and-language model on this dataset by optimizing a mask-attention consistency objective that aligns region annotations with gradient-based model explanations. The resulting model improves the grounding capabilities of an off-the-shelf vision-and-language model. Particularly, SynGround improves the pointing game accuracy of ALBEF on the Flickr30k dataset from 79.38% to 87.26%, and on RefCOCO+ Test A from 69.35% to 79.06% and on RefCOCO+ Test B from 53.77% to 63.67%.

- **Summary**: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) uses contrastive learning from noise image-text pairs to excel at recognizing a wide array of candidates, yet its focus on broad associations hinders the precision in distinguishing subtle differences among fine-grained items. Conversely, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at classifying fine-grained categories, thanks to their substantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the performance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily due to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To synergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented method for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-k similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions. Our proposed approach not only addresses the inherent limitations in fine-grained recognition but also preserves the model's comprehensive knowledge base, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language recognition tasks. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in performance on 5 fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, 11 few-shot image recognition datasets, and the 2 object detection datasets under the zero-shot recognition setting.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in view synthesis and real-time rendering have achieved photorealistic quality at impressive rendering speeds. While Radiance Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models suffer from the risk of generating outdated, copyrighted, incorrect, and biased content. While previous methods have mitigated the issues on a small scale, it is essential to handle them simultaneously in larger-scale real-world scenarios. We propose a two-stage method, Editing Massive Concepts In Diffusion Models (EMCID). The first stage performs memory optimization for each individual concept with dual self-distillation from text alignment loss and diffusion noise prediction loss. The second stage conducts massive concept editing with multi-layer, closed form model editing. We further propose a comprehensive benchmark, named ImageNet Concept Editing Benchmark (ICEB), for evaluating massive concept editing for T2I models with two subtasks, free-form prompts, massive concept categories, and extensive evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments conducted on our proposed benchmark and previous benchmarks demonstrate the superior scalability of EMCID for editing up to 1,000 concepts, providing a practical approach for fast adjustment and re-deployment of T2I diffusion models in real-world applications.

- **Summary**: We explore the impact of training with more diverse datasets, characterized by the number of unique samples, on the performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) under a fixed computational budget. Our findings consistently demonstrate that increasing pretraining data diversity enhances SSL performance, albeit only when the distribution distance to the downstream data is minimal. Notably, even with an exceptionally large pretraining data diversity achieved through methods like web crawling or diffusion-generated data, among other ways, the distribution shift remains a challenge. Our experiments are comprehensive with seven SSL methods using large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and YFCC100M amounting to over 200 GPU days. Code and trained models will be available at https://github.com/hammoudhasan/DiversitySSL .

- **Summary**: Contrast agents in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allow to localize tumors and observe their contrast kinetics, which is essential for cancer characterization and respective treatment decision-making. However, contrast agent administration is not only associated with adverse health risks, but also restricted for patients during pregnancy, and for those with kidney malfunction, or other adverse reactions. With contrast uptake as key biomarker for lesion malignancy, cancer recurrence risk, and treatment response, it becomes pivotal to reduce the dependency on intravenous contrast agent administration. To this end, we propose a multi-conditional latent diffusion model capable of acquisition time-conditioned image synthesis of DCE-MRI temporal sequences. To evaluate medical image synthesis, we additionally propose and validate the Fr\'echet radiomics distance as an image quality measure based on biomarker variability between synthetic and real imaging data. Our results demonstrate our method's ability to generate realistic multi-sequence fat-saturated breast DCE-MRI and uncover the emerging potential of deep learning based contrast kinetics simulation. We publicly share our accessible codebase at https://github.com/RichardObi/ccnet.

- **Summary**: Text-to-motion models excel at efficient human motion generation, but existing approaches lack fine-grained controllability over the generation process. Consequently, modifying subtle postures within a motion or inserting new actions at specific moments remains a challenge, limiting the applicability of these methods in diverse scenarios. In light of these challenges, we introduce CoMo, a Controllable Motion generation model, adept at accurately generating and editing motions by leveraging the knowledge priors of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, CoMo decomposes motions into discrete and semantically meaningful pose codes, with each code encapsulating the semantics of a body part, representing elementary information such as "left knee slightly bent". Given textual inputs, CoMo autoregressively generates sequences of pose codes, which are then decoded into 3D motions. Leveraging pose codes as interpretable representations, an LLM can directly intervene in motion editing by adjusting the pose codes according to editing instructions. Experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves competitive performance in motion generation compared to state-of-the-art models while, in human studies, CoMo substantially surpasses previous work in motion editing abilities.

- **Summary**: We present novel approaches involving generative adversarial networks and diffusion models in order to synthesize high quality, live and spoof fingerprint images while preserving features such as uniqueness and diversity. We generate live fingerprints from noise with a variety of methods, and we use image translation techniques to translate live fingerprint images to spoof. To generate different types of spoof images based on limited training data we incorporate style transfer techniques through a cycle autoencoder equipped with a Wasserstein metric along with Gradient Penalty (CycleWGAN-GP) in order to avoid mode collapse and instability. We find that when the spoof training data includes distinct spoof characteristics, it leads to improved live-to-spoof translation. We assess the diversity and realism of the generated live fingerprint images mainly through the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). Our best diffusion model achieved a FID of 15.78. The comparable WGAN-GP model achieved slightly higher FID while performing better in the uniqueness assessment due to a slightly lower FAR when matched against the training data, indicating better creativity. Moreover, we give example images showing that a DDPM model clearly can generate realistic fingerprint images.

- **Summary**: Virtual Try-on (VTON) involves generating images of a person wearing selected garments. Diffusion-based methods, in particular, can create high-quality images, but they struggle to maintain the identities of the input garments. We identified this problem stems from the specifics in the training formulation for diffusion. To address this, we propose a unique training scheme that limits the scope in which diffusion is trained. We use a control image that perfectly aligns with the target image during training. In turn, this accurately preserves garment details during inference. We demonstrate our method not only effectively conserves garment details but also allows for layering, styling, and shoe try-on. Our method runs multi-garment try-on in a single inference cycle and can support high-quality zoomed-in generations without training in higher resolutions. Finally, we show our method surpasses prior methods in accuracy and quality.

- **Summary**: Cross-view geo-localization aims at localizing a ground-level query image by matching it to its corresponding geo-referenced aerial view. In real-world scenarios, the task requires accommodating diverse ground images captured by users with varying orientations and reduced field of views (FoVs). However, existing learning pipelines are orientation-specific or FoV-specific, demanding separate model training for different ground view variations. Such models heavily depend on the North-aligned spatial correspondence and predefined FoVs in the training data, compromising their robustness across different settings. To tackle this challenge, we propose ConGeo, a single- and cross-modal Contrastive method for Geo-localization: it enhances robustness and consistency in feature representations to improve a model's invariance to orientation and its resilience to FoV variations, by enforcing proximity between ground view variations of the same location. As a generic learning objective for cross-view geo-localization, when integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines, ConGeo significantly boosts the performance of three base models on four geo-localization benchmarks for diverse ground view variations and outperforms competing methods that train separate models for each ground view variation.

- **Summary**: We propose Semantic Facial Feature Control (SeFFeC) - a novel method for fine-grained face shape editing. Our method enables the manipulation of human-understandable, semantic face features, such as nose length or mouth width, which are defined by different groups of facial landmarks. In contrast to existing methods, the use of facial landmarks enables precise measurement of the facial features, which then enables training SeFFeC without any manually annotated labels. SeFFeC consists of a transformer-based encoder network that takes a latent vector of a pre-trained generative model and a facial feature embedding as input, and learns to modify the latent vector to perform the desired face edit operation. To ensure that the desired feature measurement is changed towards the target value without altering uncorrelated features, we introduced a novel semantic face feature loss. Qualitative and quantitative results show that SeFFeC enables precise and fine-grained control of 23 facial features, some of which could not previously be controlled by other methods, without requiring manual annotations. Unlike existing methods, SeFFeC also provides deterministic control over the exact values of the facial features and more localised and disentangled face edits.

- **Summary**: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a hallmark of cerebrovascular disease and multiple sclerosis. Automated WMH segmentation methods enable quantitative analysis via estimation of total lesion load, spatial distribution of lesions, and number of lesions (i.e., number of connected components after thresholding), all of which are correlated with patient outcomes. While the two former measures can generally be estimated robustly, the number of lesions is highly sensitive to noise and segmentation mistakes -- even when small connected components are eroded or disregarded. In this article, we present P-Count, an algebraic WMH counting tool based on persistent homology that accounts for the topological features of WM lesions in a robust manner. Using computational geometry, P-Count takes the persistence of connected components into consideration, effectively filtering out the noisy WMH positives, resulting in a more accurate count of true lesions. We validated P-Count on the ISBI2015 longitudinal lesion segmentation dataset, where it produces significantly more accurate results than direct thresholding.

- **Summary**: Active learning aims to select the minimum amount of data to train a model that performs similarly to a model trained with the entire dataset. We study the potential of active learning for image segmentation in underwater infrastructure inspection tasks, where large amounts of data are typically collected. The pipeline inspection images are usually semantically repetitive but with great variations in quality. We use mutual information as the acquisition function, calculated using Monte Carlo dropout. To assess the effectiveness of the framework, DenseNet and HyperSeg are trained with the CamVid dataset using active learning. In addition, HyperSeg is trained with a pipeline inspection dataset of over 50,000 images. For the pipeline dataset, HyperSeg with active learning achieved 67.5% meanIoU using 12.5% of the data, and 61.4% with the same amount of randomly selected images. This shows that using active learning for segmentation models in underwater inspection tasks can lower the cost significantly.

- **Summary**: Generative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to generate plausible-sounding textual answers that, however, are not always grounded in the input image. We investigate this phenomenon, usually referred to as "hallucination" and show that it stems from an excessive reliance on the language prior. In particular, we show that as more tokens are generated, the reliance on the visual prompt decreases, and this behavior strongly correlates with the emergence of hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations, we introduce Multi-Modal Mutual-Information Decoding (M3ID), a new sampling method for prompt amplification. M3ID amplifies the influence of the reference image over the language prior, hence favoring the generation of tokens with higher mutual information with the visual prompt. M3ID can be applied to any pre-trained autoregressive VLM at inference time without necessitating further training and with minimal computational overhead. If training is an option, we show that M3ID can be paired with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the model's reliance on the prompt image without requiring any labels. Our empirical findings show that our algorithms maintain the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs while reducing hallucinations by mitigating visually ungrounded answers. Specifically, for the LLaVA 13B model, M3ID and M3ID+DPO reduce the percentage of hallucinated objects in captioning tasks by 25% and 28%, respectively, and improve the accuracy on VQA benchmarks such as POPE by 21% and 24%.

- **Summary**: Detecting marine objects inshore presents challenges owing to algorithmic intricacies and complexities in system deployment. We propose a difficulty-aware edge-cloud collaborative sensing system that splits the task into object localization and fine-grained classification. Objects are classified either at the edge or within the cloud, based on their estimated difficulty. The framework comprises a low-power device-tailored front-end model for object localization, classification, and difficulty estimation, along with a transformer-graph convolutional network-based back-end model for fine-grained classification. Our system demonstrates superior performance (mAP@0.5 +4.3%}) on widely used marine object detection datasets, significantly reducing both data transmission volume (by 95.43%) and energy consumption (by 72.7%}) at the system level. We validate the proposed system across various embedded system platforms and in real-world scenarios involving drone deployment.

- **Summary**: Effective weed control plays a crucial role in optimizing crop yield and enhancing agricultural product quality. However, the reliance on herbicide application not only poses a critical threat to the environment but also promotes the emergence of resistant weeds. Fortunately, recent advances in precision weed management enabled by ML and DL provide a sustainable alternative. Despite great progress, existing algorithms are mainly developed based on supervised learning approaches, which typically demand large-scale datasets with manual-labeled annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As such, label-efficient learning methods, especially semi-supervised learning, have gained increased attention in the broader domain of computer vision and have demonstrated promising performance. These methods aim to utilize a small number of labeled data samples along with a great number of unlabeled samples to develop high-performing models comparable to the supervised learning counterpart trained on a large amount of labeled data samples. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a semi-supervised learning framework for multi-class weed detection, employing two well-known object detection frameworks, namely FCOS and Faster-RCNN. Specifically, we evaluate a generalized student-teacher framework with an improved pseudo-label generation module to produce reliable pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To enhance generalization, an ensemble student network is employed to facilitate the training process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve approximately 76\% and 96\% detection accuracy as the supervised methods with only 10\% of labeled data in CottenWeedDet3 and CottonWeedDet12, respectively. We offer access to the source code, contributing a valuable resource for ongoing semi-supervised learning research in weed detection and beyond.

- **Summary**: Facial action unit (AU) detection, aiming to classify AU present in the facial image, has long suffered from insufficient AU annotations. In this paper, we aim to mitigate this data scarcity issue by learning AU representations from a large number of unlabelled facial videos in a contrastive learning paradigm. We formulate the self-supervised AU representation learning signals in two-fold: (1) AU representation should be frame-wisely discriminative within a short video clip; (2) Facial frames sampled from different identities but show analogous facial AUs should have consistent AU representations. As to achieve these goals, we propose to contrastively learn the AU representation within a video clip and devise a cross-identity reconstruction mechanism to learn the person-independent representations. Specially, we adopt a margin-based temporal contrastive learning paradigm to perceive the temporal AU coherence and evolution characteristics within a clip that consists of consecutive input facial frames. Moreover, the cross-identity reconstruction mechanism facilitates pushing the faces from different identities but show analogous AUs close in the latent embedding space. Experimental results on three public AU datasets demonstrate that the learned AU representation is discriminative for AU detection. Our method outperforms other contrastive learning methods and significantly closes the performance gap between the self-supervised and supervised AU detection approaches.

- **Summary**: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has gained significant research interest in recent years due to its potential applications in real-world scenarios. However, existing VLN methods struggle with the issue of spurious associations, resulting in poor generalization with a significant performance gap between seen and unseen environments. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a unified framework CausalVLN based on the causal learning paradigm to train a robust navigator capable of learning unbiased feature representations. Specifically, we establish reasonable assumptions about confounders for vision and language in VLN using the structured causal model (SCM). Building upon this, we propose an iterative backdoor-based representation learning (IBRL) method that allows for the adaptive and effective intervention on confounders. Furthermore, we introduce the visual and linguistic backdoor causal encoders to enable unbiased feature expression for multi-modalities during training and validation, enhancing the agent's capability to generalize across different environments. Experiments on three VLN datasets (R2R, RxR, and REVERIE) showcase the superiority of our proposed method over previous state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, detailed visualization analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of CausalVLN in significantly narrowing down the performance gap between seen and unseen environments, underscoring its strong generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Scene depth estimation from paintings can streamline the process of 3D sculpture creation so that visually impaired people appreciate the paintings with tactile sense. However, measuring depth of oriental landscape painting images is extremely challenging due to its unique method of depicting depth and poor preservation. To address the problem of scene depth estimation from oriental landscape painting images, we propose a novel framework that consists of two-step Image-to-Image translation method with CLIP-based image matching at the front end to predict the real scene image that best matches with the given oriental landscape painting image. Then, we employ a pre-trained SOTA depth estimation model for the generated real scene image. In the first step, CycleGAN converts an oriental landscape painting image into a pseudo-real scene image. We utilize CLIP to semantically match landscape photo images with an oriental landscape painting image for training CycleGAN in an unsupervised manner. Then, the pseudo-real scene image and oriental landscape painting image are fed into DiffuseIT to predict a final real scene image in the second step. Finally, we measure depth of the generated real scene image using a pre-trained depth estimation model such as MiDaS. Experimental results show that our approach performs well enough to predict real scene images corresponding to oriental landscape painting images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the depth of oriental landscape painting images. Our research potentially assists visually impaired people in experiencing paintings in diverse ways. We will release our code and resulting dataset.

- **Summary**: In the dynamic realms of machine learning and deep learning, the robustness and reliability of models are paramount, especially in critical real-world applications. A fundamental challenge in this sphere is managing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples, significantly increasing the risks of model misclassification and uncertainty. Our work addresses this challenge by enhancing the detection and management of OOD samples in neural networks. We introduce OOD-R (Out-of-Distribution-Rectified), a meticulously curated collection of open-source datasets with enhanced noise reduction properties. In-Distribution (ID) noise in existing OOD datasets can lead to inaccurate evaluation of detection algorithms. Recognizing this, OOD-R incorporates noise filtering technologies to refine the datasets, ensuring a more accurate and reliable evaluation of OOD detection algorithms. This approach not only improves the overall quality of data but also aids in better distinguishing between OOD and ID samples, resulting in up to a 2.5\% improvement in model accuracy and a minimum 3.2\% reduction in false positives. Furthermore, we present ActFun, an innovative method that fine-tunes the model's response to diverse inputs, thereby improving the stability of feature extraction and minimizing specificity issues. ActFun addresses the common problem of model overconfidence in OOD detection by strategically reducing the influence of hidden units, which enhances the model's capability to estimate OOD uncertainty more accurately. Implementing ActFun in the OOD-R dataset has led to significant performance enhancements, including an 18.42\% increase in AUROC of the GradNorm method and a 16.93\% decrease in FPR95 of the Energy method. Overall, our research not only advances the methodologies in OOD detection but also emphasizes the importance of dataset integrity for accurate algorithm evaluation.

- **Summary**: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) targets knowledge transfer in the presence of both covariate and label shifts. Recently, Source-free Universal Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) has emerged to achieve UniDA without access to source data, which tends to be more practical due to data protection policies. The main challenge lies in determining whether covariate-shifted samples belong to target-private unknown categories. Existing methods tackle this either through hand-crafted thresholding or by developing time-consuming iterative clustering strategies. In this paper, we propose a new idea of LEArning Decomposition (LEAD), which decouples features into source-known and -unknown components to identify target-private data. Technically, LEAD initially leverages the orthogonal decomposition analysis for feature decomposition. Then, LEAD builds instance-level decision boundaries to adaptively identify target-private data. Extensive experiments across various UniDA scenarios have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of LEAD. Notably, in the OPDA scenario on VisDA dataset, LEAD outperforms GLC by 3.5% overall H-score and reduces 75% time to derive pseudo-labeling decision boundaries. Besides, LEAD is also appealing in that it is complementary to most existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ispc-lab/LEAD.

- **Summary**: Deep Text-to-Image Synthesis (TIS) models such as Stable Diffusion have recently gained significant popularity for creative Text-to-image generation. Yet, for domain-specific scenarios, tuning-free Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) is of greater importance for application developers, which modify objects or object properties in images by manipulating feature components in attention layers during the generation process. However, little is known about what semantic meanings these attention layers have learned and which parts of the attention maps contribute to the success of image editing. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth probing analysis and demonstrate that cross-attention maps in Stable Diffusion often contain object attribution information that can result in editing failures. In contrast, self-attention maps play a crucial role in preserving the geometric and shape details of the source image during the transformation to the target image. Our analysis offers valuable insights into understanding cross and self-attention maps in diffusion models. Moreover, based on our findings, we simplify popular image editing methods and propose a more straightforward yet more stable and efficient tuning-free procedure that only modifies self-attention maps of the specified attention layers during the denoising process. Experimental results show that our simplified method consistently surpasses the performance of popular approaches on multiple datasets.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Reconstructing High Dynamic Range (HDR) video from image sequences captured with alternating exposures is challenging, especially in the presence of large camera or object motion. Existing methods typically align low dynamic range sequences using optical flow or attention mechanism for deghosting. However, they often struggle to handle large complex motions and are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a robust and efficient flow estimator tailored for real-time HDR video reconstruction, named HDRFlow. HDRFlow has three novel designs: an HDR-domain alignment loss (HALoss), an efficient flow network with a multi-size large kernel (MLK), and a new HDR flow training scheme. The HALoss supervises our flow network to learn an HDR-oriented flow for accurate alignment in saturated and dark regions. The MLK can effectively model large motions at a negligible cost. In addition, we incorporate synthetic data, Sintel, into our training dataset, utilizing both its provided forward flow and backward flow generated by us to supervise our flow network, enhancing our performance in large motion regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDRFlow outperforms previous methods on standard benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, HDRFlow is the first real-time HDR video reconstruction method for video sequences captured with alternating exposures, capable of processing 720p resolution inputs at 25ms.

- **Summary**: The main objective of the Multiple Kernel k-Means (MKKM) algorithm is to extract non-linear information and achieve optimal clustering by optimizing base kernel matrices. Current methods enhance information diversity and reduce redundancy by exploiting interdependencies among multiple kernels based on correlations or dissimilarities. Nevertheless, relying solely on a single metric, such as correlation or dissimilarity, to define kernel relationships introduces bias and incomplete characterization. Consequently, this limitation hinders efficient information extraction, ultimately compromising clustering performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel method that systematically integrates both kernel correlation and dissimilarity. Our approach comprehensively captures kernel relationships, facilitating more efficient classification information extraction and improving clustering performance. By emphasizing the coherence between kernel correlation and dissimilarity, our method offers a more objective and transparent strategy for extracting non-linear information and significantly improving clustering precision, supported by theoretical rationale. We assess the performance of our algorithm on 13 challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over contemporary state-of-the-art MKKM techniques.

- **Summary**: This paper presents significant advancements in the field of abstract reasoning, particularly for Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Bongard-Logo problems. We first introduce D2C, a method that redefines concept boundaries in these domains and bridges the gap between high-level concepts and their low-dimensional representations. Leveraging this foundation, we propose D3C, a novel approach for tackling Bongard-Logo problems. D3C estimates the distributions of image representations and measures their Sinkhorn distance to achieve remarkable reasoning accuracy. This innovative method provides new insights into the relationships between images and advances the state-of-the-art in abstract reasoning. To further enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing performance, we introduce D3C-cos. This variant of D3C constrains distribution distances, offering a more computationally efficient solution for RPM problems while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we present Lico-Net, a baseline network for RPM that integrates D3C and D3C-cos. By estimating and constraining the distributions of regularity representations, Lico-Net addresses both problem-solving and interpretability challenges, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we extend our methodology with D4C, an adversarial approach that further refines concept boundaries compared to D2C. Tailored for RPM and Bongard-Logo problems, D4C demonstrates significant improvements in addressing the challenges of abstract reasoning. Overall, our contributions advance the field of abstract reasoning, providing new perspectives and practical solutions to long-standing problems.

- **Summary**: Chinese landscape painting has a unique and artistic style, and its drawing technique is highly abstract in both the use of color and the realistic representation of objects. Previous methods focus on transferring from modern photos to ancient ink paintings. However, little attention has been paid to translating landscape paintings into modern photos. To solve such problems, in this paper, we (1) propose DLP-GAN (Draw Modern Chinese Landscape Photos with Generative Adversarial Network), an unsupervised cross-domain image translation framework with a novel asymmetric cycle mapping, and (2) introduce a generator based on a dense-fusion module to match different translation directions. Moreover, a dual-consistency loss is proposed to balance the realism and abstraction of model painting. In this way, our model can draw landscape photos and sketches in the modern sense. Finally, based on our collection of modern landscape and sketch datasets, we compare the images generated by our model with other benchmarks. Extensive experiments including user studies show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Abstract visual reasoning is a characteristically human ability, allowing the identification of relational patterns that are abstracted away from object features, and the systematic generalization of those patterns to unseen problems. Recent work has demonstrated strong systematic generalization in visual reasoning tasks involving multi-object inputs, through the integration of slot-based methods used for extracting object-centric representations coupled with strong inductive biases for relational abstraction. However, this approach was limited to problems containing a single rule, and was not scalable to visual reasoning problems containing a large number of objects. Other recent work proposed Abstractors, an extension of Transformers that incorporates strong relational inductive biases, thereby inheriting the Transformer's scalability and multi-head architecture, but it has yet to be demonstrated how this approach might be applied to multi-object visual inputs. Here we combine the strengths of the above approaches and propose Slot Abstractors, an approach to abstract visual reasoning that can be scaled to problems involving a large number of objects and multiple relations among them. The approach displays state-of-the-art performance across four abstract visual reasoning tasks.

- **Summary**: Dense object counting or crowd counting has come a long way thanks to the recent development in the vision community. However, indiscernible object counting, which aims to count the number of targets that are blended with respect to their surroundings, has been a challenge. Image-based object counting datasets have been the mainstream of the current publicly available datasets. Therefore, we propose a large-scale dataset called YoutubeFish-35, which contains a total of 35 sequences of high-definition videos with high frame-per-second and more than 150,000 annotated center points across a selected variety of scenes. For benchmarking purposes, we select three mainstream methods for dense object counting and carefully evaluate them on the newly collected dataset. We propose TransVidCount, a new strong baseline that combines density and regression branches along the temporal domain in a unified framework and can effectively tackle indiscernible object counting with state-of-the-art performance on YoutubeFish-35 dataset.

- **Summary**: For robots to perform assistive tasks in unstructured home environments, they must learn and reason on the semantic knowledge of the environments. Despite a resurgence in the development of semantic reasoning architectures, these methods assume that all the training data is available a priori. However, each user's environment is unique and can continue to change over time, which makes these methods unsuitable for personalized home service robots. Although research in continual learning develops methods that can learn and adapt over time, most of these methods are tested in the narrow context of object classification on static image datasets. In this paper, we combine ideas from continual learning, semantic reasoning, and interactive machine learning literature and develop a novel interactive continual learning architecture for continual learning of semantic knowledge in a home environment through human-robot interaction. The architecture builds on core cognitive principles of learning and memory for efficient and real-time learning of new knowledge from humans. We integrate our architecture with a physical mobile manipulator robot and perform extensive system evaluations in a laboratory environment over two months. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture to allow a physical robot to continually adapt to the changes in the environment from limited data provided by the users (experimenters), and use the learned knowledge to perform object fetching tasks.

- **Summary**: The rise of machine learning in recent years has brought benefits to various research fields such as wide fire detection. Nevertheless, small object detection and rare object detection remain a challenge. To address this problem, we present a dataset automata that can generate ground truth paired datasets using diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce a mask-guided diffusion framework that can fusion the wildfire into the existing images while the flame position and size can be precisely controlled. In advance, to fill the gap that the dataset of wildfire images in specific scenarios is missing, we vary the background of synthesized images by controlling both the text prompt and input image. Furthermore, to solve the color tint problem or the well-known domain shift issue, we apply the CLIP model to filter the generated massive dataset to preserve quality. Thus, our proposed framework can generate a massive dataset of that images are high-quality and ground truth-paired, which well addresses the needs of the annotated datasets in specific tasks.

- **Summary**: Real-time processing is crucial in autonomous driving systems due to the imperative of instantaneous decision-making and rapid response. In real-world scenarios, autonomous vehicles are continuously tasked with interpreting their surroundings, analyzing intricate sensor data, and making decisions within split seconds to ensure safety through numerous computer vision tasks. In this paper, we present a new real-time multi-task network adept at three vital autonomous driving tasks: monocular 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and dense depth estimation. To counter the challenge of negative transfer, which is the prevalent issue in multi-task learning, we introduce a task-adaptive attention generator. This generator is designed to automatically discern interrelations across the three tasks and arrange the task-sharing pattern, all while leveraging the efficiency of the hard-parameter sharing approach. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is pioneering in its capability to concurrently handle multiple tasks, notably 3D object detection, while maintaining real-time processing speeds. Our rigorously optimized network, when tested on the Cityscapes-3D datasets, consistently outperforms various baseline models. Moreover, an in-depth ablation study substantiates the efficacy of the methodologies integrated into our framework.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning, a challenging task in machine learning, aims to learn a classifier adaptable to recognize new, unseen classes with limited labeled examples. Meta-learning has emerged as a prominent framework for few-shot learning. Its training framework is originally a task-level learning method, such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and Prototypical Networks. And a recently proposed training paradigm called Meta-Baseline, which consists of sequential pre-training and meta-training stages, gains state-of-the-art performance. However, as a non-end-to-end training method, indicating the meta-training stage can only begin after the completion of pre-training, Meta-Baseline suffers from higher training cost and suboptimal performance due to the inherent conflicts of the two training stages. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end training paradigm consisting of two alternative loops. In the outer loop, we calculate cross entropy loss on the entire training set while updating only the final linear layer. In the inner loop, we employ the original meta-learning training mode to calculate the loss and incorporate gradients from the outer loss to guide the parameter updates. This training paradigm not only converges quickly but also outperforms existing baselines, indicating that information from the overall training set and the meta-learning training paradigm could mutually reinforce one another. Moreover, being model-agnostic, our framework achieves significant performance gains, surpassing the baseline systems by approximate 1%.

- **Summary**: Second-order methods can converge much faster than first-order methods by incorporating second-order derivates or statistics, but they are far less prevalent in deep learning due to their computational inefficiency. To handle this, many of the existing solutions focus on reducing the size of the matrix to be inverted. However, it is still needed to perform the inverse operator in each iteration. In this paper, we present a fast natural gradient descent (FNGD) method, which only requires computing the inverse during the first epoch. Firstly, we reformulate the gradient preconditioning formula in the natural gradient descent (NGD) as a weighted sum of per-sample gradients using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. Building upon this, to avoid the iterative inverse operation involved in computing coefficients, the weighted coefficients are shared across epochs without affecting the empirical performance.   FNGD approximates the NGD as a fixed-coefficient weighted sum, akin to the average sum in first-order methods. Consequently, the computational complexity of FNGD can approach that of first-order methods. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed FNGD, we perform empirical evaluations on image classification and machine translation tasks. For training ResNet-18 on the CIFAR-100 dataset, FNGD can achieve a speedup of 2.05$\times$ compared with KFAC. For training Transformer on Multi30K, FNGD outperforms AdamW by 24 BLEU score while requiring almost the same training time.

- **Summary**: Most continual segmentation methods tackle the problem as a per-pixel classification task. However, such a paradigm is very challenging, and we find query-based segmenters with built-in objectness have inherent advantages compared with per-pixel ones, as objectness has strong transfer ability and forgetting resistance. Based on these findings, we propose CoMasTRe by disentangling continual segmentation into two stages: forgetting-resistant continual objectness learning and well-researched continual classification. CoMasTRe uses a two-stage segmenter learning class-agnostic mask proposals at the first stage and leaving recognition to the second stage. During continual learning, a simple but effective distillation is adopted to strengthen objectness. To further mitigate the forgetting of old classes, we design a multi-label class distillation strategy suited for segmentation. We assess the effectiveness of CoMasTRe on PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms per-pixel and query-based methods on both datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/jordangong/CoMasTRe.

- **Summary**: Layout-aware text-to-image generation is a task to generate multi-object images that reflect layout conditions in addition to text conditions. The current layout-aware text-to-image diffusion models still have several issues, including mismatches between the text and layout conditions and quality degradation of generated images. This paper proposes a novel layout-aware text-to-image diffusion model called NoiseCollage to tackle these issues. During the denoising process, NoiseCollage independently estimates noises for individual objects and then crops and merges them into a single noise. This operation helps avoid condition mismatches; in other words, it can put the right objects in the right places. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that NoiseCollage outperforms several state-of-the-art models. These successful results indicate that the crop-and-merge operation of noises is a reasonable strategy to control image generation. We also show that NoiseCollage can be integrated with ControlNet to use edges, sketches, and pose skeletons as additional conditions. Experimental results show that this integration boosts the layout accuracy of ControlNet. The code is available at https://github.com/univ-esuty/noisecollage.

- **Summary**: With the widespread application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the traditional model based denoising algorithms are now outperformed. However, CNNs face two problems. First, they are computationally demanding, which makes their deployment especially difficult for mobile terminals. Second, experimental evidence shows that CNNs often over-smooth regular textures present in images, in contrast to traditional non-local models. In this letter, we propose a solution to both issues by combining a nonlocal algorithm with a lightweight residual CNN. This solution gives full latitude to the advantages of both models. We apply this framework to two GPU implementations of classic nonlocal algorithms (NLM and BM3D) and observe a substantial gain in both cases, performing better than the state-of-the-art with low computational requirements. Our solution is between 10 and 20 times faster than CNNs with equivalent performance and attains higher PSNR. In addition the final method shows a notable gain on images containing complex textures like the ones of the MIT Moire dataset.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, dubbed VastTrack, towards facilitating the development of more general visual tracking via encompassing abundant classes and videos. VastTrack possesses several attractive properties: (1) Vast Object Category. In particular, it covers target objects from 2,115 classes, largely surpassing object categories of existing popular benchmarks (e.g., GOT-10k with 563 classes and LaSOT with 70 categories). With such vast object classes, we expect to learn more general object tracking. (2) Larger scale. Compared with current benchmarks, VastTrack offers 50,610 sequences with 4.2 million frames, which makes it to date the largest benchmark regarding the number of videos, and thus could benefit training even more powerful visual trackers in the deep learning era. (3) Rich Annotation. Besides conventional bounding box annotations, VastTrack also provides linguistic descriptions for the videos. The rich annotations of VastTrack enables development of both the vision-only and the vision-language tracking. To ensure precise annotation, all videos are manually labeled with multiple rounds of careful inspection and refinement. To understand performance of existing trackers and to provide baselines for future comparison, we extensively assess 25 representative trackers. The results, not surprisingly, show significant drops compared to those on current datasets due to lack of abundant categories and videos from diverse scenarios for training, and more efforts are required to improve general tracking. Our VastTrack and all the evaluation results will be made publicly available https://github.com/HengLan/VastTrack.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised learning is a sound measure to relieve the strict demand of abundant annotated datasets, especially for challenging multi-organ segmentation . However, most existing SSL methods predict pixels in a single image independently, ignoring the relations among images and categories. In this paper, we propose a two-stage Dual Contrastive Learning Network for semi-supervised MoS, which utilizes global and local contrastive learning to strengthen the relations among images and classes. Concretely, in Stage 1, we develop a similarity-guided global contrastive learning to explore the implicit continuity and similarity among images and learn global context. Then, in Stage 2, we present an organ-aware local contrastive learning to further attract the class representations. To ease the computation burden, we introduce a mask center computation algorithm to compress the category representations for local contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on the public 2017 ACDC dataset and an in-house RC-OARs dataset has demonstrated the superior performance of our method.

- **Summary**: Registration of point clouds collected from a pair of distant vehicles provides a comprehensive and accurate 3D view of the driving scenario, which is vital for driving safety related applications, yet existing literature suffers from the expensive pose label acquisition and the deficiency to generalize to new data distributions. In this paper, we propose EYOC, an unsupervised distant point cloud registration method that adapts to new point cloud distributions on the fly, requiring no global pose labels. The core idea of EYOC is to train a feature extractor in a progressive fashion, where in each round, the feature extractor, trained with near point cloud pairs, can label slightly farther point cloud pairs, enabling self-supervision on such far point cloud pairs. This process continues until the derived extractor can be used to register distant point clouds. Particularly, to enable high-fidelity correspondence label generation, we devise an effective spatial filtering scheme to select the most representative correspondences to register a point cloud pair, and then utilize the aligned point clouds to discover more correct correspondences. Experiments show that EYOC can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art supervised methods at a lower training cost. Moreover, it outwits supervised methods regarding generalization performance on new data distributions.

- **Summary**: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn novel tasks with very few labeled samples by leveraging experience from \emph{related} training tasks. In this paper, we try to understand FSL by delving into two key questions: (1) How to quantify the relationship between \emph{training} and \emph{novel} tasks? (2) How does the relationship affect the \emph{adaptation difficulty} on novel tasks for different models? To answer the two questions, we introduce Task Attribute Distance (TAD) built upon attributes as a metric to quantify the task relatedness. Unlike many existing metrics, TAD is model-agnostic, making it applicable to different FSL models. Then, we utilize TAD metric to establish a theoretical connection between task relatedness and task adaptation difficulty. By deriving the generalization error bound on a novel task, we discover how TAD measures the adaptation difficulty on novel tasks for FSL models. To validate our TAD metric and theoretical findings, we conduct experiments on three benchmarks. Our experimental results confirm that TAD metric effectively quantifies the task relatedness and reflects the adaptation difficulty on novel tasks for various FSL methods, even if some of them do not learn attributes explicitly or human-annotated attributes are not available. Finally, we present two applications of the proposed TAD metric: data augmentation and test-time intervention, which further verify its effectiveness and general applicability.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed for the computational reduction of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to mitigate adverse side effects while preserving diagnostic value. Currently, the two main challenges for these approaches are the accurate prediction of contrast enhancement and the synthesis of realistic images. In this work, we address both challenges by utilizing the contrast signal encoded in the subtraction images of pre-contrast and post-contrast image pairs. To avoid the synthesis of any noise or artifacts and solely focus on contrast signal extraction and enhancement from low-dose subtraction images, we train our DL model using noise-free standard-dose subtraction images as targets. As a result, our model predicts the contrast enhancement signal only; thereby enabling synthesization of images beyond the standard dose. Furthermore, we adapt the embedding idea of recent diffusion-based models to condition our model on physical parameters affecting the contrast enhancement behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic and real datasets using various scanners, field strengths, and contrast agents.

- **Summary**: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely used medical imaging modality, and as it is based on ionizing radiation, it is desirable to minimize the radiation dose. However, a reduced radiation dose comes with reduced image quality, and reconstruction from low-dose CT (LDCT) data is still a challenging task which is subject to research. According to the LoDoPaB-CT benchmark, a benchmark for LDCT reconstruction, many state-of-the-art methods use pipelines involving UNet-type architectures. Specifically the top ranking method, ItNet, employs a three-stage process involving filtered backprojection (FBP), a UNet trained on CT data, and an iterative refinement step. In this paper, we propose a less complex two-stage method. The first stage also employs FBP, while the novelty lies in the training strategy for the second stage, characterized as the CT image enhancement stage. The crucial point of our approach is that the neural network is pretrained on a distinctly different pretraining task with non-CT data, namely Gaussian noise removal on a variety of natural grayscale images (photographs). We then fine-tune this network for the downstream task of CT image enhancement using pairs of LDCT images and corresponding normal-dose CT images (NDCT). Despite being notably simpler than the state-of-the-art, as the pretraining did not depend on domain-specific CT data and no further iterative refinement step was necessary, the proposed two-stage method achieves competitive results. The proposed method achieves a shared top ranking in the LoDoPaB-CT challenge and a first position with respect to the SSIM metric.

- **Summary**: It is especially challenging to achieve real-time human motion tracking on a standalone VR Head-Mounted Display (HMD) such as Meta Quest and PICO. In this paper, we propose HMD-Poser, the first unified approach to recover full-body motions using scalable sparse observations from HMD and body-worn IMUs. In particular, it can support a variety of input scenarios, such as HMD, HMD+2IMUs, HMD+3IMUs, etc. The scalability of inputs may accommodate users' choices for both high tracking accuracy and easy-to-wear. A lightweight temporal-spatial feature learning network is proposed in HMD-Poser to guarantee that the model runs in real-time on HMDs. Furthermore, HMD-Poser presents online body shape estimation to improve the position accuracy of body joints. Extensive experimental results on the challenging AMASS dataset show that HMD-Poser achieves new state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and real-time performance. We also build a new free-dancing motion dataset to evaluate HMD-Poser's on-device performance and investigate the performance gap between synthetic data and real-captured sensor data. Finally, we demonstrate our HMD-Poser with a real-time Avatar-driving application on a commercial HMD. Our code and free-dancing motion dataset are available https://pico-ai-team.github.io/hmd-poser

- **Summary**: In classification, it is usual to observe that models trained on a given set of classes can generalize to previously unseen ones, suggesting the ability to learn beyond the initial task. This ability is often leveraged in the context of transfer learning where a pretrained model can be used to process new classes, with or without fine tuning. Surprisingly, there are a few papers looking at the theoretical roots beyond this phenomenon. In this work, we are interested in laying the foundations of such a theoretical framework for transferability between sets of classes. Namely, we establish a partially ordered set of subsets of classes. This tool allows to represent which subset of classes can generalize to others. In a more practical setting, we explore the ability of our framework to predict which subset of classes can lead to the best performance when testing on all of them. We also explore few-shot learning, where transfer is the golden standard. Our work contributes to better understanding of transfer mechanics and model generalization.

- **Summary**: Utilizing multi-view inputs to synthesize novel-view images, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a popular research topic in 3D vision. In this work, we introduce a Generalizable Semantic Neural Radiance Field (GSNeRF), which uniquely takes image semantics into the synthesis process so that both novel view images and the associated semantic maps can be produced for unseen scenes. Our GSNeRF is composed of two stages: Semantic Geo-Reasoning and Depth-Guided Visual rendering. The former is able to observe multi-view image inputs to extract semantic and geometry features from a scene. Guided by the resulting image geometry information, the latter performs both image and semantic rendering with improved performances. Our experiments not only confirm that GSNeRF performs favorably against prior works on both novel-view image and semantic segmentation synthesis but the effectiveness of our sampling strategy for visual rendering is further verified.

- **Summary**: Recently, with increasing interest in pet healthcare, the demand for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems in veterinary medicine has increased. The development of veterinary CAD has stagnated due to a lack of sufficient radiology data. To overcome the challenge, we propose a generative active learning framework based on a variational autoencoder. This approach aims to alleviate the scarcity of reliable data for CAD systems in veterinary medicine. This study utilizes datasets comprising cardiomegaly radiograph data. After removing annotations and standardizing images, we employed a framework for data augmentation, which consists of a data generation phase and a query phase for filtering the generated data. The experimental results revealed that as the data generated through this framework was added to the training data of the generative model, the frechet inception distance consistently decreased from 84.14 to 50.75 on the radiograph. Subsequently, when the generated data were incorporated into the training of the classification model, the false positive of the confusion matrix also improved from 0.16 to 0.66 on the radiograph. The proposed framework has the potential to address the challenges of data scarcity in medical CAD, contributing to its advancement.

- **Summary**: Video stabilization is a longstanding computer vision problem, particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization which synthesize full frames add to the complexity of this task. These techniques aim to stabilize videos by synthesizing full frames while enhancing the stability of the considered video. This intensifies the complexity of the task due to the distinct mix of unique motion profiles and visual content present in each video sequence, making robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. In our study, we introduce a novel approach to enhance the performance of pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization by adapting these models to individual input video sequences. The proposed adaptation exploits low-level visual cues accessible during test-time to improve both the stability and quality of resulting videos. We highlight the efficacy of our methodology of "test-time adaptation" through simple fine-tuning of one of these models, followed by significant stability gain via the integration of meta-learning techniques. Notably, significant improvement is achieved with only a single adaptation step. The versatility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by consistently improving the performance of various pixel-level synthesis models for video stabilization in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: Identifying flood affected areas in remote sensing data is a critical problem in earth observation to analyze flood impact and drive responses. While a number of methods have been proposed in the literature, there are two main limitations in available flood detection datasets: (1) a lack of region variability is commonly observed and/or (2) they require to distinguish permanent water bodies from flooded areas from a single image, which becomes an ill-posed setup. Consequently, we extend the globally diverse MMFlood dataset to multi-date by providing one year of Sentinel-1 observations around each flood event. To our surprise, we notice that the definition of flooded pixels in MMFlood is inconsistent when observing the entire image sequence. Hence, we re-frame the flood detection task as a temporal anomaly detection problem, where anomalous water bodies are segmented from a Sentinel-1 temporal sequence. From this definition, we provide a simple method inspired by the popular video change detector ViBe, results of which quantitatively align with the SAR image time series, providing a reasonable baseline for future works.

- **Summary**: Currently, infrared imaging technology enjoys widespread usage, with infrared object detection technology experiencing a surge in prominence. While previous studies have delved into physical attacks on infrared object detectors, the implementation of these techniques remains complex. For instance, some approaches entail the use of bulb boards or infrared QR suits as perturbations to execute attacks, which entail costly optimization and cumbersome deployment processes. Other methodologies involve the utilization of irregular aerogel as physical perturbations for infrared attacks, albeit at the expense of optimization expenses and perceptibility issues. In this study, we propose a novel infrared physical attack termed Adversarial Infrared Geometry (\textbf{AdvIG}), which facilitates efficient black-box query attacks by modeling diverse geometric shapes (lines, triangles, ellipses) and optimizing their physical parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of AdvIG. In digital attack experiments, line, triangle, and ellipse patterns achieve attack success rates of 93.1\%, 86.8\%, and 100.0\%, respectively, with average query times of 71.7, 113.1, and 2.57, respectively, thereby confirming the efficiency of AdvIG. Physical attack experiments are conducted to assess the attack success rate of AdvIG at different distances. On average, the line, triangle, and ellipse achieve attack success rates of 61.1\%, 61.2\%, and 96.2\%, respectively. Further experiments are conducted to comprehensively analyze AdvIG, including ablation experiments, transfer attack experiments, and adversarial defense mechanisms. Given the superior performance of our method as a simple and efficient black-box adversarial attack in both digital and physical environments, we advocate for widespread attention to AdvIG.

- **Summary**: With the rapid advancement of hardware and software technologies, research in autonomous driving has seen significant growth. The prevailing framework for multi-sensor autonomous driving encompasses sensor installation, perception, path planning, decision-making, and motion control. At the perception phase, a common approach involves utilizing neural networks to infer 3D bounding box (Bbox) attributes from raw sensor data, including classification, size, and orientation. In this paper, we present a novel attribute and its corresponding algorithm: 3D object visibility. By incorporating multi-task learning, the introduction of this attribute, visibility, negligibly affects the model's effectiveness and efficiency. Our proposal of this attribute and its computational strategy aims to expand the capabilities for downstream tasks, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of real-time autonomous driving in real-world scenarios.

- **Summary**: In the field of chemical structure recognition, the task of converting molecular images into graph structures and SMILES string stands as a significant challenge, primarily due to the varied drawing styles and conventions prevalent in chemical literature. To bridge this gap, we proposed MolNexTR, a novel image-to-graph deep learning model that collaborates to fuse the strengths of ConvNext, a powerful Convolutional Neural Network variant, and Vision-TRansformer. This integration facilitates a more nuanced extraction of both local and global features from molecular images. MolNexTR can predict atoms and bonds simultaneously and understand their layout rules. It also excels at flexibly integrating symbolic chemistry principles to discern chirality and decipher abbreviated structures. We further incorporate a series of advanced algorithms, including improved data augmentation module, image contamination module, and a post-processing module to get the final SMILES output. These modules synergistically enhance the model's robustness against the diverse styles of molecular imagery found in real literature. In our test sets, MolNexTR has demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 81-97%, marking a significant advancement in the domain of molecular structure recognition. Scientific contribution: MolNexTR is a novel image-to-graph model that incorporates a unique dual-stream encoder to extract complex molecular image features, and combines chemical rules to predict atoms and bonds while understanding atom and bond layout rules. In addition, it employs a series of novel augmentation algorithms to significantly enhance the robustness and performance of the model.



### Causal Prototype-inspired Contrast Adaptation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation of High-resolution Remote Sensing Imagery

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing imagery (HRSI) suffers from the domain shift, resulting in poor performance of the model in another unseen domain. Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) semantic segmentation aims to adapt the semantic segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, the existing UDA semantic segmentation models tend to align pixels or features based on statistical information related to labels in source and target domain data, and make predictions accordingly, which leads to uncertainty and fragility of prediction results. In this paper, we propose a causal prototype-inspired contrast adaptation (CPCA) method to explore the invariant causal mechanisms between different HRSIs domains and their semantic labels. It firstly disentangles causal features and bias features from the source and target domain images through a causal feature disentanglement module. Then, a causal prototypical contrast module is used to learn domain invariant causal features. To further de-correlate causal and bias features, a causal intervention module is introduced to intervene on the bias features to generate counterfactual unbiased samples. By forcing the causal features to meet the principles of separability, invariance and intervention, CPCA can simulate the causal factors of source and target domains, and make decisions on the target domain based on the causal features, which can observe improved generalization ability. Extensive experiments under three cross-domain tasks indicate that CPCA is remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Recently, learning open-vocabulary semantic segmentation from text supervision has achieved promising downstream performance. Nevertheless, current approaches encounter an alignment granularity gap owing to the absence of dense annotations, wherein they learn coarse image/region-text alignment during training yet perform group/pixel-level predictions at inference. Such discrepancy leads to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior zero-shot segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Grained Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework, which explicitly learns pixel-level alignment along with object- and region-level alignment to bridge the granularity gap without any dense annotations. Specifically, MGCA ingeniously constructs pseudo multi-granular semantic correspondences upon image-text pairs and collaborates with hard sampling strategies to facilitate fine-grained cross-modal contrastive learning. Further, we point out the defects of existing group and pixel prediction units in downstream segmentation and develop an adaptive semantic unit which effectively mitigates their dilemmas including under- and over-segmentation. Training solely on CC3M, our method achieves significant advancements over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Zero-shot image captioning (IC) without well-paired image-text data can be divided into two categories, training-free and text-only-training. Generally, these two types of methods realize zero-shot IC by integrating pretrained vision-language models like CLIP for image-text similarity evaluation and a pre-trained language model (LM) for caption generation. The main difference between them is whether using a textual corpus to train the LM. Though achieving attractive performance w.r.t. some metrics, existing methods often exhibit some common drawbacks. Training-free methods tend to produce hallucinations, while text-only-training often lose generalization capability. To move forward, in this paper, we propose a novel Memory-Augmented zero-shot image Captioning framework (MeaCap). Specifically, equipped with a textual memory, we introduce a retrieve-then-filter module to get key concepts that are highly related to the image. By deploying our proposed memory-augmented visual-related fusion score in a keywords-to-sentence LM, MeaCap can generate concept-centered captions that keep high consistency with the image with fewer hallucinations and more world-knowledge. The framework of MeaCap achieves the state-of-the-art performance on a series of zero-shot IC settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/joeyz0z/MeaCap.

- **Summary**: This work explores a closure task in comics, a medium where visual and textual elements are intricately intertwined. Specifically, Text-cloze refers to the task of selecting the correct text to use in a comic panel, given its neighboring panels. Traditional methods based on recurrent neural networks have struggled with this task due to limited OCR accuracy and inherent model limitations. We introduce a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (Multimodal-LLM) architecture, specifically designed for Text-cloze, achieving a 10% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models in both its easy and hard variants. Central to our approach is a Domain-Adapted ResNet-50 based visual encoder, fine-tuned to the comics domain in a self-supervised manner using SimCLR. This encoder delivers comparable results to more complex models with just one-fifth of the parameters. Additionally, we release new OCR annotations for this dataset, enhancing model input quality and resulting in another 1% improvement. Finally, we extend the task to a generative format, establishing new baselines and expanding the research possibilities in the field of comics analysis.

- **Summary**: Recent LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection (3DOD) methods show promising results, but they often do not generalize well to target domains outside the source (or training) data distribution. To reduce such domain gaps and thus to make 3DOD models more generalizable, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, called CMDA, which (i) leverages visual semantic cues from an image modality (i.e., camera images) as an effective semantic bridge to close the domain gap in the cross-modal Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Further, (ii) we also introduce a self-training-based learning strategy, wherein a model is adversarially trained to generate domain-invariant features, which disrupt the discrimination of whether a feature instance comes from a source or an unseen target domain. Overall, our CMDA framework guides the 3DOD model to generate highly informative and domain-adaptive features for novel data distributions. In our extensive experiments with large-scale benchmarks, such as nuScenes, Waymo, and KITTI, those mentioned above provide significant performance gains for UDA tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the integration of diversity-based and uncertainty-based sampling strategies in active learning, particularly within the context of self-supervised pre-trained models. We introduce a straightforward heuristic called TCM that mitigates the cold start problem while maintaining strong performance across various data levels. By initially applying TypiClust for diversity sampling and subsequently transitioning to uncertainty sampling with Margin, our approach effectively combines the strengths of both strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that TCM consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets in both low and high data regimes.

- **Summary**: As part of human core knowledge, the representation of objects is the building block of mental representation that supports high-level concepts and symbolic reasoning. While humans develop the ability of perceiving objects situated in 3D environments without supervision, models that learn the same set of abilities with similar constraints faced by human infants are lacking. Towards this end, we developed a novel network architecture that simultaneously learns to 1) segment objects from discrete images, 2) infer their 3D locations, and 3) perceive depth, all while using only information directly available to the brain as training data, namely: sequences of images and self-motion. The core idea is treating objects as latent causes of visual input which the brain uses to make efficient predictions of future scenes. This results in object representations being learned as an essential byproduct of learning to predict.

- **Summary**: Recent progress in generative compression technology has significantly improved the perceptual quality of compressed data. However, these advancements primarily focus on producing high-frequency details, often overlooking the ability of generative models to capture the prior distribution of image content, thus impeding further bitrate reduction in extreme compression scenarios (<0.05 bpp). Motivated by the capabilities of predictive language models for lossless compression, this paper introduces a novel Unified Image Generation-Compression (UIGC) paradigm, merging the processes of generation and compression. A key feature of the UIGC framework is the adoption of vector-quantized (VQ) image models for tokenization, alongside a multi-stage transformer designed to exploit spatial contextual information for modeling the prior distribution. As such, the dual-purpose framework effectively utilizes the learned prior for entropy estimation and assists in the regeneration of lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UIGC framework over existing codecs in perceptual quality and human perception, particularly in ultra-low bitrate scenarios (<=0.03 bpp), pioneering a new direction in generative compression.

- **Summary**: In the domain of image layout representation learning, the critical process of translating image layouts into succinct vector forms is increasingly significant across diverse applications, such as image retrieval, manipulation, and generation. Most approaches in this area heavily rely on costly labeled datasets and notably lack in adapting their modeling and learning methods to the specific nuances of photographic image layouts. This shortfall makes the learning process for photographic image layouts suboptimal. In our research, we directly address these challenges. We innovate by defining basic layout primitives that encapsulate various levels of layout information and by mapping these, along with their interconnections, onto a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is meticulously engineered to capture the intricate layout information within the pixel domain explicitly. Advancing further, we introduce novel pretext tasks coupled with customized loss functions, strategically designed for effective self-supervised learning of these layout graphs. Building on this foundation, we develop an autoencoder-based network architecture skilled in compressing these heterogeneous layout graphs into precise, dimensionally-reduced layout representations. Additionally, we introduce the LODB dataset, which features a broader range of layout categories and richer semantics, serving as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of layout representation learning methods. Our extensive experimentation on this dataset demonstrates the superior performance of our approach in the realm of photographic image layout representation learning.

- **Summary**: Active learning is a machine learning paradigm designed to optimize model performance in a setting where labeled data is expensive to acquire. In this work, we propose a novel active learning method called SUPClust that seeks to identify points at the decision boundary between classes. By targeting these points, SUPClust aims to gather information that is most informative for refining the model's prediction of complex decision regions. We demonstrate experimentally that labeling these points leads to strong model performance. This improvement is observed even in scenarios characterized by strong class imbalance.

- **Summary**: Quantification of lymphoid aggregates including tertiary lymphoid structures with germinal centers in histology images of cancer is a promising approach for developing prognostic and predictive tissue biomarkers. In this article, we provide recommendations for identifying lymphoid aggregates in tissue sections from routine pathology workflows such as hematoxylin and eosin staining. To overcome the intrinsic variability associated with manual image analysis (such as subjective decision making, attention span), we recently developed a deep learning-based algorithm called HookNet-TLS to detect lymphoid aggregates and germinal centers in various tissues. Here, we additionally provide a guideline for using manually annotated images for training and implementing HookNet-TLS for automated and objective quantification of lymphoid aggregates in various cancer types.

- **Summary**: Ship detection needs to identify ship locations from remote sensing (RS) scenes. However, due to different imaging payloads, various appearances of ships, and complicated background interference from the bird's eye view, it is difficult to set up a unified paradigm for achieving multi-source ship detection. Therefore, in this article, considering that the large language models (LLMs) emerge the powerful generalization ability, a novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection from RS imagery. First, to bridge the interpretation gap between multi-source images for ship detection, a novel image-instruction-answer way is designed to integrate the various ship detection ways (e.g., horizontal bounding box (HBB), oriented bounding box (OBB)) into a unified labeling paradigm. Then, in view of this, a cross-modal image interpretation method is developed for the proposed Popeye to enhance interactive comprehension ability between visual and language content, which can be easily migrated into any multi-source ship detection task. Subsequently, owing to objective domain differences, a knowledge adaption mechanism is designed to adapt the pre-trained visual-language knowledge from the nature scene into the RS domain for multi-source ship detection. In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) is also seamlessly integrated into the proposed Popeye to achieve pixel-level ship segmentation without additional training costs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the newly constructed instruction dataset named MMShip, and the results indicate that the proposed Popeye outperforms current specialist, open-vocabulary, and other visual-language models for zero-shot multi-source ship detection.

- **Summary**: We propose a method for autonomous precision drone landing with fiducial markers and a gimbal-mounted, multi-payload camera with wide-angle, zoom, and IR sensors. The method has minimal data requirements; it depends primarily on the direction from the drone to the landing pad, enabling it to switch dynamically between the camera's different sensors and zoom factors, and minimizing auxiliary sensor requirements. It eliminates the need for data such as altitude above ground level, straight-line distance to the landing pad, fiducial marker size, and 6 DoF marker pose (of which the orientation is problematic). We leverage the zoom and wide-angle cameras, as well as visual April Tag fiducial markers to conduct successful precision landings from much longer distances than in previous work (168m horizontal distance, 102m altitude). We use two types of April Tags in the IR spectrum - active and passive - for precision landing both at daytime and nighttime, instead of simple IR beacons used in most previous work. The active IR landing pad is heated; the novel, passive one is unpowered, at ambient temperature, and depends on its high reflectivity and an IR differential between the ground and the sky. Finally, we propose a high-level control policy to manage initial search for the landing pad and subsequent searches if it is lost - not addressed in previous work. The method demonstrates successful landings with the landing skids at least touching the landing pad, achieving an average error of 0.19m. It also demonstrates successful recovery and landing when the landing pad is temporarily obscured.

- **Summary**: Floating Car Observers (FCOs) are an innovative method to collect traffic data by deploying sensor-equipped vehicles to detect and locate other vehicles. We demonstrate that even a small penetration rate of FCOs can identify a significant amount of vehicles at a given intersection. This is achieved through the emulation of detection within a microscopic traffic simulation. Additionally, leveraging data from previous moments can enhance the detection of vehicles in the current frame. Our findings indicate that, with a 20-second observation window, it is possible to recover up to 20\% of vehicles that are not visible by FCOs in the current timestep. To exploit this, we developed a data-driven strategy, utilizing sequences of Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations of detected vehicles and deep learning models. This approach aims to bring currently undetected vehicles into view in the present moment, enhancing the currently detected vehicles. Results of different spatiotemporal architectures show that up to 41\% of the vehicles can be recovered into the current timestep at their current position. This enhancement enriches the information initially available by the FCO, allowing an improved estimation of traffic states and metrics (e.g. density and queue length) for improved implementation of traffic management strategies.

- **Summary**: Medical image classification is a very fundamental and crucial task in the field of computer vision. These years, CNN-based and Transformer-based models are widely used in classifying various medical images. Unfortunately, The limitation of CNNs in long-range modeling capabilities prevent them from effectively extracting fine-grained features in medical images , while Transformers are hampered by their quadratic computational complexity. Recent research has shown that the state space model (SSM) represented by Mamba can efficiently model long-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by this, we propose Vision Mamba for medical image classification (MedMamba). More specifically, we introduce a novel Conv-SSM module, which combines the local feature extraction ability of convolutional layers with the ability of SSM to capture long-range dependency. To demonstrate the potential of MedMamba, we conduct extensive experiments using three publicly available medical datasets with different imaging techniques (i.e., Kvasir (endoscopic images), FETAL_PLANES_DB (ultrasound images) and Covid19-Pneumonia-Normal Chest X-Ray (X-ray images)) and two private datasets built by ourselves. Experimental results show that the proposed MedMamba performs well in detecting lesions in various medical images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Vision Mamba tailored for medical image classification. The purpose of this work is to establish a new baseline for medical image classification tasks and provide valuable insights for the future development of more efficient and effective SSM-based artificial intelligence algorithms and application systems in the medical.

- **Summary**: We consider unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation in which the model is trained on a labeled source dataset and adapted to an unlabeled target dataset. Unfortunately, current self-training methods are susceptible to misclassified pseudo-labels resulting from erroneous predictions. Since certain classes are typically associated with less reliable predictions in UDA, reducing the impact of such pseudo-labels without skewing the training towards some classes is notoriously difficult. To this end, we propose an extensive cut-and-paste strategy (ECAP) to leverage reliable pseudo-labels through data augmentation. Specifically, ECAP maintains a memory bank of pseudo-labeled target samples throughout training and cut-and-pastes the most confident ones onto the current training batch. We implement ECAP on top of the recent method MIC and boost its performance on two synthetic-to-real domain adaptation benchmarks. Notably, MIC+ECAP reaches an unprecedented performance of 69.1 mIoU on the Synthia->Cityscapes benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/ErikBrorsson/ECAP.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the novel task of multimodal puzzle solving, framed within the context of visual question-answering. We present a new dataset, AlgoPuzzleVQA designed to challenge and evaluate the capabilities of multimodal language models in solving algorithmic puzzles that necessitate both visual understanding, language understanding, and complex algorithmic reasoning. We create the puzzles to encompass a diverse array of mathematical and algorithmic topics such as boolean logic, combinatorics, graph theory, optimization, search, etc., aiming to evaluate the gap between visual data interpretation and algorithmic problem-solving skills. The dataset is generated automatically from code authored by humans. All our puzzles have exact solutions that can be found from the algorithm without tedious human calculations. It ensures that our dataset can be scaled up arbitrarily in terms of reasoning complexity and dataset size. Our investigation reveals that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4V and Gemini exhibit limited performance in puzzle-solving tasks. We find that their performance is near random in a multi-choice question-answering setup for a significant number of puzzles. The findings emphasize the challenges of integrating visual, language, and algorithmic knowledge for solving complex reasoning problems.

- **Summary**: Bladder cancer ranks within the top 10 most diagnosed cancers worldwide and is among the most expensive cancers to treat due to the high recurrence rates which require lifetime follow-ups. The primary tool for diagnosis is cystoscopy, which heavily relies on doctors' expertise and interpretation. Therefore, annually, numerous cases are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and treated as urinary infections. To address this, we suggest a deep learning approach for bladder cancer detection and segmentation which combines CNNs with a lightweight positional-encoding-free transformer and dual attention gates that fuse self and spatial attention for feature enhancement. The architecture suggested in this paper is efficient making it suitable for medical scenarios that require real time inference. Experiments have proven that this model addresses the critical need for a balance between computational efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in cystoscopic imaging as despite its small size it rivals large models in performance.

- **Summary**: The efficacy of machine learning has traditionally relied on the availability of increasingly larger datasets. However, large datasets pose storage challenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during training without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to these limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into a condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged. One crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking the original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if the employed model architecture differs from the model used during distillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images, e.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with dataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel diffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the gradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the trade-off between speed and accuracy. We evaluate our approach in several ImageNet subsets and for high-resolution images (128x128 and 256x256). As a result, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation techniques by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively.

- **Summary**: Accurate training labels are a key component for multi-class medical image segmentation. Their annotation is costly and time-consuming because it requires domain expertise. This work aims to develop a dual-branch network and automatically improve training labels for multi-class image segmentation. Transfer learning is used to train the network and improve inaccurate weak labels sequentially. The dual-branch network is first trained by weak labels alone to initialize model parameters. After the network is stabilized, the shared encoder is frozen, and strong and weak decoders are fine-tuned by strong and weak labels together. The accuracy of weak labels is iteratively improved in the fine-tuning process. The proposed method was applied to a three-class segmentation of muscle, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue on abdominal CT scans. Validation results on 11 patients showed that the accuracy of training labels was statistically significantly improved, with the Dice similarity coefficient of muscle, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue increased from 74.2% to 91.5%, 91.2% to 95.6%, and 77.6% to 88.5%, respectively (p<0.05). In comparison with our earlier method, the label accuracy was also significantly improved (p<0.05). These experimental results suggested that the combination of the dual-branch network and transfer learning is an efficient means to improve training labels for multi-class segmentation.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (HDP), a hierarchical agent for multi-task robotic manipulation. HDP factorises a manipulation policy into a hierarchical structure: a high-level task-planning agent which predicts a distant next-best end-effector pose (NBP), and a low-level goal-conditioned diffusion policy which generates optimal motion trajectories. The factorised policy representation allows HDP to tackle both long-horizon task planning while generating fine-grained low-level actions. To generate context-aware motion trajectories while satisfying robot kinematics constraints, we present a novel kinematics-aware goal-conditioned control agent, Robot Kinematics Diffuser (RK-Diffuser). Specifically, RK-Diffuser learns to generate both the end-effector pose and joint position trajectories, and distill the accurate but kinematics-unaware end-effector pose diffuser to the kinematics-aware but less accurate joint position diffuser via differentiable kinematics. Empirically, we show that HDP achieves a significantly higher success rate than the state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real-world.

- **Summary**: Deep Learning (DL) can predict biomarkers directly from digitized cancer histology in a weakly-supervised setting. Recently, the prediction of continuous biomarkers through regression-based DL has seen an increasing interest. Nonetheless, clinical decision making often requires a categorical outcome. Consequently, we developed a weakly-supervised joint multi-task Transformer architecture which has been trained and evaluated on four public patient cohorts for the prediction of two key predictive biomarkers, microsatellite instability (MSI) and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), trained with auxiliary regression tasks related to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive benchmark of 16 approaches of task balancing for weakly-supervised joint multi-task learning in computational pathology. Using our novel approach, we improve over the state-of-the-art area under the receiver operating characteristic by +7.7% and +4.1%, as well as yielding better clustering of latent embeddings by +8% and +5% for the prediction of MSI and HRD in external cohorts, respectively.

- **Summary**: Simulation is an invaluable tool for radio-frequency system designers that enables rapid prototyping of various algorithms for imaging, target detection, classification, and tracking. However, simulating realistic radar scans is a challenging task that requires an accurate model of the scene, radio frequency material properties, and a corresponding radar synthesis function. Rather than specifying these models explicitly, we propose DART - Doppler Aided Radar Tomography, a Neural Radiance Field-inspired method which uses radar-specific physics to create a reflectance and transmittance-based rendering pipeline for range-Doppler images. We then evaluate DART by constructing a custom data collection platform and collecting a novel radar dataset together with accurate position and instantaneous velocity measurements from lidar-based localization. In comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, DART synthesizes superior radar range-Doppler images from novel views across all datasets and additionally can be used to generate high quality tomographic images.

- **Summary**: Imitation learning provides an efficient way to teach robots dexterous skills; however, learning complex skills robustly and generalizablely usually consumes large amounts of human demonstrations. To tackle this challenging problem, we present 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), a novel visual imitation learning approach that incorporates the power of 3D visual representations into diffusion policies, a class of conditional action generative models. The core design of DP3 is the utilization of a compact 3D visual representation, extracted from sparse point clouds with an efficient point encoder. In our experiments involving 72 simulation tasks, DP3 successfully handles most tasks with just 10 demonstrations and surpasses baselines with a 55.3% relative improvement. In 4 real robot tasks, DP3 demonstrates precise control with a high success rate of 85%, given only 40 demonstrations of each task, and shows excellent generalization abilities in diverse aspects, including space, viewpoint, appearance, and instance. Interestingly, in real robot experiments, DP3 rarely violates safety requirements, in contrast to baseline methods which frequently do, necessitating human intervention. Our extensive evaluation highlights the critical importance of 3D representations in real-world robot learning. Videos, code, and data are available on https://3d-diffusion-policy.github.io .



### Video Relationship Detection Using Mixture of Experts

- **Summary**: Machine comprehension of visual information from images and videos by neural networks faces two primary challenges. Firstly, there exists a computational and inference gap in connecting vision and language, making it difficult to accurately determine which object a given agent acts on and represent it through language. Secondly, classifiers trained by a single, monolithic neural network often lack stability and generalization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoE-VRD, a novel approach to visual relationship detection utilizing a mixture of experts. MoE-VRD identifies language triplets in the form of < subject, predicate, object> tuples to extract relationships from visual processing. Leveraging recent advancements in visual relationship detection, MoE-VRD addresses the requirement for action recognition in establishing relationships between subjects (acting) and objects (being acted upon). In contrast to single monolithic networks, MoE-VRD employs multiple small models as experts, whose outputs are aggregated. Each expert in MoE-VRD specializes in visual relationship learning and object tagging. By utilizing a sparsely-gated mixture of experts, MoE-VRD enables conditional computation and significantly enhances neural network capacity without increasing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conditional computation capabilities and scalability of the mixture-of-experts approach lead to superior performance in visual relationship detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis, rule-based systems are usually employed to extract labels from reports, but concerns exist about label quality. These datasets typically offer only presence labels, sometimes with binary uncertainty indicators, which limits their usefulness. In this work, we present MAPLEZ (Medical report Annotations with Privacy-preserving Large language model using Expeditious Zero shot answers), a novel approach leveraging a locally executable Large Language Model (LLM) to extract and enhance findings labels on CXR reports. MAPLEZ extracts not only binary labels indicating the presence or absence of a finding but also the location, severity, and radiologists' uncertainty about the finding. Over eight abnormalities from five test sets, we show that our method can extract these annotations with an increase of 5 percentage points (pp) in F1 score for categorical presence annotations and more than 30 pp increase in F1 score for the location annotations over competing labelers. Additionally, using these improved annotations in classification supervision, we demonstrate substantial advancements in model quality, with an increase of 1.7 pp in AUROC over models trained with annotations from the state-of-the-art approach. We share code and annotations.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised contrastive learning strategy has attracted remarkable attention due to its exceptional ability in representation learning. However, current contrastive learning tends to learn global coarse-grained representations of the image that benefit generic object recognition, whereas such coarse-grained features are insufficient for fine-grained visual recognition. In this paper, we present to incorporate the subtle local fine-grained feature learning into global self-supervised contrastive learning through a pure self-supervised global-local fine-grained contrastive learning framework. Specifically, a novel pretext task called Local Discrimination (LoDisc) is proposed to explicitly supervise self-supervised model's focus towards local pivotal regions which are captured by a simple-but-effective location-wise mask sampling strategy. We show that Local Discrimination pretext task can effectively enhance fine-grained clues in important local regions, and the global-local framework further refines the fine-grained feature representations of images. Extensive experimental results on different fine-grained object recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a decent improvement in different evaluation settings. Meanwhile, the proposed method is also effective in general object recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: Adversarial Training (AT) effectively improves the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks. Generally, AT involves training DNN models with adversarial examples obtained within a pre-defined, fixed perturbation bound. Notably, individual natural examples from which these adversarial examples are crafted exhibit varying degrees of intrinsic vulnerabilities, and as such, crafting adversarial examples with fixed perturbation radius for all instances may not sufficiently unleash the potency of AT. Motivated by this observation, we propose two simple, computationally cheap vulnerability-aware reweighting functions for assigning perturbation bounds to adversarial examples used for AT, named Margin-Weighted Perturbation Budget (MWPB) and Standard-Deviation-Weighted Perturbation Budget (SDWPB). The proposed methods assign perturbation radii to individual adversarial samples based on the vulnerability of their corresponding natural examples. Experimental results show that the proposed methods yield genuine improvements in the robustness of AT algorithms against various adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a novel multi-modal Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) algorithm for self-driving cars that combines camera and LiDAR data. Camera frames are processed with a state-of-the-art 3D object detector, whereas classical clustering techniques are used to process LiDAR observations. The proposed MOT algorithm comprises a three-step association process, an Extended Kalman filter for estimating the motion of each detected dynamic obstacle, and a track management phase. The EKF motion model requires the current measured relative position and orientation of the observed object and the longitudinal and angular velocities of the ego vehicle as inputs. Unlike most state-of-the-art multi-modal MOT approaches, the proposed algorithm does not rely on maps or knowledge of the ego global pose. Moreover, it uses a 3D detector exclusively for cameras and is agnostic to the type of LiDAR sensor used. The algorithm is validated both in simulation and with real-world data, with satisfactory results.

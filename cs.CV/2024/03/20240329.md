- **Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving has garnered significant attention as a key research area within artificial intelligence. In the context of autonomous driving scenarios, the varying physical locations of objects correspond to different levels of danger. However, conventional evaluation criteria for automatic driving object detection often overlook the crucial aspect of an object's physical location, leading to evaluation results that may not accurately reflect the genuine threat posed by the object to the autonomous driving vehicle. To enhance the safety of autonomous driving, this paper introduces a novel evaluation criterion based on physical location information, termed PLoc. This criterion transcends the limitations of traditional criteria by acknowledging that the physical location of pedestrians in autonomous driving scenarios can provide valuable safety-related information. Furthermore, this paper presents a newly re-annotated dataset (ApolloScape-R) derived from ApolloScape. ApolloScape-R involves the relabeling of pedestrians based on the significance of their physical location. The dataset is utilized to assess the performance of various object detection models under the proposed PLoc criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy of all object detection models in identifying a person situated in the travel lane of an autonomous vehicle is lower than that for a person on a sidewalk. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/lnyrlyed/ApolloScape-R.git

- **Summary**: A simply implemented activation function with even cubic nonlinearity is introduced that increases the accuracy of neural networks without substantial additional computational resources. This is partially enabled through an apparent tradeoff between convergence and accuracy. The activation function generalizes the standard RELU function by introducing additional degrees of freedom through optimizable parameters that enable the degree of nonlinearity to be adjusted. The associated accuracy enhancement is quantified in the context of the MNIST digit data set through a comparison with standard techniques.

- **Summary**: Achieving an effective fine-grained appearance variation over 2D facial images, whilst preserving facial identity, is a challenging task due to the high complexity and entanglement of common 2D facial feature encoding spaces. Despite these challenges, such fine-grained control, by way of disentanglement is a crucial enabler for data-driven racial bias mitigation strategies across multiple automated facial analysis tasks, as it allows to analyse, characterise and synthesise human facial diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework to enable fine-grained control over individual race-related phenotype attributes of the facial images. Our framework factors the latent (feature) space into elements that correspond to race-related facial phenotype representations, thereby separating phenotype aspects (e.g. skin, hair colour, nose, eye, mouth shapes), which are notoriously difficult to annotate robustly in real-world facial data. Concurrently, we also introduce a high quality augmented, diverse 2D face image dataset drawn from CelebA-HQ for GAN training. Unlike prior work, our framework only relies upon 2D imagery and related parameters to achieve state-of-the-art individual control over race-related phenotype attributes with improved photo-realistic output.

- **Summary**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models for image inpainting aim to add the noise to the texture of image during the forward process and recover masked regions with unmasked ones of the texture via the reverse denoising process. Despite the meaningful semantics generation, the existing arts suffer from the semantic discrepancy between masked and unmasked regions, since the semantically dense unmasked texture fails to be completely degraded while the masked regions turn to the pure noise in diffusion process, leading to the large discrepancy between them. In this paper, we aim to answer how unmasked semantics guide texture denoising process;together with how to tackle the semantic discrepancy, to facilitate the consistent and meaningful semantics generation. To this end, we propose a novel structure-guided diffusion model named StrDiffusion, to reformulate the conventional texture denoising process under structure guidance to derive a simplified denoising objective for image inpainting, while revealing: 1) the semantically sparse structure is beneficial to tackle semantic discrepancy in early stage, while dense texture generates reasonable semantics in late stage; 2) the semantics from unmasked regions essentially offer the time-dependent structure guidance for the texture denoising process, benefiting from the time-dependent sparsity of the structure semantics. For the denoising process, a structure-guided neural network is trained to estimate the simplified denoising objective by exploiting the consistency of the denoised structure between masked and unmasked regions. Besides, we devise an adaptive resampling strategy as a formal criterion as whether structure is competent to guide the texture denoising process, while regulate their semantic correlations. Extensive experiments validate the merits of StrDiffusion over the state-of-the-arts. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/StrDiffusion.

- **Summary**: Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image interpretation is widely used in various fields. Recently, deep learning has made significant progress in PolSAR image classification. Supervised learning (SL) requires a large amount of labeled PolSAR data with high quality to achieve better performance, however, manually labeled data is insufficient. This causes the SL to fail into overfitting and degrades its generalization performance. Furthermore, the scattering confusion problem is also a significant challenge that attracts more attention. To solve these problems, this article proposes a Heterogeneous Network based Contrastive Learning method(HCLNet). It aims to learn high-level representation from unlabeled PolSAR data for few-shot classification according to multi-features and superpixels. Beyond the conventional CL, HCLNet introduces the heterogeneous architecture for the first time to utilize heterogeneous PolSAR features better. And it develops two easy-to-use plugins to narrow the domain gap between optics and PolSAR, including feature filter and superpixel-based instance discrimination, which the former is used to enhance the complementarity of multi-features, and the latter is used to increase the diversity of negative samples. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of HCLNet on three widely used PolSAR benchmark datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies also verify the importance of each component. Besides, this work has implications for how to efficiently utilize the multi-features of PolSAR data to learn better high-level representation in CL and how to construct networks suitable for PolSAR data better.

- **Summary**: We introduce a lightweight and accurate localization method that only utilizes the geometry of 2D-3D lines. Given a pre-captured 3D map, our approach localizes a panorama image, taking advantage of the holistic 360 view. The system mitigates potential privacy breaches or domain discrepancies by avoiding trained or hand-crafted visual descriptors. However, as lines alone can be ambiguous, we express distinctive yet compact spatial contexts from relationships between lines, namely the dominant directions of parallel lines and the intersection between non-parallel lines. The resulting representations are efficient in processing time and memory compared to conventional visual descriptor-based methods. Given the groups of dominant line directions and their intersections, we accelerate the search process to test thousands of pose candidates in less than a millisecond without sacrificing accuracy. We empirically show that the proposed 2D-3D matching can localize panoramas for challenging scenes with similar structures, dramatic domain shifts or illumination changes. Our fully geometric approach does not involve extensive parameter tuning or neural network training, making it a practical algorithm that can be readily deployed in the real world.

- **Summary**: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) stands as the leading cause of blindness globally, particularly affecting individuals between the ages of 20 and 70. This paper presents a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system designed for the automatic classification of retinal images into five distinct classes: Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). The proposed system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) employing pre-trained deep learning models. Through the application of fine-tuning techniques, our model is trained on fundus images of diabetic retinopathy with resolutions of 350x350x3 and 224x224x3. Experimental results obtained on the Kaggle platform, utilizing resources comprising 4 CPUs, 17 GB RAM, and 1 GB Disk, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The achieved Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for CNN, MobileNet, VGG-16, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 models are 0.50, 0.70, 0.53, 0.63, and 0.69, respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper details an innovative methodology to integrate image data into traditional econometric models. Motivated by forecasting sales prices for residential real estate, we harness the power of deep learning to add "information" contained in images as covariates. Specifically, images of homes were categorized and encoded using an ensemble of image classifiers (ResNet-50, VGG16, MobileNet, and Inception V3). Unique features presented within each image were further encoded through panoptic segmentation. Forecasts from a neural network trained on the encoded data results in improved out-of-sample predictive power. We also combine these image-based forecasts with standard hedonic real estate property and location characteristics, resulting in a unified dataset. We show that image-based forecasts increase the accuracy of hedonic forecasts when encoded features are regarded as additional covariates. We also attempt to "explain" which covariates the image-based forecasts are most highly correlated with. The study exemplifies the benefits of interdisciplinary methodologies, merging machine learning and econometrics to harness untapped data sources for more accurate forecasting.

- **Summary**: Establishing reliable correspondences is essential for registration tasks such as 3D and 2D3D registration. Existing methods commonly leverage geometric or semantic point features to generate potential correspondences. However, these features may face challenges such as large deformation, scale inconsistency, and ambiguous matching problems (e.g., symmetry). Additionally, many previous methods, which rely on single-pass prediction, may struggle with local minima in complex scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a diffusion matching model for robust correspondence construction. Our approach treats correspondence estimation as a denoising diffusion process within the doubly stochastic matrix space, which gradually denoises (refines) a doubly stochastic matching matrix to the ground-truth one for high-quality correspondence estimation. It involves a forward diffusion process that gradually introduces Gaussian noise into the ground truth matching matrix and a reverse denoising process that iteratively refines the noisy matching matrix. In particular, the feature extraction from the backbone occurs only once during the inference phase. Our lightweight denoising module utilizes the same feature at each reverse sampling step. Evaluation of our method on both 3D and 2D3D registration tasks confirms its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: In this work, we introduce a method that learns a single dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) from monocular talking face videos of multiple identities. NeRFs have shown remarkable results in modeling the 4D dynamics and appearance of human faces. However, they require per-identity optimization. Although recent approaches have proposed techniques to reduce the training and rendering time, increasing the number of identities can be expensive. We introduce MI-NeRF (multi-identity NeRF), a single unified network that models complex non-rigid facial motion for multiple identities, using only monocular videos of arbitrary length. The core premise in our method is to learn the non-linear interactions between identity and non-identity specific information with a multiplicative module. By training on multiple videos simultaneously, MI-NeRF not only reduces the total training time compared to standard single-identity NeRFs, but also demonstrates robustness in synthesizing novel expressions for any input identity. We present results for both facial expression transfer and talking face video synthesis. Our method can be further personalized for a target identity given only a short video.

- **Summary**: Considering the complementarity of scene flow estimation in the spatial domain's focusing capability and 3D object tracking in the temporal domain's coherence, this study aims to address a comprehensive new task that can simultaneously capture fine-grained and long-term 3D motion in an online manner: long-term scene flow estimation (LSFE). We introduce SceneTracker, a novel learning-based LSFE network that adopts an iterative approach to approximate the optimal trajectory. Besides, it dynamically indexes and constructs appearance and depth correlation features simultaneously and employs the Transformer to explore and utilize long-range connections within and between trajectories. With detailed experiments, SceneTracker shows superior capabilities in handling 3D spatial occlusion and depth noise interference, highly tailored to the LSFE task's needs. The code for SceneTracker is available at https://github.com/wwsource/SceneTracker.

- **Summary**: By leveraging temporal dependency in video sequences, multi-frame human pose estimation algorithms have demonstrated remarkable results in complicated situations, such as occlusion, motion blur, and video defocus. These algorithms are predominantly based on heatmaps, resulting in high computation and storage requirements per frame, which limits their flexibility and real-time application in video scenarios, particularly on edge devices. In this paper, we develop an efficient and effective video-based human pose regression method, which bypasses intermediate representations such as heatmaps and instead directly maps the input to the output joint coordinates. Despite the inherent spatial correlation among adjacent joints of the human pose, the temporal trajectory of each individual joint exhibits relative independence. In light of this, we propose a novel Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation network (DSTA) to separately capture the spatial contexts between adjacent joints and the temporal cues of each individual joint, thereby avoiding the conflation of spatiotemporal dimensions. Concretely, DSTA learns a dedicated feature token for each joint to facilitate the modeling of their spatiotemporal dependencies. With the proposed joint-wise local-awareness attention mechanism, our method is capable of efficiently and flexibly utilizing the spatial dependency of adjacent joints and the temporal dependency of each joint itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to previous regression-based single-frame human pose estimation methods, DSTA significantly enhances performance, achieving an 8.9 mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017. Furthermore, our approach either surpasses or is on par with the state-of-the-art heatmap-based multi-frame human pose estimation methods. Project page: https://github.com/zgspose/DSTA.

- **Summary**: In computer vision, characteristics refer to image regions with unique properties, such as corners, edges, textures, or areas with high contrast. These regions can be represented through feature points (FPs). FP detection and description are fundamental steps to many computer vision tasks. Most FP detection and description methods use low dynamic range (LDR) images, sufficient for most applications involving digital images. However, LDR images may have saturated pixels in scenes with extreme light conditions, which degrade FP detection. On the other hand, high dynamic range (HDR) images usually present a greater dynamic range but FP detection algorithms do not take advantage of all the information in such images. In this study, we present a systematic review of image detection and description algorithms that use HDR images as input. We developed a library called CP_HDR that implements the Harris corner detector, SIFT detector and descriptor, and two modifications of those algorithms specialized in HDR images, called SIFT for HDR (SfHDR) and Harris for HDR (HfHDR). Previous studies investigated the use of HDR images in FP detection, but we did not find studies investigating the use of HDR images in FP description. Using uniformity, repeatability rate, mean average precision, and matching rate metrics, we compared the performance of the CP_HDR algorithms using LDR and HDR images. We observed an increase in the uniformity of the distribution of FPs among the high-light, mid-light, and low-light areas of the images. The results show that using HDR images as input to detection algorithms improves performance and that SfHDR and HfHDR enhance FP description.

- **Summary**: Recently, deep neural networks have achieved excellent performance on low-light raw video enhancement. However, they often come with high computational complexity and large memory costs, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the extremely compact binary neural network (BNN) to low-light raw video enhancement. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing video enhancement models. One is how to fuse the temporal information to improve low-light denoising without complex modules. The other is how to narrow the performance gap between binary convolutions with the full precision ones. To address the first issue, we introduce a spatial-temporal shift operation, which is easy-to-binarize and effective. The temporal shift efficiently aggregates the features of neighbor frames and the spatial shift handles the misalignment caused by the large motion in videos. For the second issue, we present a distribution-aware binary convolution, which captures the distribution characteristics of real-valued input and incorporates them into plain binary convolutions to alleviate the degradation in performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized low-light raw video enhancement method can attain a promising performance.

- **Summary**: Fairness is a critical concern in deep learning, especially in healthcare, where these models influence diagnoses and treatment decisions. Although fairness has been investigated in the vision-only domain, the fairness of medical vision-language (VL) models remains unexplored due to the scarcity of medical VL datasets for studying fairness. To bridge this research gap, we introduce the first fair vision-language medical dataset FairVLMed that provides detailed demographic attributes, ground-truth labels, and clinical notes to facilitate an in-depth examination of fairness within VL foundation models. Using FairVLMed, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis of two widely-used VL models (CLIP and BLIP2), pre-trained on both natural and medical domains, across four different protected attributes. Our results highlight significant biases in all VL models, with Asian, Male, Non-Hispanic, and Spanish being the preferred subgroups across the protected attributes of race, gender, ethnicity, and language, respectively. In order to alleviate these biases, we propose FairCLIP, an optimal-transport-based approach that achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and fairness by reducing the Sinkhorn distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group. As the first VL dataset of its kind, FairVLMed holds the potential to catalyze advancements in the development of machine learning models that are both ethically aware and clinically effective.

- **Summary**: In this work, we present efficient modulation, a novel design for efficient vision networks. We revisit the modulation mechanism, which operates input through convolutional context modeling and feature projection layers, and fuses features via element-wise multiplication and an MLP block. We demonstrate that the modulation mechanism is particularly well suited for efficient networks and further tailor the modulation design by proposing the efficient modulation (EfficientMod) block, which is considered the essential building block for our networks. Benefiting from the prominent representational ability of modulation mechanism and the proposed efficient design, our network can accomplish better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency and set new state-of-the-art performance in the zoo of efficient networks. When integrating EfficientMod with the vanilla self-attention block, we obtain the hybrid architecture which further improves the performance without loss of efficiency. We carry out comprehensive experiments to verify EfficientMod's performance. With fewer parameters, our EfficientMod-s performs 0.6 top-1 accuracy better than EfficientFormerV2-s2 and is 25% faster on GPU, and 2.9 better than MobileViTv2-1.0 at the same GPU latency. Additionally, our method presents a notable improvement in downstream tasks, outperforming EfficientFormerV2-s by 3.6 mIoU on the ADE20K benchmark.

- **Summary**: Existing text-to-image generative models reflect or even amplify societal biases ingrained in their training data. This is especially concerning for human image generation where models are biased against certain demographic groups. Existing attempts to rectify this issue are hindered by the inherent limitations of the pre-trained models and fail to substantially improve demographic diversity. In this work, we introduce Fair Retrieval Augmented Generation (FairRAG), a novel framework that conditions pre-trained generative models on reference images retrieved from an external image database to improve fairness in human generation. FairRAG enables conditioning through a lightweight linear module that projects reference images into the textual space. To enhance fairness, FairRAG applies simple-yet-effective debiasing strategies, providing images from diverse demographic groups during the generative process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairRAG outperforms existing methods in terms of demographic diversity, image-text alignment, and image fidelity while incurring minimal computational overhead during inference.

- **Summary**: Using single-task deep learning methods to reconstruct Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data acquired with different imaging sequences is inherently challenging. The trained deep learning model typically lacks generalizability, and the dissimilarity among image datasets with different types of contrast leads to suboptimal learning performance. This paper proposes a meta-learning approach to efficiently learn image features from multiple MR image datasets. Our algorithm can perform multi-task learning to simultaneously reconstruct MR images acquired using different imaging sequences with different image contrasts. The experiment results demonstrate the ability of our new meta-learning reconstruction method to successfully reconstruct highly-undersampled k-space data from multiple MRI datasets simultaneously, outperforming other compelling reconstruction methods previously developed for single-task learning.

- **Summary**: Recent studies have drawn attention to the untapped potential of the "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) in network design. While intuitive explanations abound, the foundational rationale behind its application remains largely unexplored. Our study attempts to reveal the star operation's ability to map inputs into high-dimensional, non-linear feature spaces -- akin to kernel tricks -- without widening the network. We further introduce StarNet, a simple yet powerful prototype, demonstrating impressive performance and low latency under compact network structure and efficient budget. Like stars in the sky, the star operation appears unremarkable but holds a vast universe of potential. Our work encourages further exploration across tasks, with codes available at https://github.com/ma-xu/Rewrite-the-Stars.

- **Summary**: Deep Neural Network (DNN) pruning has emerged as a key strategy to reduce model size, improve inference latency, and lower power consumption on DNN accelerators. Among various pruning techniques, block and output channel pruning have shown significant potential in accelerating hardware performance. However, their accuracy often requires further improvement. In response to this challenge, we introduce a separate, dynamic and differentiable (SMART) pruner. This pruner stands out by utilizing a separate, learnable probability mask for weight importance ranking, employing a differentiable Top k operator to achieve target sparsity, and leveraging a dynamic temperature parameter trick to escape from non-sparse local minima. In our experiments, the SMART pruner consistently demonstrated its superiority over existing pruning methods across a wide range of tasks and models on block and output channel pruning. Additionally, we extend our testing to Transformer-based models in N:M pruning scenarios, where SMART pruner also yields state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its adaptability and robustness across various neural network architectures, and pruning types.

- **Summary**: Tracking by natural language specification (TNL) aims to consistently localize a target in a video sequence given a linguistic description in the initial frame. Existing methodologies perform language-based and template-based matching for target reasoning separately and merge the matching results from two sources, which suffer from tracking drift when language and visual templates miss-align with the dynamic target state and ambiguity in the later merging stage. To tackle the issues, we propose a joint multi-modal tracking framework with 1) a prompt modulation module to leverage the complementarity between temporal visual templates and language expressions, enabling precise and context-aware appearance and linguistic cues, and 2) a unified target decoding module to integrate the multi-modal reference cues and executes the integrated queries on the search image to predict the target location in an end-to-end manner directly. This design ensures spatio-temporal consistency by leveraging historical visual information and introduces an integrated solution, generating predictions in a single step. Extensive experiments conducted on TNL2K, OTB-Lang, LaSOT, and RefCOCOg validate the efficacy of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods for both tracking and grounding.

- **Summary**: Event cameras, with their high temporal and dynamic range and minimal memory usage, have found applications in various fields. However, their potential in static traffic monitoring remains largely unexplored. To facilitate this exploration, we present eTraM - a first-of-its-kind, fully event-based traffic monitoring dataset. eTraM offers 10 hr of data from different traffic scenarios in various lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive overview of real-world situations. Providing 2M bounding box annotations, it covers eight distinct classes of traffic participants, ranging from vehicles to pedestrians and micro-mobility. eTraM's utility has been assessed using state-of-the-art methods for traffic participant detection, including RVT, RED, and YOLOv8. We quantitatively evaluate the ability of event-based models to generalize on nighttime and unseen scenes. Our findings substantiate the compelling potential of leveraging event cameras for traffic monitoring, opening new avenues for research and application. eTraM is available at https://eventbasedvision.github.io/eTraM

- **Summary**: Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session. Our proposed method eliminates model expansion and avoids retaining any image samples. It surpasses previous pre-trained model-based CIL methods and demonstrates remarkable continual learning capabilities. Experimental results on five CIL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

- **Summary**: Cattle face recognition holds paramount significance in domains such as animal husbandry and behavioral research. Despite significant progress in confined environments, applying these accomplishments in wild settings remains challenging. Thus, we create the first large-scale cattle face recognition dataset, ICRWE, for wild environments. It encompasses 483 cattle and 9,816 high-resolution image samples. Each sample undergoes annotation for face features, light conditions, and face orientation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel parallel attention network, PANet. Comprising several cascaded Transformer modules, each module incorporates two parallel Position Attention Modules (PAM) and Feature Mapping Modules (FMM). PAM focuses on local and global features at each image position through parallel channel attention, and FMM captures intricate feature patterns through non-linear mappings. Experimental results indicate that PANet achieves a recognition accuracy of 88.03% on the ICRWE dataset, establishing itself as the current state-of-the-art approach.

- **Summary**: Because of the complicated mechanism of ankle injury, it is very difficult to diagnose ankle fracture in clinic. In order to simplify the process of fracture diagnosis, an automatic diagnosis model of ankle fracture was proposed. Firstly, a tibia-fibula segmentation network is proposed for the joint tibiofibular region of the ankle joint, and the corresponding segmentation dataset is established on the basis of fracture data. Secondly, the image registration method is used to register the bone segmentation mask with the normal bone mask. Finally, a semi-supervised classifier is constructed to make full use of a large number of unlabeled data to classify ankle fractures. Experiments show that the proposed method can segment fractures with fracture lines accurately and has better performance than the general method. At the same time, this method is superior to classification network in several indexes.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes an algorithm for synthesizing novel views under few-shot setup. The main concept is to develop a stable surface regularization technique called Annealing Signed Distance Function (ASDF), which anneals the surface in a coarse-to-fine manner to accelerate convergence speed. We observe that the Eikonal loss - which is a widely known geometric regularization - requires dense training signal to shape different level-sets of SDF, leading to low-fidelity results under few-shot training. In contrast, the proposed surface regularization successfully reconstructs scenes and produce high-fidelity geometry with stable training. Our method is further accelerated by utilizing grid representation and monocular geometric priors. Finally, the proposed approach is up to 45 times faster than existing few-shot novel view synthesis methods, and it produces comparable results in the ScanNet dataset and NeRF-Real dataset.

- **Summary**: Many contemporary studies utilize grid-based models for neural field representation, but a systematic analysis of grid-based models is still missing, hindering the improvement of those models. Therefore, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for grid-based models. This framework points out that these models' approximation and generalization behaviors are determined by grid tangent kernels (GTK), which are intrinsic properties of grid-based models. The proposed framework facilitates a consistent and systematic analysis of diverse grid-based models. Furthermore, the introduced framework motivates the development of a novel grid-based model named the Multiplicative Fourier Adaptive Grid (MulFAGrid). The numerical analysis demonstrates that MulFAGrid exhibits a lower generalization bound than its predecessors, indicating its robust generalization performance. Empirical studies reveal that MulFAGrid achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, including 2D image fitting, 3D signed distance field (SDF) reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, demonstrating superior representation ability.

- **Summary**: Data augmentation is one of the regularization strategies for the training of deep learning models, which enhances generalizability and prevents overfitting, leading to performance improvement. Although researchers have proposed various data augmentation techniques, they often lack consideration for the difficulty of augmented data. Recently, another line of research suggests incorporating the concept of curriculum learning with data augmentation in the field of natural language processing. In this study, we adopt curriculum data augmentation for image data augmentation and propose colorful cutout, which gradually increases the noise and difficulty introduced in the augmented image. Our experimental results highlight the possibility of curriculum data augmentation for image data. We publicly released our source code to improve the reproducibility of our study.

- **Summary**: When capturing images through the glass during rainy or snowy weather conditions, the resulting images often contain waterdrops adhered on the glass surface, and these waterdrops significantly degrade the image quality and performance of many computer vision algorithms. To tackle these limitations, we propose a method to reconstruct the clear 3D scene implicitly from multi-view images degraded by waterdrops. Our method exploits an attention network to predict the location of waterdrops and then train a Neural Radiance Fields to recover the 3D scene implicitly. By leveraging the strong scene representation capabilities of NeRF, our method can render high-quality novel-view images with waterdrops removed. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our method is able to generate clear 3D scenes and outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) image adhesive waterdrop removal methods.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we explore the potential of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) technique for recovering the underlying 3D scene representation from a single temporal compressed image. SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, which not only reduces storage requirements but also offers potential privacy protection. Inspired by this, to take one step further, our approach builds upon the powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF, allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene structures. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive evaluations using both synthetic data and real data captured by our SCI system. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of image reconstruction and novel view image synthesis. Moreover, our method also exhibits the ability to restore high frame-rate multi-view consistent images by leveraging SCI and the rendering capabilities of NeRF.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing the viewed images from human brain activity bridges human and computer vision through the Brain-Computer Interface. The inherent variability in brain function between individuals leads existing literature to focus on acquiring separate models for each individual using their respective brain signal data, ignoring commonalities between these data. In this article, we devise Psychometry, an omnifit model for reconstructing images from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) obtained from different subjects. Psychometry incorporates an omni mixture-of-experts (Omni MoE) module where all the experts work together to capture the inter-subject commonalities, while each expert associated with subject-specific parameters copes with the individual differences. Moreover, Psychometry is equipped with a retrieval-enhanced inference strategy, termed Ecphory, which aims to enhance the learned fMRI representation via retrieving from prestored subject-specific memories. These designs collectively render Psychometry omnifit and efficient, enabling it to capture both inter-subject commonality and individual specificity across subjects. As a result, the enhanced fMRI representations serve as conditional signals to guide a generation model to reconstruct high-quality and realistic images, establishing Psychometry as state-of-the-art in terms of both high-level and low-level metrics.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal reasoning plays a vital role in bridging the gap between textual and visual information, enabling a deeper understanding of the context. This paper presents the Feature Swapping Multi-modal Reasoning (FSMR) model, designed to enhance multi-modal reasoning through feature swapping. FSMR leverages a pre-trained visual-language model as an encoder, accommodating both text and image inputs for effective feature representation from both modalities. It introduces a unique feature swapping module, enabling the exchange of features between identified objects in images and corresponding vocabulary words in text, thereby enhancing the model's comprehension of the interplay between images and text. To further bolster its multi-modal alignment capabilities, FSMR incorporates a multi-modal cross-attention mechanism, facilitating the joint modeling of textual and visual information. During training, we employ image-text matching and cross-entropy losses to ensure semantic consistency between visual and language elements. Extensive experiments on the PMR dataset demonstrate FSMR's superiority over state-of-the-art baseline models across various performance metrics.

- **Summary**: Human-centric Point Cloud Video Understanding (PVU) is an emerging field focused on extracting and interpreting human-related features from sequences of human point clouds, further advancing downstream human-centric tasks and applications. Previous works usually focus on tackling one specific task and rely on huge labeled data, which has poor generalization capability. Considering that human has specific characteristics, including the structural semantics of human body and the dynamics of human motions, we propose a unified framework to make full use of the prior knowledge and explore the inherent features in the data itself for generalized human-centric point cloud video understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various human-related tasks, including action recognition and 3D pose estimation. All datasets and code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering, enabling real-time production of high-quality renderings. However, the previous 3DGS-based methods have limitations in urban scenes due to reliance on initial Structure-from-Motion(SfM) points and difficulties in rendering distant, sky and low-texture areas. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid optimization method named HO-Gaussian, which combines a grid-based volume with the 3DGS pipeline. HO-Gaussian eliminates the dependency on SfM point initialization, allowing for rendering of urban scenes, and incorporates the Point Densitification to enhance rendering quality in problematic regions during training. Furthermore, we introduce Gaussian Direction Encoding as an alternative for spherical harmonics in the rendering pipeline, which enables view-dependent color representation. To account for multi-camera systems, we introduce neural warping to enhance object consistency across different cameras. Experimental results on widely used autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that HO-Gaussian achieves photo-realistic rendering in real-time on multi-camera urban datasets.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there have been significant advancements in 3D reconstruction and dense RGB-D SLAM systems. One notable development is the application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in these systems, which utilizes implicit neural representation to encode 3D scenes. This extension of NeRF to SLAM has shown promising results. However, the depth images obtained from consumer-grade RGB-D sensors are often sparse and noisy, which poses significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and affects the accuracy of the representation of the scene geometry. Moreover, the original hierarchical feature grid with occupancy value is inaccurate for scene geometry representation. Furthermore, the existing methods select random pixels for camera tracking, which leads to inaccurate localization and is not robust in real-world indoor environments. To this end, we present NeSLAM, an advanced framework that achieves accurate and dense depth estimation, robust camera tracking, and realistic synthesis of novel views. First, a depth completion and denoising network is designed to provide dense geometry prior and guide the neural implicit representation optimization. Second, the occupancy scene representation is replaced with Signed Distance Field (SDF) hierarchical scene representation for high-quality reconstruction and view synthesis. Furthermore, we also propose a NeRF-based self-supervised feature tracking algorithm for robust real-time tracking. Experiments on various indoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the system in reconstruction, tracking quality, and novel view synthesis.

- **Summary**: Traditionally for improving the segmentation performance of models, most approaches prefer to use adding more complex modules. And this is not suitable for the medical field, especially for mobile medical devices, where computationally loaded models are not suitable for real clinical environments due to computational resource constraints. Recently, state-space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have become a strong competitor to traditional CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we deeply explore the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba and propose an UltraLight Vision Mamba UNet (UltraLight VM-UNet) based on this. Specifically, we propose a method for processing features in parallel Vision Mamba, named PVM Layer, which achieves excellent performance with the lowest computational load while keeping the overall number of processing channels constant. We conducted comparisons and ablation experiments with several state-of-the-art lightweight models on three skin lesion public datasets and demonstrated that the UltraLight VM-UNet exhibits the same strong performance competitiveness with parameters of only 0.049M and GFLOPs of 0.060. In addition, this study deeply explores the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba, which will lay a theoretical foundation for Mamba to possibly become a new mainstream module for lightweighting in the future.

- **Summary**: Sparse training has emerged as a promising method for resource-efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications. However, the reliability of sparse models remains a crucial concern, particularly in detecting unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This study addresses the knowledge gap by investigating the reliability of sparse training from an OOD perspective and reveals that sparse training exacerbates OOD unreliability. The lack of unknown information and the sparse constraints hinder the effective exploration of weight space and accurate differentiation between known and unknown knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new unknown-aware sparse training method, which incorporates a loss modification, auto-tuning strategy, and a voting scheme to guide weight space exploration and mitigate confusion between known and unknown information without incurring significant additional costs or requiring access to additional OOD data. Theoretical insights demonstrate how our method reduces model confidence when faced with OOD samples. Empirical experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsity levels validate the effectiveness of our method, with improvements of up to \textbf{8.4\%} in AUROC while maintaining comparable or higher accuracy and calibration. This research enhances the understanding and readiness of sparse DNNs for deployment in resource-limited applications. Our code is available on: \url{https://github.com/StevenBoys/MOON}.

- **Summary**: Simultaneous functional PET/MR (sf-PET/MR) presents a cutting-edge multimodal neuroimaging technique. It provides an unprecedented opportunity for concurrently monitoring and integrating multifaceted brain networks built by spatiotemporally covaried metabolic activity, neural activity, and cerebral blood flow (perfusion). Albeit high scientific/clinical values, short in hardware accessibility of PET/MR hinders its applications, let alone modern AI-based PET/MR fusion models. Our objective is to develop a clinically feasible AI-based disease diagnosis model trained on comprehensive sf-PET/MR data with the power of, during inferencing, allowing single modality input (e.g., PET only) as well as enforcing multimodal-based accuracy. To this end, we propose MX-ARM, a multimodal MiXture-of-experts Alignment and Reconstruction Model. It is modality detachable and exchangeable, allocating different multi-layer perceptrons dynamically ("mixture of experts") through learnable weights to learn respective representations from different modalities. Such design will not sacrifice model performance in uni-modal situation. To fully exploit the inherent complex and nonlinear relation among modalities while producing fine-grained representations for uni-modal inference, we subsequently add a modal alignment module to line up a dominant modality (e.g., PET) with representations of auxiliary modalities (MR). We further adopt multimodal reconstruction to promote the quality of learned features. Experiments on precious multimodal sf-PET/MR data for Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis showcase the efficacy of our model toward clinically feasible precision medicine.

- **Summary**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims at identifying samples from unknown classes, playing a crucial role in trustworthy models against errors on unexpected inputs. Extensive research has been dedicated to exploring OOD detection in the vision modality. Vision-language models (VLMs) can leverage both textual and visual information for various multi-modal applications, whereas few OOD detection methods take into account information from the text modality. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc OOD detection method, called NegLabel, which takes a vast number of negative labels from extensive corpus databases. We design a novel scheme for the OOD score collaborated with negative labels. Theoretical analysis helps to understand the mechanism of negative labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method NegLabel achieves state-of-the-art performance on various OOD detection benchmarks and generalizes well on multiple VLM architectures. Furthermore, our method NegLabel exhibits remarkable robustness against diverse domain shifts. The codes are available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/NegLabel.

- **Summary**: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) for street scenes play a critical role in the autonomous driving simulation. The current mainstream technique to achieve it is neural rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Although thrilling progress has been made, when handling street scenes, current methods struggle to maintain rendering quality at the viewpoint that deviates significantly from the training viewpoints. This issue stems from the sparse training views captured by a fixed camera on a moving vehicle. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that enhances the capacity of 3DGS by leveraging prior from a Diffusion Model along with complementary multi-modal data. Specifically, we first fine-tune a Diffusion Model by adding images from adjacent frames as condition, meanwhile exploiting depth data from LiDAR point clouds to supply additional spatial information. Then we apply the Diffusion Model to regularize the 3DGS at unseen views during training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method compared with current state-of-the-art models, and demonstrate its advance in rendering images from broader views.

- **Summary**: Compression of large and performant vision foundation models (VFMs) into arbitrary bit-wise operations (BitOPs) allows their deployment on various hardware. We propose to fine-tune a VFM to a mixed-precision quantized supernet. The supernet-based neural architecture search (NAS) can be adopted for this purpose, which trains a supernet, and then subnets within arbitrary hardware budgets can be extracted. However, existing methods face difficulties in optimizing the mixed-precision search space and incurring large memory costs during training. To tackle these challenges, first, we study the effective search space design for fine-tuning a VFM by comparing different operators (such as resolution, feature size, width, depth, and bit-widths) in terms of performance and BitOPs reduction. Second, we propose memory-efficient supernet training using a low-rank adapter (LoRA) and a progressive training strategy. The proposed method is evaluated for the recently proposed VFM, Segment Anything Model, fine-tuned on segmentation tasks. The searched model yields about a 95% reduction in BitOPs without incurring performance degradation.

- **Summary**: We present SAM, a biologically-plausible selective attention-driven modulation approach to enhance classification models in a continual learning setting. Inspired by neurophysiological evidence that the primary visual cortex does not contribute to object manifold untangling for categorization and that primordial attention biases are still embedded in the modern brain, we propose to employ auxiliary saliency prediction features as a modulation signal to drive and stabilize the learning of a sequence of non-i.i.d. classification tasks. Experimental results confirm that SAM effectively enhances the performance (in some cases up to about twenty percent points) of state-of-the-art continual learning methods, both in class-incremental and task-incremental settings. Moreover, we show that attention-based modulation successfully encourages the learning of features that are more robust to the presence of spurious features and to adversarial attacks than baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Images from outdoor scenes may be taken under various weather conditions. It is well studied that weather impacts the performance of computer vision algorithms and needs to be handled properly. However, existing algorithms model weather condition as a discrete status and estimate it using multi-label classification. The fact is that, physically, specifically in meteorology, weather are modeled as a continuous and transitional status. Instead of directly implementing hard classification as existing multi-weather classification methods do, we consider the physical formulation of multi-weather conditions and model the impact of physical-related parameter on learning from the image appearance. In this paper, we start with solid revisit of the physics definition of weather and how it can be described as a continuous machine learning and computer vision task. Namely, we propose to model the weather uncertainty, where the level of probability and co-existence of multiple weather conditions are both considered. A Gaussian mixture model is used to encapsulate the weather uncertainty and a uncertainty-aware multi-weather learning scheme is proposed based on prior-posterior learning. A novel multi-weather co-presence estimation transformer (MeFormer) is proposed. In addition, a new multi-weather co-presence estimation (MePe) dataset, along with 14 fine-grained weather categories and 16,078 samples, is proposed to benchmark both conventional multi-label weather classification task and multi-weather co-presence estimation task. Large scale experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantial generalization capabilities on both the conventional multi-label weather classification task and the proposed multi-weather co-presence estimation task. Besides, modeling weather uncertainty also benefits adverse-weather semantic segmentation.

- **Summary**: Foundation models have exhibited unprecedented capabilities in tackling many domains and tasks. Models such as CLIP are currently widely used to bridge cross-modal representations, and text-to-image diffusion models are arguably the leading models in terms of realistic image generation. Image generative models are trained on massive datasets that provide them with powerful internal spatial representations. In this work, we explore the potential benefits of such representations, beyond image generation, in particular, for dense visual prediction tasks. We focus on the task of image segmentation, which is traditionally solved by training models on closed-vocabulary datasets, with pixel-level annotations. To avoid the annotation cost or training large diffusion models, we constraint our setup to be zero-shot and training-free. In a nutshell, our pipeline leverages different and relatively small-sized, open-source foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. The pipeline is as follows: the image is passed to both a captioner model (i.e. BLIP) and a diffusion model (i.e., Stable Diffusion Model) to generate a text description and visual representation, respectively. The features are clustered and binarized to obtain class agnostic masks for each object. These masks are then mapped to a textual class, using the CLIP model to support open-vocabulary. Finally, we add a refinement step that allows to obtain a more precise segmentation mask. Our approach (dubbed FreeSeg-Diff), which does not rely on any training, outperforms many training-based approaches on both Pascal VOC and COCO datasets. In addition, we show very competitive results compared to the recent weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. We provide comprehensive experiments showing the superiority of diffusion model features compared to other pretrained models. Project page: https://bcorrad.github.io/freesegdiff/

- **Summary**: Image deblurring is a process of restoring a high quality image from the corresponding blurred image. Significant progress in this field has been made possible by the emergence of various effective deep learning models, including CNNs and Transformers. However, these methods often face the dilemma between eliminating long-range blur degradation perturbations and maintaining computational efficiency, which hinders their practical application. To address this issue, we propose an efficient image deblurring network that leverages selective structured state spaces model to aggregate enriched and accurate features. Specifically, we design an aggregate local and global block (ALGBlock) to capture and fuse both local invariant properties and non-local information. The ALGBlock consists of two blocks: (1) The local block models local connectivity using simplified channel attention. (2) The global block captures long-range dependency features with linear complexity through selective structured state spaces. Nevertheless, we note that the image details are local features of images, we accentuate the local part for restoration by recalibrating the weight when aggregating the two branches for recovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on widely used benchmarks, highlighting its superior performance.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the application of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) strategies in training machine learning models in the medical domain. In this case a doctor-in-the-loop approach is proposed to leverage human expertise in dealing with large and complex data. Specifically, the paper deals with the integration of genomic data and Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) analysis of breast cancer. Three different tasks were developed: segmentation of histopathological images, classification of this images regarding the genomic subtype of the cancer and, finally, interpretation of the machine learning results. The involvement of a pathologist helped us to develop a better segmentation model and to enhance the explainatory capabilities of the models, but the classification results were suboptimal, highlighting the limitations of this approach: despite involving human experts, complex domains can still pose challenges, and a HITL approach may not always be effective.

- **Summary**: Panoptic segmentation, combining semantic and instance segmentation, stands as a cutting-edge computer vision task. Despite recent progress with deep learning models, the dynamic nature of real-world applications necessitates continual learning, where models adapt to new classes (plasticity) over time without forgetting old ones (catastrophic forgetting). Current continual segmentation methods often rely on distillation strategies like knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling, which are effective but result in increased training complexity and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient method for continual panoptic segmentation based on Visual Prompt Tuning, dubbed ECLIPSE. Our approach involves freezing the base model parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of prompt embeddings, addressing both catastrophic forgetting and plasticity and significantly reducing the trainable parameters. To mitigate inherent challenges such as error propagation and semantic drift in continual segmentation, we propose logit manipulation to effectively leverage common knowledge across the classes. Experiments on ADE20K continual panoptic segmentation benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ECLIPSE, notably its robustness against catastrophic forgetting and its reasonable plasticity, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Most image-to-image translation models postulate that a unique correspondence exists between the semantic classes of the source and target domains. However, this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios due to divergent distributions, different class sets, and asymmetrical information representation. As conventional GANs attempt to generate images that match the distribution of the target domain, they may hallucinate spurious instances of classes absent from the source domain, thereby diminishing the usefulness and reliability of translated images. CycleGAN-based methods are also known to hide the mismatched information in the generated images to bypass cycle consistency objectives, a process known as steganography. In response to the challenge of non-bijective image translation, we introduce StegoGAN, a novel model that leverages steganography to prevent spurious features in generated images. Our approach enhances the semantic consistency of the translated images without requiring additional postprocessing or supervision. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that StegoGAN outperforms existing GAN-based models across various non-bijective image-to-image translation tasks, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our code and pretrained models are accessible at https://github.com/sian-wusidi/StegoGAN.

- **Summary**: Recent methods for audio-driven talking head synthesis often optimize neural radiance fields (NeRF) on a monocular talking portrait video, leveraging its capability to render high-fidelity and 3D-consistent novel-view frames. However, they often struggle to reconstruct complete face geometry due to the absence of comprehensive 3D information in the input monocular videos. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio-driven talking head synthesis framework, called Talk3D, that can faithfully reconstruct its plausible facial geometries by effectively adopting the pre-trained 3D-aware generative prior. Given the personalized 3D generative model, we present a novel audio-guided attention U-Net architecture that predicts the dynamic face variations in the NeRF space driven by audio. Furthermore, our model is further modulated by audio-unrelated conditioning tokens which effectively disentangle variations unrelated to audio features. Compared to existing methods, our method excels in generating realistic facial geometries even under extreme head poses. We also conduct extensive experiments showing our approach surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

- **Summary**: Online dense mapping of urban scenes forms a fundamental cornerstone for scene understanding and navigation of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements in mapping methods are mainly based on NeRF, whose rendering speed is too slow to meet online requirements. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with its rendering speed hundreds of times faster than NeRF, holds greater potential in online dense mapping. However, integrating 3DGS into a street-view dense mapping framework still faces two challenges, including incomplete reconstruction due to the absence of geometric information beyond the LiDAR coverage area and extensive computation for reconstruction in large urban scenes. To this end, we propose HGS-Mapping, an online dense mapping framework in unbounded large-scale scenes. To attain complete construction, our framework introduces Hybrid Gaussian Representation, which models different parts of the entire scene using Gaussians with distinct properties. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid Gaussian initialization mechanism and an adaptive update method to achieve high-fidelity and rapid reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate Gaussian representation into online dense mapping of urban scenes. Our approach achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy while only employing 66% number of Gaussians, leading to 20% faster reconstruction speed.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal brain images from MRI scans are widely used in clinical diagnosis to provide complementary information from different modalities. However, obtaining fully paired multi-modal images in practice is challenging due to various factors, such as time, cost, and artifacts, resulting in modality-missing brain images. To address this problem, unsupervised multi-modal brain image translation has been extensively studied. Existing methods suffer from the problem of brain tumor deformation during translation, as they fail to focus on the tumor areas when translating the whole images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised tumor-aware distillation teacher-student network called UTAD-Net, which is capable of perceiving and translating tumor areas precisely. Specifically, our model consists of two parts: a teacher network and a student network. The teacher network learns an end-to-end mapping from source to target modality using unpaired images and corresponding tumor masks first. Then, the translation knowledge is distilled into the student network, enabling it to generate more realistic tumor areas and whole images without masks. Experiments show that our model achieves competitive performance on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image quality compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated images on downstream segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/scut-HC/UTAD-Net.

- **Summary**: Aiming at the metro video surveillance system has not been able to effectively solve the metro crowd density estimation problem, a Metro Crowd density estimation Network (called MCNet) is proposed to automatically classify crowd density level of passengers. Firstly, an Integrating Multi-scale Attention (IMA) module is proposed to enhance the ability of the plain classifiers to extract semantic crowd texture features to accommodate to the characteristics of the crowd texture feature. The innovation of the IMA module is to fuse the dilation convolution, multiscale feature extraction and attention mechanism to obtain multi-scale crowd feature activation from a larger receptive field with lower computational cost, and to strengthen the crowds activation state of convolutional features in top layers. Secondly, a novel lightweight crowd texture feature extraction network is proposed, which can directly process video frames and automatically extract texture features for crowd density estimation, while its faster image processing speed and fewer network parameters make it flexible to be deployed on embedded platforms with limited hardware resources. Finally, this paper integrates IMA module and the lightweight crowd texture feature extraction network to construct the MCNet, and validate the feasibility of this network on image classification dataset: Cifar10 and four crowd density datasets: PETS2009, Mall, QUT and SH_METRO to validate the MCNet whether can be a suitable solution for crowd density estimation in metro video surveillance where there are image processing challenges such as high density, high occlusion, perspective distortion and limited hardware resources.

- **Summary**: Wearable sensor human activity recognition (HAR) is a crucial area of research in activity sensing. While transformer-based temporal deep learning models have been extensively studied and implemented, their large number of parameters present significant challenges in terms of system computing load and memory usage, rendering them unsuitable for real-time mobile activity recognition applications. Recently, an efficient hardware-aware state space model (SSM) called Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative. Mamba demonstrates strong potential in long sequence modeling, boasts a simpler network architecture, and offers an efficient hardware-aware design. Leveraging SSM for activity recognition represents an appealing avenue for exploration. In this study, we introduce HARMamba, which employs a more lightweight selective SSM as the foundational model architecture for activity recognition. The goal is to address the computational resource constraints encountered in real-time activity recognition scenarios. Our approach involves processing sensor data flow by independently learning each channel and segmenting the data into "patches". The marked sensor sequence's position embedding serves as the input token for the bidirectional state space model, ultimately leading to activity categorization through the classification head. Compared to established activity recognition frameworks like Transformer-based models, HARMamba achieves superior performance while also reducing computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, our proposed method has been extensively tested on four public activity datasets: PAMAP2, WISDM, UNIMIB, and UCI, demonstrating impressive performance in activity recognition tasks.

- **Summary**: In this research, we present a novel approach to motion customization in video generation, addressing the widespread gap in the thorough exploration of motion representation within video generative models. Recognizing the unique challenges posed by video's spatiotemporal nature, our method introduces Motion Embeddings, a set of explicit, temporally coherent one-dimensional embeddings derived from a given video. These embeddings are designed to integrate seamlessly with the temporal transformer modules of video diffusion models, modulating self-attention computations across frames without compromising spatial integrity. Our approach offers a compact and efficient solution to motion representation and enables complex manipulations of motion characteristics through vector arithmetic in the embedding space. Furthermore, we identify the Temporal Discrepancy in video generative models, which refers to variations in how different motion modules process temporal relationships between frames. We leverage this understanding to optimize the integration of our motion embeddings. Our contributions include the introduction of a tailored motion embedding for customization tasks, insights into the temporal processing differences in video models, and a demonstration of the practical advantages and effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments.

- **Summary**: Geological maps are an extremely valuable source of information for the Earth sciences. They provide insights into mineral exploration, vulnerability to natural hazards, and many other applications. These maps are created using numerical or conceptual models that use geological observations to extrapolate data. Geostatistical techniques have traditionally been used to generate reliable predictions that take into account the spatial patterns inherent in the data. However, as the number of auxiliary variables increases, these methods become more labor-intensive. Additionally, traditional machine learning methods often struggle with spatially correlated data and extracting valuable non-linear information from geoscientific datasets. To address these limitations, a new architecture called the Spatially Constrained Bayesian Network (SCB-Net) has been developed. The SCB-Net aims to effectively exploit the information from auxiliary variables while producing spatially constrained predictions. It is made up of two parts, the first part focuses on learning underlying patterns in the auxiliary variables while the second part integrates ground-truth data and the learned embeddings from the first part. Moreover, to assess model uncertainty, a technique called Monte Carlo dropout is used as a Bayesian approximation. The SCB-Net has been applied to two selected areas in northern Quebec, Canada, and has demonstrated its potential in generating field-data-constrained lithological maps while allowing assessment of prediction uncertainty for decision-making. This study highlights the promising advancements of deep neural networks in geostatistics, particularly in handling complex spatial feature learning tasks, leading to improved spatial information techniques.

- **Summary**: The generic large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is rapidly developing, but still perform poorly in Remote Sensing (RS) domain, which is due to the unique and specialized nature of RS imagery and the comparatively limited spatial perception of current VLMs. Existing Remote Sensing specific Vision Language Models (RSVLMs) still have considerable potential for improvement, primarily owing to the lack of large-scale, high-quality RS vision-language datasets. We constructed HqDC-1.4M, the large scale High quality and Detailed Captions for RS images, containing 1.4 million image-caption pairs, which not only enhance the RSVLM's understanding of RS images but also significantly improve the model's spatial perception abilities, such as localization and counting, thereby increasing the helpfulness of the RSVLM. Moreover, to address the inevitable "hallucination" problem in RSVLM, we developed RSSA, the first dataset aimed at enhancing the Self-Awareness capability of RSVLMs. By incorporating a variety of unanswerable questions into typical RS visual question-answering tasks, RSSA effectively improves the truthfulness and reduces the hallucinations of the model's outputs, thereby enhancing the honesty of the RSVLM. Based on these datasets, we proposed the H2RSVLM, the Helpful and Honest Remote Sensing Vision Language Model. H2RSVLM has achieved outstanding performance on multiple RS public datasets and is capable of recognizing and refusing to answer the unanswerable questions, effectively mitigating the incorrect generations. We will release the code, data and model weights at https://github.com/opendatalab/H2RSVLM .

- **Summary**: Multi-target multi-camera tracking is a crucial task that involves identifying and tracking individuals over time using video streams from multiple cameras. This task has practical applications in various fields, such as visual surveillance, crowd behavior analysis, and anomaly detection. However, due to the difficulty and cost of collecting and labeling data, existing datasets for this task are either synthetically generated or artificially constructed within a controlled camera network setting, which limits their ability to model real-world dynamics and generalize to diverse camera configurations. To address this issue, we present MTMMC, a real-world, large-scale dataset that includes long video sequences captured by 16 multi-modal cameras in two different environments - campus and factory - across various time, weather, and season conditions. This dataset provides a challenging test-bed for studying multi-camera tracking under diverse real-world complexities and includes an additional input modality of spatially aligned and temporally synchronized RGB and thermal cameras, which enhances the accuracy of multi-camera tracking. MTMMC is a super-set of existing datasets, benefiting independent fields such as person detection, re-identification, and multiple object tracking. We provide baselines and new learning setups on this dataset and set the reference scores for future studies. The datasets, models, and test server will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Concept personalization methods enable large text-to-image models to learn specific subjects (e.g., objects/poses/3D models) and synthesize renditions in new contexts. Given that the image references are highly biased towards visual attributes, state-of-the-art personalization models tend to overfit the whole subject and cannot disentangle visual characteristics in pixel space. In this study, we proposed a more challenging setting, namely fine-grained visual appearance personalization. Different from existing methods, we allow users to provide a sentence describing the desired attributes. A novel decoupled self-augmentation strategy is proposed to generate target-related and non-target samples to learn user-specified visual attributes. These augmented data allow for refining the model's understanding of the target attribute while mitigating the impact of unrelated attributes. At the inference stage, adjustments are conducted on semantic space through the learned target and non-target embeddings to further enhance the disentanglement of target attributes. Extensive experiments on various kinds of visual attributes with SOTA personalization methods show the ability of the proposed method to mimic target visual appearance in novel contexts, thus improving the controllability and flexibility of personalization.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defective images and localize their defects (if any). Ideally, AD models should be able to detect defects over many image classes; without relying on hard-coded class names that can be uninformative or inconsistent across datasets; learn without anomaly supervision; and be robust to the long-tailed distributions of real-world applications. To address these challenges, we formulate the problem of long-tailed AD by introducing several datasets with different levels of class imbalance and metrics for performance evaluation. We then propose a novel method, LTAD, to detect defects from multiple and long-tailed classes, without relying on dataset class names. LTAD combines AD by reconstruction and semantic AD modules. AD by reconstruction is implemented with a transformer-based reconstruction module. Semantic AD is implemented with a binary classifier, which relies on learned pseudo class names and a pretrained foundation model. These modules are learned over two phases. Phase 1 learns the pseudo-class names and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for feature synthesis that augments the training data to combat long-tails. Phase 2 then learns the parameters of the reconstruction and classification modules of LTAD. Extensive experiments using the proposed long-tailed datasets show that LTAD substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for most forms of dataset imbalance.

- **Summary**: Holography stands at the forefront of visual technology innovation, offering immersive, three-dimensional visualizations through the manipulation of light wave amplitude and phase. Contemporary research in hologram generation has predominantly focused on image-to-hologram conversion, producing holograms from existing images. These approaches, while effective, inherently limit the scope of innovation and creativity in hologram generation. In response to this limitation, we present Holo-VQVAE, a novel generative framework tailored for phase-only holograms (POHs). Holo-VQVAE leverages the architecture of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders, enabling it to learn the complex distributions of POHs. Furthermore, it integrates the Angular Spectrum Method into the training process, facilitating learning in the image domain. This framework allows for the generation of unseen, diverse holographic content directly from its intricately learned latent space without requiring pre-existing images. This pioneering work paves the way for groundbreaking applications and methodologies in holographic content creation, opening a new era in the exploration of holographic content.

- **Summary**: Despite their exceptional generative abilities, large text-to-image diffusion models, much like skilled but careless artists, often struggle with accurately depicting visual relationships between objects. This issue, as we uncover through careful analysis, arises from a misaligned text encoder that struggles to interpret specific relationships and differentiate the logical order of associated objects. To resolve this, we introduce a novel task termed Relation Rectification, aiming to refine the model to accurately represent a given relationship it initially fails to generate. To address this, we propose an innovative solution utilizing a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN). It models the directional relationships between relation terms and corresponding objects within the input prompts. Specifically, we optimize the HGCN on a pair of prompts with identical relational words but reversed object orders, supplemented by a few reference images. The lightweight HGCN adjusts the text embeddings generated by the text encoder, ensuring the accurate reflection of the textual relation in the embedding space. Crucially, our method retains the parameters of the text encoder and diffusion model, preserving the model's robust performance on unrelated descriptions. We validated our approach on a newly curated dataset of diverse relational data, demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative enhancements in generating images with precise visual relations.

- **Summary**: Head pose estimation has become a crucial area of research in computer vision given its usefulness in a wide range of applications, including robotics, surveillance, or driver attention monitoring. One of the most difficult challenges in this field is managing head occlusions that frequently take place in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient framework that is robust in real world head occlusion scenarios. In particular, we propose an unsupervised latent embedding clustering with regression and classification components for each pose angle. The model optimizes latent feature representations for occluded and non-occluded images through a clustering term while improving fine-grained angle predictions. Experimental evaluation on in-the-wild head pose benchmark datasets reveal competitive performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methodologies with the advantage of having a significant data reduction. We observe a substantial improvement in occluded head pose estimation. Also, an ablation study is conducted to ascertain the impact of the clustering term within our proposed framework.

- **Summary**: Medical image segmentation of anatomical structures and pathology is crucial in modern clinical diagnosis, disease study, and treatment planning. To date, great progress has been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, but most methods still lack data efficiency, generalizability, and interactability. Consequently, the development of new, precise segmentation methods that demand fewer labeled datasets is of utmost importance in medical image analysis. Recently, the emergence of foundation models, such as CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with comprehensive cross-domain representation opened the door for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, exploration of these models for data-efficient medical image segmentation is still limited, but is highly necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called MedCLIP-SAM that combines CLIP and SAM models to generate segmentation of clinical scans using text prompts in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. To achieve this, we employed a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss to fine-tune the BiomedCLIP model and the recent gScoreCAM to generate prompts to obtain segmentation masks from SAM in a zero-shot setting. Additionally, we explored the use of zero-shot segmentation labels in a weakly supervised paradigm to improve the segmentation quality further. By extensively testing three diverse segmentation tasks and medical image modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, and lung X-ray), our proposed framework has demonstrated excellent accuracy.

- **Summary**: Temporal action detection (TAD) aims to locate action positions and recognize action categories in long-term untrimmed videos. Although many methods have achieved promising results, their robustness has not been thoroughly studied. In practice, we observe that temporal information in videos can be occasionally corrupted, such as missing or blurred frames. Interestingly, existing methods often incur a significant performance drop even if only one frame is affected. To formally evaluate the robustness, we establish two temporal corruption robustness benchmarks, namely THUMOS14-C and ActivityNet-v1.3-C. In this paper, we extensively analyze the robustness of seven leading TAD methods and obtain some interesting findings: 1) Existing methods are particularly vulnerable to temporal corruptions, and end-to-end methods are often more susceptible than those with a pre-trained feature extractor; 2) Vulnerability mainly comes from localization error rather than classification error; 3) When corruptions occur in the middle of an action instance, TAD models tend to yield the largest performance drop. Besides building a benchmark, we further develop a simple but effective robust training method to defend against temporal corruptions, through the FrameDrop augmentation and Temporal-Robust Consistency loss. Remarkably, our approach not only improves robustness but also yields promising improvements on clean data. We believe that this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video analysis.

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have achieved high performance in medical applications, however, their adoption in clinical practice is hindered due to their black-box nature. Self-explainable models, like prototype-based models, can be especially beneficial as they are interpretable by design. However, if the learnt prototypes are of low quality then the prototype-based models are as good as black-box. Having high quality prototypes is a pre-requisite for a truly interpretable model. In this work, we propose a prototype evaluation framework for coherence (PEF-C) for quantitatively evaluating the quality of the prototypes based on domain knowledge. We show the use of PEF-C in the context of breast cancer prediction using mammography. Existing works on prototype-based models on breast cancer prediction using mammography have focused on improving the classification performance of prototype-based models compared to black-box models and have evaluated prototype quality through anecdotal evidence. We are the first to go beyond anecdotal evidence and evaluate the quality of the mammography prototypes systematically using our PEF-C. Specifically, we apply three state-of-the-art prototype-based models, ProtoPNet, BRAIxProtoPNet++ and PIP-Net on mammography images for breast cancer prediction and evaluate these models w.r.t. i) classification performance, and ii) quality of the prototypes, on three public datasets. Our results show that prototype-based models are competitive with black-box models in terms of classification performance, and achieve a higher score in detecting ROIs. However, the quality of the prototypes are not yet sufficient and can be improved in aspects of relevance, purity and learning a variety of prototypes. We call the XAI community to systematically evaluate the quality of the prototypes to check their true usability in high stake decisions and improve such models further.

- **Summary**: The interaction between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) is a crucial factor that reflects the effectiveness of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level comprehension and limit interaction to textual instructions, thereby constraining their flexibility in usage and depth of response. In this paper, we introduce the Draw-and-Understand project: a new model, a multi-domain dataset, and a challenging benchmark for visual prompting. Specifically, we propose SPHINX-V, a new end-to-end trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that connects a vision encoder, a visual prompt encoder and an LLM for various visual prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shape) and language understanding. To advance visual prompting research for MLLMs, we introduce MDVP-Data and MDVP-Bench. MDVP-Data features a multi-domain dataset containing 1.6M unique image-visual prompt-text instruction-following samples, including natural images, document images, OCR images, mobile screenshots, web screenshots, and multi-panel images. Furthermore, we present MDVP-Bench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark to assess a model's capability in understanding visual prompting instructions. Our experiments demonstrate SPHINX-V's impressive multimodal interaction capabilities through visual prompting, revealing significant improvements in detailed pixel-level description and question-answering abilities.

- **Summary**: Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle. With plans for upcoming space-borne missions like BIOMASS to monitor forestry, several airborne missions, including TropiSAR and AfriSAR campaigns, have been successfully launched and experimented. Typical Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography (TomoSAR) methods involve complex models with low accuracy and high computation costs. In recent years, deep learning methods have also gained attention in the TomoSAR framework, showing interesting performance. Recently, a solution based on a fully connected Tomographic Neural Network (TSNN) has demonstrated its effectiveness in accurately estimating forest and ground heights by exploiting the pixel-wise elements of the covariance matrix derived from TomoSAR data. This work instead goes beyond the pixel-wise approach to define a context-aware deep learning-based solution named CATSNet. A convolutional neural network is considered to leverage patch-based information and extract features from a neighborhood rather than focus on a single pixel. The training is conducted by considering TomoSAR data as the input and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) values as the ground truth. The experimental results show striking advantages in both performance and generalization ability by leveraging context information within Multiple Baselines (MB) TomoSAR data across different polarimetric modalities, surpassing existing techniques.

- **Summary**: Touch and vision go hand in hand, mutually enhancing our ability to understand the world. From a research perspective, the problem of mixing touch and vision is underexplored and presents interesting challenges. To this end, we propose Tactile-Informed 3DGS, a novel approach that incorporates touch data (local depth maps) with multi-view vision data to achieve surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our method optimises 3D Gaussian primitives to accurately model the object's geometry at points of contact. By creating a framework that decreases the transmittance at touch locations, we achieve a refined surface reconstruction, ensuring a uniformly smooth depth map. Touch is particularly useful when considering non-Lambertian objects (e.g. shiny or reflective surfaces) since contemporary methods tend to fail to reconstruct with fidelity specular highlights. By combining vision and tactile sensing, we achieve more accurate geometry reconstructions with fewer images than prior methods. We conduct evaluation on objects with glossy and reflective surfaces and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, offering significant improvements in reconstruction quality.

- **Summary**: Counterfactual image generation is pivotal for understanding the causal relations of variables, with applications in interpretability and generation of unbiased synthetic data. However, evaluating image generation is a long-standing challenge in itself. The need to evaluate counterfactual generation compounds on this challenge, precisely because counterfactuals, by definition, are hypothetical scenarios without observable ground truths. In this paper, we present a novel comprehensive framework aimed at benchmarking counterfactual image generation methods. We incorporate metrics that focus on evaluating diverse aspects of counterfactuals, such as composition, effectiveness, minimality of interventions, and image realism. We assess the performance of three distinct conditional image generation model types, based on the Structural Causal Model paradigm. Our work is accompanied by a user-friendly Python package which allows to further evaluate and benchmark existing and future counterfactual image generation methods. Our framework is extendable to additional SCM and other causal methods, generative models, and datasets.

- **Summary**: While novel view synthesis (NVS) has made substantial progress in 3D computer vision, it typically requires an initial estimation of camera intrinsics and extrinsics from dense viewpoints. This pre-processing is usually conducted via a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline, a procedure that can be slow and unreliable, particularly in sparse-view scenarios with insufficient matched features for accurate reconstruction. In this work, we integrate the strengths of point-based representations (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting, 3D-GS) with end-to-end dense stereo models (DUSt3R) to tackle the complex yet unresolved issues in NVS under unconstrained settings, which encompasses pose-free and sparse view challenges. Our framework, InstantSplat, unifies dense stereo priors with 3D-GS to build 3D Gaussians of large-scale scenes from sparseview & pose-free images in less than 1 minute. Specifically, InstantSplat comprises a Coarse Geometric Initialization (CGI) module that swiftly establishes a preliminary scene structure and camera parameters across all training views, utilizing globally-aligned 3D point maps derived from a pre-trained dense stereo pipeline. This is followed by the Fast 3D-Gaussian Optimization (F-3DGO) module, which jointly optimizes the 3D Gaussian attributes and the initialized poses with pose regularization. Experiments conducted on the large-scale outdoor Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that InstantSplat significantly improves SSIM (by 32%) while concurrently reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 80%. These establish InstantSplat as a viable solution for scenarios involving posefree and sparse-view conditions. Project page: instantsplat.github.io.

- **Summary**: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) treat text descriptions as a unit, confusing individual concepts in a prompt and impairing visual semantic matching and reasoning. An important aspect of reasoning in logic and language is negations. This paper highlights the limitations of popular VLMs such as CLIP, at understanding the implications of negations, i.e., the effect of the word "not" in a given prompt. To enable evaluation of VLMs on fluent prompts with negations, we present CC-Neg, a dataset containing 228,246 images, true captions and their corresponding negated captions. Using CC-Neg along with modifications to the contrastive loss of CLIP, our proposed CoN-CLIP framework, has an improved understanding of negations. This training paradigm improves CoN-CLIP's ability to encode semantics reliably, resulting in 3.85% average gain in top-1 accuracy for zero-shot image classification across 8 datasets. Further, CoN-CLIP outperforms CLIP on challenging compositionality benchmarks such as SugarCREPE by 4.4%, showcasing emergent compositional understanding of objects, relations, and attributes in text. Overall, our work addresses a crucial limitation of VLMs by introducing a dataset and framework that strengthens semantic associations between images and text, demonstrating improved large-scale foundation models with significantly reduced computational cost, promoting efficiency and accessibility.

- **Summary**: Continual Learning (CL) enables machine learning models to learn from continuously shifting new training data in absence of data from old tasks. Recently, pretrained vision transformers combined with prompt tuning have shown promise for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL. These approaches rely on a pool of learnable prompts which can be inefficient in sharing knowledge across tasks leading to inferior performance. In addition, the lack of fine-grained layer specific prompts does not allow these to fully express the strength of the prompts for CL. We address these limitations by proposing ConvPrompt, a novel convolutional prompt creation mechanism that maintains layer-wise shared embeddings, enabling both layer-specific learning and better concept transfer across tasks. The intelligent use of convolution enables us to maintain a low parameter overhead without compromising performance. We further leverage Large Language Models to generate fine-grained text descriptions of each category which are used to get task similarity and dynamically decide the number of prompts to be learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvPrompt and improves SOTA by ~3% with significantly less parameter overhead. We also perform strong ablation over various modules to disentangle the importance of different components.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D detectors achieve remarkable performance on cars and smaller objects. However, their performance drops on larger objects, leading to fatal accidents. Some attribute the failures to training data scarcity or their receptive field requirements of large objects. In this paper, we highlight this understudied problem of generalization to large objects. We find that modern frontal detectors struggle to generalize to large objects even on nearly balanced datasets. We argue that the cause of failure is the sensitivity of depth regression losses to noise of larger objects. To bridge this gap, we comprehensively investigate regression and dice losses, examining their robustness under varying error levels and object sizes. We mathematically prove that the dice loss leads to superior noise-robustness and model convergence for large objects compared to regression losses for a simplified case. Leveraging our theoretical insights, we propose SeaBird (Segmentation in Bird's View) as the first step towards generalizing to large objects. SeaBird effectively integrates BEV segmentation on foreground objects for 3D detection, with the segmentation head trained with the dice loss. SeaBird achieves SoTA results on the KITTI-360 leaderboard and improves existing detectors on the nuScenes leaderboard, particularly for large objects.

- **Summary**: Adapting models pre-trained on large-scale datasets to a variety of downstream tasks is a common strategy in deep learning. Consequently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising way to adapt pre-trained models to different tasks while training only a minimal number of parameters. While most of these methods are designed for single-task adaptation, parameter-efficient training in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) architectures is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MTLoRA, a novel framework for parameter-efficient training of MTL models. MTLoRA employs Task-Agnostic and Task-Specific Low-Rank Adaptation modules, which effectively disentangle the parameter space in MTL fine-tuning, thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both task specialization and interaction within MTL contexts. We applied MTLoRA to hierarchical-transformer-based MTL architectures, adapting them to multiple downstream dense prediction tasks. Our extensive experiments on the PASCAL dataset show that MTLoRA achieves higher accuracy on downstream tasks compared to fully fine-tuning the MTL model while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 3.6x. Furthermore, MTLoRA establishes a Pareto-optimal trade-off between the number of trainable parameters and the accuracy of the downstream tasks, outperforming current state-of-the-art parameter-efficient training methods in both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available.

- **Summary**: Modern video segmentation methods adopt object queries to perform inter-frame association and demonstrate satisfactory performance in tracking continuously appearing objects despite large-scale motion and transient occlusion.   However, they all underperform on newly emerging and disappearing objects that are common in the real world because they attempt to model object emergence and disappearance through feature transitions between background and foreground queries that have significant feature gaps. We introduce Dynamic Anchor Queries (DAQ) to shorten the transition gap between the anchor and target queries by dynamically generating anchor queries based on the features of potential candidates.   Furthermore, we introduce a query-level object Emergence and Disappearance Simulation (EDS) strategy, which unleashes DAQ's potential without any additional cost.   Finally, we combine our proposed DAQ and EDS with DVIS~\cite{zhang2023dvis} to obtain DVIS-DAQ.   Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVIS-DAQ achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on five mainstream video segmentation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved rapid progress, sparking numerous studies to evaluate their multi-modal capabilities. However, we dig into current evaluation works and identify two primary issues: 1) Visual content is unnecessary for many samples. The answers can be directly inferred from the questions and options, or the world knowledge embedded in LLMs. This phenomenon is prevalent across current benchmarks. For instance, GeminiPro achieves 42.9% on the MMMU benchmark without any visual input, and outperforms the random choice baseline across six benchmarks over 20% on average. 2) Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. LLM and LVLM could still answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content, indicating the memorizing of these samples within large-scale training data. For example, Sphinx-X-MoE gets 43.6% on MMMU without accessing images, surpassing its LLM backbone with 17.9%. Both problems lead to misjudgments of actual multi-modal gains and potentially misguide the study of LVLM. To this end, we present MMStar, an elite vision-indispensable multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,500 samples meticulously selected by humans. MMStar benchmarks 6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes, aiming to evaluate LVLMs' multi-modal capacities with carefully balanced and purified samples. These samples are first roughly selected from current benchmarks with an automated pipeline, human review is then involved to ensure each curated sample exhibits visual dependency, minimal data leakage, and requires advanced multi-modal capabilities. Moreover, two metrics are developed to measure data leakage and actual performance gain in multi-modal training. We evaluate 16 leading LVLMs on MMStar to assess their multi-modal capabilities, and on 7 benchmarks with the proposed metrics to investigate their data leakage and actual multi-modal gain.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel and significant challenge for Vision Language Models (VLMs), termed Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD). UPD examines the VLM's ability to withhold answers when faced with unsolvable problems in the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UPD encompasses three distinct settings: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD). To deeply investigate the UPD problem, extensive experiments indicate that most VLMs, including GPT-4V and LLaVA-Next-34B, struggle with our benchmarks to varying extents, highlighting significant room for the improvements. To address UPD, we explore both training-free and training-based solutions, offering new insights into their effectiveness and limitations. We hope our insights, together with future efforts within the proposed UPD settings, will enhance the broader understanding and development of more practical and reliable VLMs.

- **Summary**: Machine learning models struggle with generalization when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples with unexpected distribution shifts. For vision tasks, recent studies have shown that test-time adaptation employing diffusion models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy improvements on OOD samples by generating new samples that align with the model's domain without the need to modify the model's weights. Unfortunately, those studies have primarily focused on pixel-level corruptions, thereby lacking the generalization to adapt to a broader range of OOD types. We introduce Generalized Diffusion Adaptation (GDA), a novel diffusion-based test-time adaptation method robust against diverse OOD types. Specifically, GDA iteratively guides the diffusion by applying a marginal entropy loss derived from the model, in conjunction with style and content preservation losses during the reverse sampling process. In other words, GDA considers the model's output behavior with the semantic information of the samples as a whole, which can reduce ambiguity in downstream tasks during the generation process. Evaluation across various popular model architectures and OOD benchmarks shows that GDA consistently outperforms prior work on diffusion-driven adaptation. Notably, it achieves the highest classification accuracy improvements, ranging from 4.4\% to 5.02\% on ImageNet-C and 2.5\% to 7.4\% on Rendition, Sketch, and Stylized benchmarks. This performance highlights GDA's generalization to a broader range of OOD benchmarks.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Neural approaches have shown a significant progress on camera-based reconstruction. But they require either a fairly dense sampling of the viewing sphere, or pre-training on an existing dataset, thereby limiting their generalizability. In contrast, photometric stereo (PS) approaches have shown great potential for achieving high-quality reconstruction under sparse viewpoints. Yet, they are impractical because they typically require tedious laboratory conditions, are restricted to dark rooms, and often multi-staged, making them subject to accumulated errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose an end-to-end uncalibrated multi-view PS framework for reconstructing high-resolution shapes acquired from sparse viewpoints in a real-world environment. We relax the dark room assumption, and allow a combination of static ambient lighting and dynamic near LED lighting, thereby enabling easy data capture outside the lab. Experimental validation confirms that it outperforms existing baseline approaches in the regime of sparse viewpoints by a large margin. This allows to bring high-accuracy 3D reconstruction from the dark room to the real world, while maintaining a reasonable data capture complexity.

- **Summary**: Low-precision quantization is recognized for its efficacy in neural network optimization. Our analysis reveals that non-quantized elementwise operations which are prevalent in layers such as parameterized activation functions, batch normalization, and quantization scaling dominate the inference cost of low-precision models. These non-quantized elementwise operations are commonly overlooked in SOTA efficiency metrics such as Arithmetic Computation Effort (ACE). In this paper, we propose ACEv2 - an extended version of ACE which offers a better alignment with the inference cost of quantized models and their energy consumption on ML hardware. Moreover, we introduce PikeLPN, a model that addresses these efficiency issues by applying quantization to both elementwise operations and multiply-accumulate operations. In particular, we present a novel quantization technique for batch normalization layers named QuantNorm which allows for quantizing the batch normalization parameters without compromising the model performance. Additionally, we propose applying Double Quantization where the quantization scaling parameters are quantized. Furthermore, we recognize and resolve the issue of distribution mismatch in Separable Convolution layers by introducing Distribution-Heterogeneous Quantization which enables quantizing them to low-precision. PikeLPN achieves Pareto-optimality in efficiency-accuracy trade-off with up to 3X efficiency improvement compared to SOTA low-precision models.

- **Summary**: Occlusion remains one of the major challenges in person reidentification (ReID) as a result of the diversity of poses and the variation of appearances. Developing novel architectures to improve the robustness of occlusion-aware person Re-ID requires new insights, especially on low-resolution edge cameras. We propose a deep ensemble model that harnesses both CNN and Transformer architectures to generate robust feature representations. To achieve robust Re-ID without the need to manually label occluded regions, we propose to take an ensemble learning-based approach derived from the analogy between arbitrarily shaped occluded regions and robust feature representation. Using the orthogonality principle, our developed deep CNN model makes use of masked autoencoder (MAE) and global-local feature fusion for robust person identification. Furthermore, we present a part occlusion-aware transformer capable of learning feature space that is robust to occluded regions. Experimental results are reported on several Re-ID datasets to show the effectiveness of our developed ensemble model named orthogonal fusion with occlusion handling (OFOH). Compared to competing methods, the proposed OFOH approach has achieved competent rank-1 and mAP performance.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have enabled photorealistic image generation with high quality. However, the malicious use of such generated media has raised concerns regarding visual misinformation. Although deepfake detection research has demonstrated high accuracy, it is vulnerable to advances in generation techniques and adversarial iterations on detection countermeasures. To address this, we propose a proactive and sustainable deepfake training augmentation solution that introduces artificial fingerprints into models. We achieve this by employing an ensemble learning approach that incorporates a pool of autoencoders that mimic the effect of the artefacts introduced by the deepfake generator models. Experiments on three datasets reveal that our proposed ensemble autoencoder-based data augmentation learning approach offers improvements in terms of generalisation, resistance against basic data perturbations such as noise, blurring, sharpness enhancement, and affine transforms, resilience to commonly used lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG, and enhanced resistance against adversarial attacks.

- **Summary**: In the past decades, deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of medical image segmentation tasks. Recently, the introduction of the vision transformer (ViT) has significantly altered the landscape of deep segmentation models. There has been a growing focus on ViTs, driven by their excellent performance and scalability. However, we argue that the current design of the vision transformer-based UNet (ViT-UNet) segmentation models may not effectively handle the heterogeneous appearance (e.g., varying shapes and sizes) of objects of interest in medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present a structured approach to introduce spatially dynamic components to the ViT-UNet. This adaptation enables the model to effectively capture features of target objects with diverse appearances. This is achieved by three main components: \textbf{(i)} deformable patch embedding; \textbf{(ii)} spatially dynamic multi-head attention; \textbf{(iii)} deformable positional encoding. These components were integrated into a novel architecture, termed AgileFormer. AgileFormer is a spatially agile ViT-UNet designed for medical image segmentation. Experiments in three segmentation tasks using publicly available datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Instance segmentation of neurons in volumetric light microscopy images of nervous systems enables groundbreaking research in neuroscience by facilitating joint functional and morphological analyses of neural circuits at cellular resolution. Yet said multi-neuron light microscopy data exhibits extremely challenging properties for the task of instance segmentation: Individual neurons have long-ranging, thin filamentous and widely branching morphologies, multiple neurons are tightly inter-weaved, and partial volume effects, uneven illumination and noise inherent to light microscopy severely impede local disentangling as well as long-range tracing of individual neurons. These properties reflect a current key challenge in machine learning research, namely to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the data. While respective methodological research is buzzing, to date methods are typically benchmarked on synthetic datasets. To address this gap, we release the FlyLight Instance Segmentation Benchmark (FISBe) dataset, the first publicly available multi-neuron light microscopy dataset with pixel-wise annotations. In addition, we define a set of instance segmentation metrics for benchmarking that we designed to be meaningful with regard to downstream analyses. Lastly, we provide three baselines to kick off a competition that we envision to both advance the field of machine learning regarding methodology for capturing long-range data dependencies, and facilitate scientific discovery in basic neuroscience.

- **Summary**: The quality of fetal MRI is significantly affected by unpredictable and substantial fetal motion, leading to the introduction of artifacts even when fast acquisition sequences are employed. The development of 3D real-time fetal pose estimation approaches on volumetric EPI fetal MRI opens up a promising avenue for fetal motion monitoring and prediction. Challenges arise in fetal pose estimation due to limited number of real scanned fetal MR training images, hindering model generalization when the acquired fetal MRI lacks adequate pose.   In this study, we introduce FetalDiffusion, a novel approach utilizing a conditional diffusion model to generate 3D synthetic fetal MRI with controllable pose. Additionally, an auxiliary pose-level loss is adopted to enhance model performance. Our work demonstrates the success of this proposed model by producing high-quality synthetic fetal MRI images with accurate and recognizable fetal poses, comparing favorably with in-vivo real fetal MRI. Furthermore, we show that the integration of synthetic fetal MR images enhances the fetal pose estimation model's performance, particularly when the number of available real scanned data is limited resulting in 15.4% increase in PCK and 50.2% reduced in mean error. All experiments are done on a single 32GB V100 GPU. Our method holds promise for improving real-time tracking models, thereby addressing fetal motion issues more effectively.

- **Summary**: Both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and sMRI) are widely used for the diagnosis of mental disorder. However, combining complementary information from these two modalities is challenging due to their heterogeneity. Many existing methods fall short of capturing the interaction between these modalities, frequently defaulting to a simple combination of latent features. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Attentive Multi-modal Fusion framework (CAMF), which aims to capture both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships between fMRI and sMRI, enhancing multi-modal data representation. Specifically, our CAMF framework employs self-attention modules to identify interactions within each modality while cross-attention modules identify interactions between modalities. Subsequently, our approach optimizes the integration of latent features from both modalities. This approach significantly improves classification accuracy, as demonstrated by our evaluations on two extensive multi-modal brain imaging datasets, where CAMF consistently outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, the gradient-guided Score-CAM is applied to interpret critical functional networks and brain regions involved in schizophrenia. The bio-markers identified by CAMF align with established research, potentially offering new insights into the diagnosis and pathological endophenotypes of schizophrenia.

- **Summary**: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) has been a powerful method in sparse signal recovery and approximation. However OMP suffers computational issue when the signal has large number of non-zeros. This paper advances OMP in two fronts: it offers a fast algorithm for the orthogonal projection of the input signal at each iteration, and a new selection criterion for making the greedy choice, which reduces the number of iterations it takes to recover the signal. The proposed modifications to OMP directly reduce the computational complexity. Experiment results show significant improvement over the classical OMP in computation time. The paper also provided a sufficient condition for exact recovery under the new greedy choice criterion. For general signals that may not have sparse representations, the paper provides a bound for the approximation error. The approximation error is at the same order as OMP but is obtained within fewer iterations and less time.



### VSRD: Instance-Aware Volumetric Silhouette Rendering for Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection poses a significant challenge in 3D scene understanding due to its inherently ill-posed nature in monocular depth estimation. Existing methods heavily rely on supervised learning using abundant 3D labels, typically obtained through expensive and labor-intensive annotation on LiDAR point clouds. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel weakly supervised 3D object detection framework named VSRD (Volumetric Silhouette Rendering for Detection) to train 3D object detectors without any 3D supervision but only weak 2D supervision. VSRD consists of multi-view 3D auto-labeling and subsequent training of monocular 3D object detectors using the pseudo labels generated in the auto-labeling stage. In the auto-labeling stage, we represent the surface of each instance as a signed distance field (SDF) and render its silhouette as an instance mask through our proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To directly optimize the 3D bounding boxes through rendering, we decompose the SDF of each instance into the SDF of a cuboid and the residual distance field (RDF) that represents the residual from the cuboid. This mechanism enables us to optimize the 3D bounding boxes in an end-to-end manner by comparing the rendered instance masks with the ground truth instance masks. The optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as effective training data for 3D object detection. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset, demonstrating that our method outperforms the existing weakly supervised 3D object detection methods.

### CT respiratory motion synthesis using joint supervised and adversarial learning

- **Summary**: Objective: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) imaging consists in reconstructing a CT acquisition into multiple phases to track internal organ and tumor motion. It is commonly used in radiotherapy treatment planning to establish planning target volumes. However, 4DCT increases protocol complexity, may not align with patient breathing during treatment, and lead to higher radiation delivery. Approach: In this study, we propose a deep synthesis method to generate pseudo respiratory CT phases from static images for motion-aware treatment planning. The model produces patient-specific deformation vector fields (DVFs) by conditioning synthesis on external patient surface-based estimation, mimicking respiratory monitoring devices. A key methodological contribution is to encourage DVF realism through supervised DVF training while using an adversarial term jointly not only on the warped image but also on the magnitude of the DVF itself. This way, we avoid excessive smoothness typically obtained through deep unsupervised learning, and encourage correlations with the respiratory amplitude. Main results: Performance is evaluated using real 4DCT acquisitions with smaller tumor volumes than previously reported. Results demonstrate for the first time that the generated pseudo-respiratory CT phases can capture organ and tumor motion with similar accuracy to repeated 4DCT scans of the same patient. Mean inter-scans tumor center-of-mass distances and Dice similarity coefficients were $1.97$mm and $0.63$, respectively, for real 4DCT phases and $2.35$mm and $0.71$ for synthetic phases, and compares favorably to a state-of-the-art technique (RMSim).

- **Summary**: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) possessing increasingly impressive capabilities, a number of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed to augment LLMs with visual inputs. Such models condition generated text on both an input image and a text prompt, enabling a variety of use cases such as visual question answering and multimodal chat. While prior studies have examined the social biases contained in text generated by LLMs, this topic has been relatively unexplored in LVLMs. Examining social biases in LVLMs is particularly challenging due to the confounding contributions of bias induced by information contained across the text and visual modalities. To address this challenging problem, we conduct a large-scale study of text generated by different LVLMs under counterfactual changes to input images. Specifically, we present LVLMs with identical open-ended text prompts while conditioning on images from different counterfactual sets, where each set contains images which are largely identical in their depiction of a common subject (e.g., a doctor), but vary only in terms of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race and gender). We comprehensively evaluate the text produced by different LVLMs under this counterfactual generation setting and find that social attributes such as race, gender, and physical characteristics depicted in input images can significantly influence toxicity and the generation of competency-associated words.

- **Summary**: We estimate the radiance field of large-scale dynamic areas from multiple vehicle captures under varying environmental conditions. Previous works in this domain are either restricted to static environments, do not scale to more than a single short video, or struggle to separately represent dynamic object instances. To this end, we present a novel, decomposable radiance field approach for dynamic urban environments. We propose a multi-level neural scene graph representation that scales to thousands of images from dozens of sequences with hundreds of fast-moving objects. To enable efficient training and rendering of our representation, we develop a fast composite ray sampling and rendering scheme. To test our approach in urban driving scenarios, we introduce a new, novel view synthesis benchmark. We show that our approach outperforms prior art by a significant margin on both established and our proposed benchmark while being faster in training and rendering.

- **Summary**: This paper proposes and evaluates, for the first time, a top-down (dorsal view), depth-only deep learning system for accurately identifying individual cattle and provides associated code, datasets, and training weights for immediate reproducibility. An increase in herd size skews the cow-to-human ratio at the farm and makes the manual monitoring of individuals more challenging. Therefore, real-time cattle identification is essential for the farms and a crucial step towards precision livestock farming. Underpinned by our previous work, this paper introduces a deep-metric learning method for cattle identification using depth data from an off-the-shelf 3D camera. The method relies on CNN and MLP backbones that learn well-generalised embedding spaces from the body shape to differentiate individuals -- requiring neither species-specific coat patterns nor close-up muzzle prints for operation. The network embeddings are clustered using a simple algorithm such as $k$-NN for highly accurate identification, thus eliminating the need to retrain the network for enrolling new individuals. We evaluate two backbone architectures, ResNet, as previously used to identify Holstein Friesians using RGB images, and PointNet, which is specialised to operate on 3D point clouds. We also present CowDepth2023, a new dataset containing 21,490 synchronised colour-depth image pairs of 99 cows, to evaluate the backbones. Both ResNet and PointNet architectures, which consume depth maps and point clouds, respectively, led to high accuracy that is on par with the coat pattern-based backbone.

- **Summary**: The goal of field boundary delineation is to predict the polygonal boundaries and interiors of individual crop fields in overhead remotely sensed images (e.g., from satellites or drones). Automatic delineation of field boundaries is a necessary task for many real-world use cases in agriculture, such as estimating cultivated area in a region or predicting end-of-season yield in a field. Field boundary delineation can be framed as an instance segmentation problem, but presents unique research challenges compared to traditional computer vision datasets used for instance segmentation. The practical applicability of previous work is also limited by the assumption that a sufficiently-large labeled dataset is available where field boundary delineation models will be applied, which is not the reality for most regions (especially under-resourced regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa). We present an approach for segmentation of crop field boundaries in satellite images in regions lacking labeled data that uses multi-region transfer learning to adapt model weights for the target region. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods and that multi-region transfer learning substantially boosts performance for multiple model architectures. Our implementation and datasets are publicly available to enable use of the approach by end-users and serve as a benchmark for future work.

- **Summary**: Current Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which alter their predictions by adding carefully crafted noise. Since human eyes are robust to such inputs, it is possible that the vulnerability stems from the standard way of processing inputs in one shot by processing every pixel with the same importance. In contrast, neuroscience suggests that the human vision system can differentiate salient features by (1) switching between multiple fixation points (saccades) and (2) processing the surrounding with a non-uniform external resolution (foveation). In this work, we advocate that the integration of such active vision mechanisms into current deep learning systems can offer robustness benefits. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the inherent robustness of two active vision methods - GFNet and FALcon - under a black box threat model. By learning and inferencing based on downsampled glimpses obtained from multiple distinct fixation points within an input, we show that these active methods achieve (2-3) times greater robustness compared to a standard passive convolutional network under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. More importantly, we provide illustrative and interpretable visualization analysis that demonstrates how performing inference from distinct fixation points makes active vision methods less vulnerable to malicious inputs.

- **Summary**: This research project investigates the application of several computer vision techniques for playing card detection and recognition in the context of the popular casino game, blackjack. The primary objective is to develop a robust system that is capable of detecting and accurately classifying playing cards in real-time, and displaying the optimal move recommendation based on the given image of the current game. The proposed methodology involves using K-Means for image segmentation, card reprojection and feature extraction, training of the KNN classifier using a labeled dataset, and integration of the detection system into a Blackjack Basic Strategy recommendation algorithm. Further, the study aims to observe the effectiveness of this approach in detecting various card designs under different lighting conditions and occlusions. Overall, the project examines the potential benefits of incorporating computer vision techniques, with a specific focus on card detection, into commonly played games aiming to enhance player decision-making and optimize strategic outcomes. The results obtained from our experimental evaluations with models developed under considerable time constraints, highlight the potential for practical implementation in real-world casino environments and across other similarly structured games.

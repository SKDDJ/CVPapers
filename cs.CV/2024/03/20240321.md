- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on various computer vision tasks. However, their high computational complexity prevents them from being applied to many real-world applications. Weight and token pruning are two well-known methods for reducing complexity: weight pruning reduces the model size and associated computational demands, while token pruning further dynamically reduces the computation based on the input. Combining these two techniques should significantly reduce computation complexity and model size; however, naively integrating them results in irregular computation patterns, leading to significant accuracy drops and difficulties in hardware acceleration.   Addressing the above challenges, we propose a comprehensive algorithm-hardware codesign for accelerating ViT on FPGA through simultaneous pruning -combining static weight pruning and dynamic token pruning. For algorithm design, we systematically combine a hardware-aware structured block-pruning method for pruning model parameters and a dynamic token pruning method for removing unimportant token vectors. Moreover, we design a novel training algorithm to recover the model's accuracy. For hardware design, we develop a novel hardware accelerator for executing the pruned model. The proposed hardware design employs multi-level parallelism with load balancing strategy to efficiently deal with the irregular computation pattern led by the two pruning approaches. Moreover, we develop an efficient hardware mechanism for efficiently executing the on-the-fly token pruning.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) accomplishes photo-realistic novel view synthesis by learning the implicit volumetric representation of a scene from multi-view images, which faithfully convey the colorimetric information. However, sensor noises will contaminate low-value pixel signals, and the lossy camera image signal processor will further remove near-zero intensities in extremely dark situations, deteriorating the synthesis performance. Existing approaches reconstruct low-light scenes from raw images but struggle to recover texture and boundary details in dark regions. Additionally, they are unsuitable for high-speed models relying on explicit representations. To address these issues, we present Thermal-NeRF, which takes thermal and visible raw images as inputs, considering the thermal camera is robust to the illumination variation and raw images preserve any possible clues in the dark, to accomplish visible and thermal view synthesis simultaneously. Also, the first multi-view thermal and visible dataset (MVTV) is established to support the research on multimodal NeRF. Thermal-NeRF achieves the best trade-off between detail preservation and noise smoothing and provides better synthesis performance than previous work. Finally, we demonstrate that both modalities are beneficial to each other in 3D reconstruction.

- **Summary**: We present a new method to automatically generate semantic segmentation annotations for thermal imagery captured from an aerial vehicle by utilizing satellite-derived data products alongside onboard global positioning and attitude estimates. This new capability overcomes the challenge of developing thermal semantic perception algorithms for field robots due to the lack of annotated thermal field datasets and the time and costs of manual annotation, enabling precise and rapid annotation of thermal data from field collection efforts at a massively-parallelizable scale. By incorporating a thermal-conditioned refinement step with visual foundation models, our approach can produce highly-precise semantic segmentation labels using low-resolution satellite land cover data for little-to-no cost. It achieves 98.5% of the performance from using costly high-resolution options and demonstrates between 70-160% improvement over popular zero-shot semantic segmentation methods based on large vision-language models currently used for generating annotations for RGB imagery.

- **Summary**: Data generated in clinical practice often exhibits biases, such as long-tail imbalance and algorithmic unfairness. This study aims to mitigate these challenges through data synthesis. Previous efforts in medical imaging synthesis have struggled with separating lesion information from background context, leading to difficulties in generating high-quality backgrounds and limited control over the synthetic output. Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, lesion-focused diffusion models. By redesigning the diffusion learning objectives to concentrate on lesion areas, it simplifies the model learning process and enhance the controllability of the synthetic output, while preserving background by integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. Furthermore, we generalize it to jointly handle multi-class lesions, and further introduce a generative model for lesion masks to increase synthesis diversity. Validated on the DE-MRI cardiac lesion segmentation dataset (Emidec), our methodology employs the popular nnUNet to demonstrate that the synthetic data make it possible to effectively enhance a state-of-the-art model. Code and model are available at https://github.com/M3DV/LeFusion.

- **Summary**: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) dipole inversion is an ill-posed inverse problem for quantifying magnetic susceptibility distributions from MRI tissue phases. While supervised deep learning methods have shown success in specific QSM tasks, their generalizability across different acquisition scenarios remains constrained. Recent developments in diffusion models have demonstrated potential for solving 2D medical imaging inverse problems. However, their application to 3D modalities, such as QSM, remains challenging due to high computational demands. In this work, we developed a 3D image patch-based diffusion model, namely QSMDiff, for robust QSM reconstruction across different scan parameters, alongside simultaneous super-resolution and image-denoising tasks. QSMDiff adopts unsupervised 3D image patch training and full-size measurement guidance during inference for controlled image generation. Evaluation on simulated and in-vivo human brains, using gradient-echo and echo-planar imaging sequences across different acquisition parameters, demonstrates superior performance. The method proposed in QSMDiff also holds promise for impacting other 3D medical imaging applications beyond QSM.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we make the first attempt at achieving the cross-modal (i.e., image-to-events) adaptation for event-based object recognition without accessing any labeled source image data owning to privacy and commercial issues. Tackling this novel problem is non-trivial due to the novelty of event cameras and the distinct modality gap between images and events. In particular, as only the source model is available, a hurdle is how to extract the knowledge from the source model by only using the unlabeled target event data while achieving knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a novel framework, dubbed EventDance for this unsupervised source-free cross-modal adaptation problem. Importantly, inspired by event-to-video reconstruction methods, we propose a reconstruction-based modality bridging (RMB) module, which reconstructs intensity frames from events in a self-supervised manner. This makes it possible to build up the surrogate images to extract the knowledge (i.e., labels) from the source model. We then propose a multi-representation knowledge adaptation (MKA) module that transfers the knowledge to target models learning events with multiple representation types for fully exploring the spatiotemporal information of events. The two modules connecting the source and target models are mutually updated so as to achieve the best performance. Experiments on three benchmark datasets with two adaption settings show that EventDance is on par with prior methods utilizing the source data.

- **Summary**: Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a crucial task in the fields of computer vision and computer graphics. SDF-based methods excel at reconstructing smooth meshes with minimal error and artifacts but struggle with representing open surfaces. On the other hand, UDF-based methods can effectively represent open surfaces but often introduce noise near the surface, leading to artifacts in the mesh. In this work, we propose a novel approach that directly predicts the intersection points between sampled line segments of point pairs and implicit surfaces. This method not only preserves the ability to represent open surfaces but also eliminates artifacts in the mesh. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three datasets: ShapeNet, MGN, and ScanNet. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the process of separating a natural image into albedo and shade without these ground truths. A recent model employing light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity demonstrated impressive performance, though the necessity of LiDAR intensity during inference restricts its practicality. Thus, IID models employing only a single image during inference while keeping as high IID quality as the one with an image plus LiDAR intensity are highly desired. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that utilizes only an image during inference while utilizing an image and LiDAR intensity during training. Specifically, we introduce a partially-shared model that accepts an image and LiDAR intensity individually using a different specific encoder but processes them together in specific components to learn shared representations. In addition, to enhance IID quality, we propose albedo-alignment loss and image-LiDAR conversion (ILC) paths. Albedo-alignment loss aligns the gray-scale albedo from an image to that inferred from LiDAR intensity, thereby reducing cast shadows in albedo from an image due to the absence of cast shadows in LiDAR intensity. Furthermore, to translate the input image into albedo and shade style while keeping the image contents, the input image is separated into style code and content code by encoders. The ILC path mutually translates the image and LiDAR intensity, which share content but differ in style, contributing to the distinct differentiation of style from content. Consequently, LIET achieves comparable IID quality to the existing model with LiDAR intensity, while utilizing only an image without LiDAR intensity during inference.

- **Summary**: The expanding role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diverse engineering domains highlights the challenges associated with deploying AI models in new operational environments, involving substantial investments in data collection and model training. Rapid application of AI necessitates evaluating the feasibility of utilizing pre-trained models in unobserved operational settings with minimal or no additional data. However, interpreting the opaque nature of AI's black-box models remains a persistent challenge. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a science-based certification methodology to assess the viability of employing pre-trained data-driven models in untrained operational environments. The methodology advocates a profound integration of domain knowledge, leveraging theoretical and analytical models from physics and related disciplines, with data-driven AI models. This novel approach introduces tools to facilitate the development of secure engineering systems, providing decision-makers with confidence in the trustworthiness and safety of AI-based models across diverse environments characterized by limited training data and dynamic, uncertain conditions. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this methodology in real-world safety-critical scenarios, particularly in the context of traffic state estimation. Through simulation results, the study illustrates how the proposed methodology efficiently quantifies physical inconsistencies exhibited by pre-trained AI models. By utilizing analytical models, the methodology offers a means to gauge the applicability of pre-trained AI models in new operational environments. This research contributes to advancing the understanding and deployment of AI models, offering a robust certification framework that enhances confidence in their reliability and safety across a spectrum of operational conditions.



### Text-Enhanced Data-free Approach for Federated Class-Incremental Learning

- **Summary**: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) is an underexplored yet pivotal issue, involving the dynamic addition of new classes in the context of federated learning. In this field, Data-Free Knowledge Transfer (DFKT) plays a crucial role in addressing catastrophic forgetting and data privacy problems. However, prior approaches lack the crucial synergy between DFKT and the model training phases, causing DFKT to encounter difficulties in generating high-quality data from a non-anchored latent space of the old task model. In this paper, we introduce LANDER (Label Text Centered Data-Free Knowledge Transfer) to address this issue by utilizing label text embeddings (LTE) produced by pretrained language models. Specifically, during the model training phase, our approach treats LTE as anchor points and constrains the feature embeddings of corresponding training samples around them, enriching the surrounding area with more meaningful information. In the DFKT phase, by using these LTE anchors, LANDER can synthesize more meaningful samples, thereby effectively addressing the forgetting problem. Additionally, instead of tightly constraining embeddings toward the anchor, the Bounding Loss is introduced to encourage sample embeddings to remain flexible within a defined radius. This approach preserves the natural differences in sample embeddings and mitigates the embedding overlap caused by heterogeneous federated settings. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet demonstrate that LANDER significantly outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in FCIL.

### MaskSAM: Towards Auto-prompt SAM with Mask Classification for Medical Image Segmentation

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Model~(SAM), a prompt-driven foundation model for natural image segmentation, has demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, SAM does not work when directly applied to medical image segmentation tasks, since SAM lacks the functionality to predict semantic labels for predicted masks and needs to provide extra prompts, such as points or boxes, to segment target regions. Meanwhile, there is a huge gap between 2D natural images and 3D medical images, so the performance of SAM is imperfect for medical image segmentation tasks. Following the above issues, we propose MaskSAM, a novel mask classification prompt-free SAM adaptation framework for medical image segmentation. We design a prompt generator combined with the image encoder in SAM to generate a set of auxiliary classifier tokens, auxiliary binary masks, and auxiliary bounding boxes. Each pair of auxiliary mask and box prompts, which can solve the requirements of extra prompts, is associated with class label predictions by the sum of the auxiliary classifier token and the learnable global classifier tokens in the mask decoder of SAM to solve the predictions of semantic labels. Meanwhile, we design a 3D depth-convolution adapter for image embeddings and a 3D depth-MLP adapter for prompt embeddings. We inject one of them into each transformer block in the image encoder and mask decoder to enable pre-trained 2D SAM models to extract 3D information and adapt to 3D medical images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMOS2022, 90.52% Dice, which improved by 2.7% compared to nnUNet. Our method surpasses nnUNet by 1.7% on ACDC and 1.0% on Synapse datasets.



### Existence Is Chaos: Enhancing 3D Human Motion Prediction with Uncertainty Consideration

- **Summary**: Human motion prediction is consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. It is a longstanding challenge due to motion's complex dynamics and uncertainty. Existing methods focus on building up complicated neural networks to model the motion dynamics. The predicted results are required to be strictly similar to the training samples with L2 loss in current training pipeline. However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty property which is crucial to the prediction task. We argue that the recorded motion in training data could be an observation of possible future, rather than a predetermined result. In addition, existing works calculate the predicted error on each future frame equally during training, while recent work indicated that different frames could play different roles. In this work, a novel computationally efficient encoder-decoder model with uncertainty consideration is proposed, which could learn proper characteristics for future frames by a dynamic function. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our uncertainty consideration approach has obvious advantages both in quantity and quality. Moreover, the proposed method could produce motion sequences with much better quality that avoids the intractable shaking artefacts. We believe our work could provide a novel perspective to consider the uncertainty quality for the general motion prediction task and encourage the studies in this field. The code will be available in https://github.com/Motionpre/Adaptive-Salient-Loss-SAGGB.

- **Summary**: Panoramic Activity Recognition (PAR) seeks to identify diverse human activities across different scales, from individual actions to social group and global activities in crowded panoramic scenes. PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.



### Test-time Similarity Modification for Person Re-identification toward Temporal Distribution Shift

- **Summary**: Person re-identification (re-id), which aims to retrieve images of the same person in a given image from a database, is one of the most practical image recognition applications. In the real world, however, the environments that the images are taken from change over time. This causes a distribution shift between training and testing and degrades the performance of re-id. To maintain re-id performance, models should continue adapting to the test environment's temporal changes. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which aims to adapt models to the test environment with only unlabeled test data, is a promising way to handle this problem because TTA can adapt models instantly in the test environment. However, the previous TTA methods are designed for classification and cannot be directly applied to re-id. This is because the set of people's identities in the dataset differs between training and testing in re-id, whereas the set of classes is fixed in the current TTA methods designed for classification. To improve re-id performance in changing test environments, we propose TEst-time similarity Modification for Person re-identification (TEMP), a novel TTA method for re-id. TEMP is the first fully TTA method for re-id, which does not require any modification to pre-training. Inspired by TTA methods that refine the prediction uncertainty in classification, we aim to refine the uncertainty in re-id. However, the uncertainty cannot be computed in the same way as classification in re-id since it is an open-set task, which does not share person labels between training and testing. Hence, we propose re-id entropy, an alternative uncertainty measure for re-id computed based on the similarity between the feature vectors. Experiments show that the re-id entropy can measure the uncertainty on re-id and TEMP improves the performance of re-id in online settings where the distribution changes over time.

- **Summary**: Remote sensing through unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been increasing in forestry in recent years, along with using machine learning for data processing. Deep learning architectures, extensively applied in natural language and image processing, have recently been extended to the point cloud domain. However, the availability of point cloud datasets for training and testing remains limited. Creating forested environment point cloud datasets is expensive, requires high-precision sensors, and is time-consuming as manual point classification is required. Moreover, forest areas could be inaccessible or dangerous for humans, further complicating data collection. Then, a question arises whether it is possible to use synthetic data to train deep learning networks without the need to rely on large volumes of real forest data. To answer this question, we developed a realistic simulator that procedurally generates synthetic forest scenes. Thanks to this, we have conducted a comparative study of different state-of-the-art point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation. Using created datasets, we determined the feasibility of using synthetic data to train deep learning networks to classify point clouds from real forest datasets. Both the simulator and the datasets are released as part of this work.

- **Summary**: In deep learning, test-time adaptation has gained attention as a method for model fine-tuning without the need for labeled data. A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration-a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning without needing labeled data.

- **Summary**: Generating realistic 3D scenes is challenging due to the complexity of room layouts and object geometries.We propose a sketch based knowledge enhanced diffusion architecture (SEK) for generating customized, diverse, and plausible 3D scenes. SEK conditions the denoising process with a hand-drawn sketch of the target scene and cues from an object relationship knowledge base. We first construct an external knowledge base containing object relationships and then leverage knowledge enhanced graph reasoning to assist our model in understanding hand-drawn sketches. A scene is represented as a combination of 3D objects and their relationships, and then incrementally diffused to reach a Gaussian distribution.We propose a 3D denoising scene transformer that learns to reverse the diffusion process, conditioned by a hand-drawn sketch along with knowledge cues, to regressively generate the scene including the 3D object instances as well as their layout. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that our model improves FID, CKL by 17.41%, 37.18% in 3D scene generation and FID, KID by 19.12%, 20.06% in 3D scene completion compared to the nearest competitor DiffuScene.

- **Summary**: Point cloud processing methods leverage local and global point features %at the feature level to cater to downstream tasks, yet they often overlook the task-level context inherent in point clouds during the encoding stage. We argue that integrating task-level information into the encoding stage significantly enhances performance. To that end, we propose SMTransformer which incorporates task-level information into a vector-based transformer by utilizing a soft mask generated from task-level queries and keys to learn the attention weights. Additionally, to facilitate effective communication between features from the encoding and decoding layers in high-level tasks such as segmentation, we introduce a skip-attention-based up-sampling block. This block dynamically fuses features from various resolution points across the encoding and decoding layers. To mitigate the increase in network parameters and training time resulting from the complexity of the aforementioned blocks, we propose a novel shared position encoding strategy. This strategy allows various transformer blocks to share the same position information over the same resolution points, thereby reducing network parameters and training time without compromising accuracy.Experimental comparisons with existing methods on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of SMTransformer and skip-attention-based up-sampling for point cloud processing tasks, including semantic segmentation and classification. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results of 73.4% mIoU on S3DIS Area 5 and 62.4% mIoU on SWAN dataset

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is a fundamental task in scene understanding. Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to better incorporate Hough voting into the 3D object detection pipeline. However, due to the noisy, cluttered, and partial nature of real 3D scans, existing voting-based methods often receive votes from the partial surfaces of individual objects together with severe noises, leading to sub-optimal detection performance. In this work, we focus on the distributional properties of point clouds and formulate the voting process as generating new points in the high-density region of the distribution of object centers. To achieve this, we propose a new method to move random 3D points toward the high-density region of the distribution by estimating the score function of the distribution with a noise conditioned score network. Specifically, we first generate a set of object center proposals to coarsely identify the high-density region of the object center distribution. To estimate the score function, we perturb the generated object center proposals by adding normalized Gaussian noise, and then jointly estimate the score function of all perturbed distributions. Finally, we generate new votes by moving random 3D points to the high-density region of the object center distribution according to the estimated score function. Extensive experiments on two large scale indoor 3D scene datasets, SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: Image compression and denoising represent fundamental challenges in image processing with many real-world applications. To address practical demands, current solutions can be categorized into two main strategies: 1) sequential method; and 2) joint method. However, sequential methods have the disadvantage of error accumulation as there is information loss between multiple individual models. Recently, the academic community began to make some attempts to tackle this problem through end-to-end joint methods. Most of them ignore that different regions of noisy images have different characteristics. To solve these problems, in this paper, our proposed signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) aware joint solution exploits local and non-local features for image compression and denoising simultaneously. We design an end-to-end trainable network, which includes the main encoder branch, the guidance branch, and the signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) aware branch. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our joint solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: MixUp and its variants, such as Manifold MixUp, have two key limitations in image classification tasks. First, they often neglect mixing within the same class (intra-class mixup), leading to an underutilization of the relationships among samples within the same class. Second, although these methods effectively enhance inter-class separability by mixing between different classes (inter-class mixup), they fall short in improving intra-class cohesion through their mixing operations, limiting their classification performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel mixup method and a comprehensive integrated solution.Our mixup approach specifically targets intra-class mixup, an aspect commonly overlooked, to strengthen intra-class cohesion-a feature not provided by current mixup techniques.For each mini-batch, our method utilizes feature representations of unaugmented original images from each class within the mini-batch to generate a single synthesized feature representation through random linear interpolation. All synthesized representations for this mini-batch are then fed into the classification and loss layers to calculate an average classification loss that can markedly enhance intra-class cohesion. Moreover, our integrated solution seamlessly combines our intra-class mixup method with an existing mixup approach such as MixUp or Manifold MixUp. This comprehensive solution incorporates inter- and intra-class mixup in a balanced manner while concurrently improving intra-class cohesion and inter-class separability. Experimental results on six public datasets demonstrate that our integrated solution achieves a 0.1% to 3.43% higher accuracy than the best of either MixUp or our intra-class mixup method, averaging a 1.16% gain. It also outperforms the better performer of either Manifold MixUp or our intra-class mixup method by 0.12% to 5.16%, with an average gain of 1.11%.

- **Summary**: Robotic mapping with Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) has shown promise in creating semantic maps by effectively leveraging local spatial information. However, existing semantic mapping methods face challenges in constructing reliable maps in unstructured outdoor scenarios due to unreliable semantic predictions. To address this issue, we propose an evidential semantic mapping, which can enhance reliability in perceptually challenging off-road environments. We integrate Evidential Deep Learning into the semantic segmentation network to obtain the uncertainty estimate of semantic prediction. Subsequently, this semantic uncertainty is incorporated into an uncertainty-aware BKI, tailored to prioritize more confident semantic predictions when accumulating semantic information. By adaptively handling semantic uncertainties, the proposed framework constructs robust representations of the surroundings even in previously unseen environments. Comprehensive experiments across various off-road datasets demonstrate that our framework enhances accuracy and robustness, consistently outperforming existing methods in scenes with high perceptual uncertainties.

- **Summary**: Biased attributes, spuriously correlated with target labels in a dataset, can problematically lead to neural networks that learn improper shortcuts for classifications and limit their capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Although many debiasing approaches have been proposed to ensure correct predictions from biased datasets, few studies have considered learning latent embedding consisting of intrinsic and biased attributes that contribute to improved performance and explain how the model pays attention to attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel debiasing framework, Debiasing Global Workspace, introducing attention-based information bottlenecks for learning compositional representations of attributes without defining specific bias types. Based on our observation that learning shape-centric representation helps robust performance on OOD datasets, we adopt those abilities to learn robust and generalizable representations of decomposable latent embeddings corresponding to intrinsic and biasing attributes. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on biased datasets, along with both quantitative and qualitative analyses, to showcase our approach's efficacy in attribute-centric representation learning and its ability to differentiate between intrinsic and bias-related features.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can understand image-language prompts and demonstrate impressive reasoning ability. In this paper, we extend MLLMs' output by empowering MLLMs with the segmentation ability. The extended MLLMs can both output language responses to the image-language prompts and segment the regions that the complex question or query in the language prompts focuses on. To this end, the existing work, LISA, enlarges the original word embeddings with an additional segment token and fine-tunes dialogue generation and query-focused segmentation together, where the feature of the segment token is used to prompt the segment-anything model. Although they achieve superior segmentation performance, we observe that the dialogue ability decreases by a large margin compared to the original MLLMs. To maintain the original MLLMs' dialogue ability, we propose a novel MLLMs framework, coined as LLaVASeg, which leverages a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to instruct the MLLMs to segment the target region queried by the user. The MLLMs are first prompted to reason about the simple description of the target region from the complicated user query, then extract the visual attributes of the target region according to the understanding of MLLMs to the image. These visual attributes, such as color and relative locations, are utilized to prompt the downstream segmentation model. Experiments show that the proposed method keeps the original dialogue ability and equips the MLLMs' model with strong reasoning segmentation ability.

- **Summary**: Video diffusion models have recently made great progress in generation quality, but are still limited by the high memory and computational requirements. This is because current video diffusion models often attempt to process high-dimensional videos directly. To tackle this issue, we propose content-motion latent diffusion model (CMD), a novel efficient extension of pretrained image diffusion models for video generation. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder that succinctly encodes a video as a combination of a content frame (like an image) and a low-dimensional motion latent representation. The former represents the common content, and the latter represents the underlying motion in the video, respectively. We generate the content frame by fine-tuning a pretrained image diffusion model, and we generate the motion latent representation by training a new lightweight diffusion model. A key innovation here is the design of a compact latent space that can directly utilizes a pretrained image diffusion model, which has not been done in previous latent video diffusion models. This leads to considerably better quality generation and reduced computational costs. For instance, CMD can sample a video 7.7$\times$ faster than prior approaches by generating a video of 512$\times$1024 resolution and length 16 in 3.1 seconds. Moreover, CMD achieves an FVD score of 212.7 on WebVid-10M, 27.3% better than the previous state-of-the-art of 292.4.

- **Summary**: In a surge of text-to-image (T2I) models and their customization methods that generate new images of a user-provided subject, current works focus on alleviating the costs incurred by a lengthy per-subject optimization. These zero-shot customization methods encode the image of a specified subject into a visual embedding which is then utilized alongside the textual embedding for diffusion guidance. The visual embedding incorporates intrinsic information about the subject, while the textual embedding provides a new, transient context. However, the existing methods often 1) are significantly affected by the input images, eg., generating images with the same pose, and 2) exhibit deterioration in the subject's identity. We first pin down the problem and show that redundant pose information in the visual embedding interferes with the textual embedding containing the desired pose information. To address this issue, we propose orthogonal visual embedding which effectively harmonizes with the given textual embedding. We also adopt the visual-only embedding and inject the subject's clear features utilizing a self-attention swap. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which offers highly flexible zero-shot generation while effectively maintaining the subject's identity.

- **Summary**: Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate through an 3D environment based on visual observations and natural language instructions. It is clear that the pivotal factor for successful navigation lies in the comprehensive scene understanding. Previous VLN agents employ monocular frameworks to extract 2D features of perspective views directly. Though straightforward, they struggle for capturing 3D geometry and semantics, leading to a partial and incomplete environment representation. To achieve a comprehensive 3D representation with fine-grained details, we introduce a Volumetric Environment Representation (VER), which voxelizes the physical world into structured 3D cells. For each cell, VER aggregates multi-view 2D features into such a unified 3D space via 2D-3D sampling. Through coarse-to-fine feature extraction and multi-task learning for VER, our agent predicts 3D occupancy, 3D room layout, and 3D bounding boxes jointly. Based on online collected VERs, our agent performs volume state estimation and builds episodic memory for predicting the next step. Experimental results show our environment representations from multi-task learning lead to evident performance gains on VLN. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R).

- **Summary**: Object-goal navigation is a crucial engineering task for the community of embodied navigation; it involves navigating to an instance of a specified object category within unseen environments. Although extensive investigations have been conducted on both end-to-end and modular-based, data-driven approaches, fully enabling an agent to comprehend the environment through perceptual knowledge and perform object-goal navigation as efficiently as humans remains a significant challenge. Recently, large language models have shown potential in this task, thanks to their powerful capabilities for knowledge extraction and integration. In this study, we propose a data-driven, modular-based approach, trained on a dataset that incorporates common-sense knowledge of object-to-room relationships extracted from a large language model. We utilize the multi-channel Swin-Unet architecture to conduct multi-task learning incorporating with multimodal inputs. The results in the Habitat simulator demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baseline by an average of 10.6% in the efficiency metric, Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). The real-world demonstration shows that the proposed approach can efficiently conduct this task by traversing several rooms.

- **Summary**: In this study, we explore the challenge of efficiently representing scenes with a constrained number of Gaussians. Our analysis shifts from traditional graphics and 2D computer vision to the perspective of point clouds, highlighting the inefficient spatial distribution of Gaussian representation as a key limitation in model performance. To address this, we introduce strategies for densification including blur split and depth reinitialization, and simplification through Gaussian binarization and sampling. These techniques reorganize the spatial positions of the Gaussians, resulting in significant improvements across various datasets and benchmarks in terms of rendering quality, resource consumption, and storage compression. Our proposed Mini-Splatting method integrates seamlessly with the original rasterization pipeline, providing a strong baseline for future research in Gaussian-Splatting-based works.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the activity-silent and persistent activity mechanisms in human visual perception biology, we design a Unified Static and Dynamic Network (UniSDNet), to learn the semantic association between the video and text/audio queries in a cross-modal environment for efficient video grounding. For static modeling, we devise a novel residual structure (ResMLP) to boost the global comprehensive interaction between the video segments and queries, achieving more effective semantic enhancement/supplement. For dynamic modeling, we effectively exploit three characteristics of the persistent activity mechanism in our network design for a better video context comprehension. Specifically, we construct a diffusely connected video clip graph on the basis of 2D sparse temporal masking to reflect the "short-term effect" relationship. We innovatively consider the temporal distance and relevance as the joint "auxiliary evidence clues" and design a multi-kernel Temporal Gaussian Filter to expand the context clue into high-dimensional space, simulating the "complex visual perception", and then conduct element level filtering convolution operations on neighbour clip nodes in message passing stage for finally generating and ranking the candidate proposals. Our UniSDNet is applicable to both Natural Language Video Grounding (NLVG) and Spoken Language Video Grounding (SLVG) tasks. Our UniSDNet achieves SOTA performance on three widely used datasets for NLVG, as well as three datasets for SLVG, e.g., reporting new records at 38.88% R@1,IoU@0.7 on ActivityNet Captions and 40.26% R@1,IoU@0.5 on TACoS. To facilitate this field, we collect two new datasets (Charades-STA Speech and TACoS Speech) for SLVG task. Meanwhile, the inference speed of our UniSDNet is 1.56$\times$ faster than the strong multi-query benchmark. Code is available at: https://github.com/xian-sh/UniSDNet.

- **Summary**: The recent success of CLIP has demonstrated promising results in zero-shot semantic segmentation by transferring muiltimodal knowledge to pixel-level classification. However, leveraging pre-trained CLIP knowledge to closely align text embeddings with pixel embeddings still has limitations in existing approaches. To address this issue, we propose OTSeg, a novel multimodal attention mechanism aimed at enhancing the potential of multiple text prompts for matching associated pixel embeddings. We first propose Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn (MPS) based on the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm, which leads multiple text prompts to selectively focus on various semantic features within image pixels. Moreover, inspired by the success of Sinkformers in unimodal settings, we introduce the extension of MPS, called Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn Attention (MPSA), which effectively replaces cross-attention mechanisms within Transformer framework in multimodal settings. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that OTSeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant gains on Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation (ZS3) tasks across three benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: We propose a method that can generate cinemagraphs automatically from a still landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Inspired by the success of recent unconditional video generation, we leverage a powerful pre-trained image generator to synthesize high-quality cinemagraphs. Unlike previous approaches that mainly utilize the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN, our approach utilizes its deep feature space for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph generation. Specifically, we propose multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW), which warps the intermediate features of a pre-trained StyleGAN at different resolutions. By using MSDFW, the generated cinemagraphs are of high resolution and exhibit plausible looping animation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through user studies and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art cinemagraph generation methods and a video generation method that uses a pre-trained StyleGAN.

- **Summary**: Bolus segmentation is crucial for the automated detection of swallowing disorders in videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS). However, it is difficult for the model to accurately segment a bolus region in a VFSS image because VFSS images are translucent, have low contrast and unclear region boundaries, and lack color information. To overcome these challenges, we propose PECI-Net, a network architecture for VFSS image analysis that combines two novel techniques: the preprocessing ensemble network (PEN) and the cascaded inference network (CIN). PEN enhances the sharpness and contrast of the VFSS image by combining multiple preprocessing algorithms in a learnable way. CIN reduces ambiguity in bolus segmentation by using context from other regions through cascaded inference. Moreover, CIN prevents undesirable side effects from unreliably segmented regions by referring to the context in an asymmetric way. In experiments, PECI-Net exhibited higher performance than four recently developed baseline models, outperforming TernausNet, the best among the baseline models, by 4.54\% and the widely used UNet by 10.83\%. The results of the ablation studies confirm that CIN and PEN are effective in improving bolus segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the effective utilization of unlabeled data for large-area cross-view geo-localization (CVGL), encompassing both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Common approaches to CVGL rely on ground-satellite image pairs and employ label-driven supervised training. However, the cost of collecting precise cross-view image pairs hinders the deployment of CVGL in real-life scenarios. Without the pairs, CVGL will be more challenging to handle the significant imaging and spatial gaps between ground and satellite images. To this end, we propose an unsupervised framework including a cross-view projection to guide the model for retrieving initial pseudo-labels and a fast re-ranking mechanism to refine the pseudo-labels by leveraging the fact that ``the perfectly paired ground-satellite image is located in a unique and identical scene". The framework exhibits competitive performance compared with supervised works on three open-source benchmarks. Our code and models will be released on https://github.com/liguopeng0923/UCVGL.

- **Summary**: Nowadays an ever-growing concerning phenomenon, the emergence of algorithmic biases that can lead to unfair models, emerges. Several debiasing approaches have been proposed in the realm of deep learning, employing more or less sophisticated approaches to discourage these models from massively employing these biases. However, a question emerges: is this extra complexity really necessary? Is a vanilla-trained model already embodying some ``unbiased sub-networks'' that can be used in isolation and propose a solution without relying on the algorithmic biases? In this work, we show that such a sub-network typically exists, and can be extracted from a vanilla-trained model without requiring additional training. We further validate that such specific architecture is incapable of learning a specific bias, suggesting that there are possible architectural countermeasures to the problem of biases in deep neural networks.

- **Summary**: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to identify, at the pixel level, the object in a visual scene that produces a given sound. Current AVS methods rely on costly fine-grained annotations of mask-audio pairs, making them impractical for scalability. To address this, we introduce unsupervised AVS, eliminating the need for such expensive annotation. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose an unsupervised learning method, named Modality Correspondence Alignment (MoCA), which seamlessly integrates off-the-shelf foundation models like DINO, SAM, and ImageBind. This approach leverages their knowledge complementarity and optimizes their joint usage for multi-modality association. Initially, we estimate positive and negative image pairs in the feature space. For pixel-level association, we introduce an audio-visual adapter and a novel pixel matching aggregation strategy within the image-level contrastive learning framework. This allows for a flexible connection between object appearance and audio signal at the pixel level, with tolerance to imaging variations such as translation and rotation. Extensive experiments on the AVSBench (single and multi-object splits) and AVSS datasets demonstrate that our MoCA outperforms strongly designed baseline methods and approaches supervised counterparts, particularly in complex scenarios with multiple auditory objects. Notably when comparing mIoU, MoCA achieves a substantial improvement over baselines in both the AVSBench (S4: +17.24%; MS3: +67.64%) and AVSS (+19.23%) audio-visual segmentation challenges.

- **Summary**: In the context of high usability in single-class anomaly detection models, recent academic research has become concerned about the more complex multi-class anomaly detection. Although several papers have designed unified models for this task, they often overlook the utility of class labels, a potent tool for mitigating inter-class interference. To address this issue, we introduce a Multi-class Implicit Neural representation Transformer for unified Anomaly Detection (MINT-AD), which leverages the fine-grained category information in the training stage. By learning the multi-class distributions, the model generates class-aware query embeddings for the transformer decoder, mitigating inter-class interference within the reconstruction model. Utilizing such an implicit neural representation network, MINT-AD can project category and position information into a feature embedding space, further supervised by classification and prior probability loss functions. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that MINT-AD outperforms existing unified training models.

- **Summary**: Although mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) algorithms perform well in academic datasets, their performance is limited in practical application due to the ideal experimental setting of clean training data. Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom discussed. This paper considers label-level noise in image sensory anomaly detection for the first time. To solve this problem, we proposed a memory-based unsupervised AD method, SoftPatch, which efficiently denoises the data at the patch level. Noise discriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset construction. The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset. Comprehensive experiments in various noise scenes demonstrate that SoftPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art AD methods on the MVTecAD and BTAD benchmarks and is comparable to those methods under the setting without noise.

- **Summary**: We present source detection and catalogue construction pipelines to build the first catalogue of radio galaxies from the 270 $\rm deg^2$ pilot survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU-PS) conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The detection pipeline uses Gal-DINO computer-vision networks (Gupta et al., 2024) to predict the categories of radio morphology and bounding boxes for radio sources, as well as their potential infrared host positions. The Gal-DINO network is trained and evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of predicted host positions are within $3^{\prime \prime}$ of the ground truth infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining 10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I, 5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts for 36% of the radio galaxies.

- **Summary**: Frame-level micro- and macro-expression spotting methods require time-consuming frame-by-frame observation during annotation. Meanwhile, video-level spotting lacks sufficient information about the location and number of expressions during training, resulting in significantly inferior performance compared with fully-supervised spotting. To bridge this gap, we propose a point-level weakly-supervised expression spotting (PWES) framework, where each expression requires to be annotated with only one random frame (i.e., a point). To mitigate the issue of sparse label distribution, the prevailing solution is pseudo-label mining, which, however, introduces new problems: localizing contextual background snippets results in inaccurate boundaries and discarding foreground snippets leads to fragmentary predictions. Therefore, we design the strategies of multi-refined pseudo label generation (MPLG) and distribution-guided feature contrastive learning (DFCL) to address these problems. Specifically, MPLG generates more reliable pseudo labels by merging class-specific probabilities, attention scores, fused features, and point-level labels. DFCL is utilized to enhance feature similarity for the same categories and feature variability for different categories while capturing global representations across the entire datasets. Extensive experiments on the CAS(ME)^2, CAS(ME)^3, and SAMM-LV datasets demonstrate PWES achieves promising performance comparable to that of recent fully-supervised methods.

- **Summary**: The rise of Artificial Intelligence creates great promise in the field of medical discovery, diagnostics and patient management. However, the vast complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately, large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models and sophisticated machine learning tools. This holistic approach achieves a nuanced interpretation of dermatological conditions that simulates and facilitates a dermatologist's workflow. We assess our proposed methodology through a thorough cross-model validation technique embedded in an evaluation pipeline that utilizes publicly available medical case studies of skin conditions and relevant images. To quantitatively score the system performance, advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools are employed which focus on similarity comparison and natural language inference. Additionally, we incorporate a human expert evaluation process based on a structured checklist to further validate our results. We implemented the proposed methodology in a system which achieved approximate (weighted) scores of 0.87 for both contextual understanding and diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing dermatological analysis. The proposed methodology is expected to prove useful in the development of next-generation tele-dermatology applications, enhancing remote consultation capabilities and access to care, especially in underserved areas.

- **Summary**: The 3D Gaussian splatting method has drawn a lot of attention, thanks to its high performance in training and high quality of the rendered image. However, it uses anisotropic Gaussian kernels to represent the scene. Although such anisotropic kernels have advantages in representing the geometry, they lead to difficulties in terms of computation, such as splitting or merging two kernels. In this paper, we propose to use isotropic Gaussian kernels to avoid such difficulties in the computation, leading to a higher performance method. The experiments confirm that the proposed method is about {\bf 100X} faster without losing the geometry representation accuracy. The proposed method can be applied in a large range applications where the radiance field is needed, such as 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and dynamic object modeling.

- **Summary**: The widespread availability of publicly accessible medical images has significantly propelled advancements in various research and clinical fields. Nonetheless, concerns regarding unauthorized training of AI systems for commercial purposes and the duties of patient privacy protection have led numerous institutions to hesitate to share their images. This is particularly true for medical image segmentation (MIS) datasets, where the processes of collection and fine-grained annotation are time-intensive and laborious. Recently, Unlearnable Examples (UEs) methods have shown the potential to protect images by adding invisible shortcuts. These shortcuts can prevent unauthorized deep neural networks from generalizing. However, existing UEs are designed for natural image classification and fail to protect MIS datasets imperceptibly as their protective perturbations are less learnable than important prior knowledge in MIS, e.g., contour and texture features. To this end, we propose an Unlearnable Medical image generation method, termed UMed. UMed integrates the prior knowledge of MIS by injecting contour- and texture-aware perturbations to protect images. Given that our target is to only poison features critical to MIS, UMed requires only minimal perturbations within the ROI and its contour to achieve greater imperceptibility (average PSNR is 50.03) and protective performance (clean average DSC degrades from 82.18% to 6.80%).

- **Summary**: This paper proposes LayoutLLM, a more flexible document analysis method for understanding imaged documents. Visually Rich Document Understanding tasks, such as document image classification and information extraction, have gained significant attention due to their importance. Existing methods have been developed to enhance document comprehension by incorporating pre-training awareness of images, text, and layout structure. However, these methods require fine-tuning for each task and dataset, and the models are expensive to train and operate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new LayoutLLM that integrates these with large-scale language models (LLMs). By leveraging the strengths of existing research in document image understanding and LLMs' superior language understanding capabilities, the proposed model, fine-tuned with multimodal instruction datasets, performs an understanding of document images in a single model. Our experiments demonstrate improvement over the baseline model in various document analysis tasks.

- **Summary**: Supervised deep learning techniques show promise in medical image analysis. However, they require comprehensive annotated data sets, which poses challenges, particularly for rare diseases. Consequently, unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) emerges as a viable alternative for pathology segmentation, as only healthy data is required for training. However, recent UAD anomaly scoring functions often focus on intensity only and neglect structural differences, which impedes the segmentation performance. This work investigates the potential of Structural Similarity (SSIM) to bridge this gap. SSIM captures both intensity and structural disparities and can be advantageous over the classical $l1$ error. However, we show that there is more than one optimal kernel size for the SSIM calculation for different pathologies. Therefore, we investigate an adaptive ensembling strategy for various kernel sizes to offer a more pathology-agnostic scoring mechanism. We demonstrate that this ensembling strategy can enhance the performance of DMs and mitigate the sensitivity to different kernel sizes across varying pathologies, highlighting its promise for brain MRI anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Portrait stylization is a challenging task involving the transformation of an input portrait image into a specific style while preserving its inherent characteristics. The recent introduction of Stable Diffusion (SD) has significantly improved the quality of outcomes in this field. However, a practical stylization framework that can effectively filter harmful input content and preserve the distinct characteristics of an input, such as skin-tone, while maintaining the quality of stylization remains lacking. These challenges have hindered the wide deployment of such a framework. To address these issues, this study proposes a portrait stylization framework that incorporates a nudity content identification module (NCIM) and a skin-tone-aware portrait stylization module (STAPSM). In experiments, NCIM showed good performance in enhancing explicit content filtering, and STAPSM accurately represented a diverse range of skin tones. Our proposed framework has been successfully deployed in practice, and it has effectively satisfied critical requirements of real-world applications.

- **Summary**: Visual relationship detection aims to identify objects and their relationships in images. Prior methods approach this task by adding separate relationship modules or decoders to existing object detection architectures. This separation increases complexity and hinders end-to-end training, which limits performance. We propose a simple and highly efficient decoder-free architecture for open-vocabulary visual relationship detection. Our model consists of a Transformer-based image encoder that represents objects as tokens and models their relationships implicitly. To extract relationship information, we introduce an attention mechanism that selects object pairs likely to form a relationship. We provide a single-stage recipe to train this model on a mixture of object and relationship detection data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art relationship detection performance on Visual Genome and on the large-vocabulary GQA benchmark at real-time inference speeds. We provide analyses of zero-shot performance, ablations, and real-world qualitative examples.

- **Summary**: Estimating the pose of objects through vision is essential to make robotic platforms interact with the environment. Yet, it presents many challenges, often related to the lack of flexibility and generalizability of state-of-the-art solutions. Diffusion models are a cutting-edge neural architecture transforming 2D and 3D computer vision, outlining remarkable performances in zero-shot novel-view synthesis. Such a use case is particularly intriguing for reconstructing 3D objects. However, localizing objects in unstructured environments is rather unexplored. To this end, this work presents Zero123-6D to demonstrate the utility of Diffusion Model-based novel-view-synthesizers in enhancing RGB 6D pose estimation at category-level by integrating them with feature extraction techniques. The outlined method exploits such a novel view synthesizer to expand a sparse set of RGB-only reference views for the zero-shot 6D pose estimation task. Experiments are quantitatively analyzed on the CO3D dataset, showcasing increased performance over baselines, a substantial reduction in data requirements, and the removal of the necessity of depth information.

- **Summary**: Clustering speaker embeddings is crucial in speaker diarization but hasn't received as much focus as other components. Moreover, the robustness of speaker diarization across various datasets hasn't been explored when the development and evaluation data are from different domains. To bridge this gap, this study thoroughly examines spectral clustering for both same-domain and cross-domain speaker diarization. Our extensive experiments on two widely used corpora, AMI and DIHARD, reveal the performance trend of speaker diarization in the presence of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation originates due to the mismatch. This study opens several future directions for speaker diarization research.

- **Summary**: In analyzing vast amounts of digitally stored historical image data, existing content-based retrieval methods often overlook significant non-semantic information, limiting their effectiveness for flexible exploration across varied themes. To broaden the applicability of image retrieval methods for diverse purposes and uncover more general patterns, we innovatively introduce a crucial factor from computational aesthetics, namely image composition, into this topic. By explicitly integrating composition-related information extracted by CNN into the designed retrieval model, our method considers both the image's composition rules and semantic information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the image retrieval network guided by composition information outperforms those relying solely on content information, facilitating the identification of images in databases closer to the target image in human perception.

- **Summary**: The state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors leveraging deep neural networks exhibit impressive recognition performance. Nonetheless, this advantage is accompanied by a significant carbon footprint. This is mainly due to the use of high-performance computing with accelerators and high training time. Studies show that average deep NLP model produces around 626k lbs of CO\textsubscript{2} which is equivalent to five times of average US car emission at its lifetime. This is certainly a massive threat to the environment. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for audio deepfake detection that can be seamlessly trained using standard CPU resources. Our proposed framework utilizes off-the-shelve self-supervised learning (SSL) based models which are pre-trained and available in public repositories. In contrast to existing methods that fine-tune SSL models and employ additional deep neural networks for downstream tasks, we exploit classical machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and shallow neural networks using the SSL embeddings extracted using the pre-trained model. Our approach shows competitive results compared to the commonly used high-carbon footprint approaches. In experiments with the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset, we achieve a 0.90\% equal error rate (EER) with less than 1k trainable model parameters. To encourage further research in this direction and support reproducible results, the Python code will be made publicly accessible following acceptance.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models represent a new paradigm in text-to-image generation. Beyond generating high-quality images from text prompts, models such as Stable Diffusion have been successfully extended to the joint generation of semantic segmentation pseudo-masks. However, current extensions primarily rely on extracting attentions linked to prompt words used for image synthesis. This approach limits the generation of segmentation masks derived from word tokens not contained in the text prompt. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Attention Maps (OVAM)-a training-free method for text-to-image diffusion models that enables the generation of attention maps for any word. In addition, we propose a lightweight optimization process based on OVAM for finding tokens that generate accurate attention maps for an object class with a single annotation. We evaluate these tokens within existing state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion extensions. The best-performing model improves its mIoU from 52.1 to 86.6 for the synthetic images' pseudo-masks, demonstrating that our optimized tokens are an efficient way to improve the performance of existing methods without architectural changes or retraining.

- **Summary**: Inpainting, for filling missing image regions, is a crucial task in various applications, such as medical imaging and remote sensing. Trending data-driven approaches efficiency, for image inpainting, often requires extensive data preprocessing. In this sense, there is still a need for model-driven approaches in case of application constrained with data availability and quality, especially for those related for time series forecasting using image inpainting techniques. This paper proposes an improved modeldriven approach relying on patch-based techniques. Our approach deviates from the standard Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) similarity measure by introducing a Hybrid Similarity (HySim), which combines both strengths of Chebychev and Minkowski distances. This hybridization enhances patch selection, leading to high-quality inpainting results with reduced mismatch errors. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of our approach against other model-driven techniques, such as diffusion or patch-based approaches, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving visually pleasing restorations.

- **Summary**: Earth observation (EO) applications involving complex and heterogeneous data sources are commonly approached with machine learning models. However, there is a common assumption that data sources will be persistently available. Different situations could affect the availability of EO sources, like noise, clouds, or satellite mission failures. In this work, we assess the impact of missing temporal and static EO sources in trained models across four datasets with classification and regression tasks. We compare the predictive quality of different methods and find that some are naturally more robust to missing data. The Ensemble strategy, in particular, achieves a prediction robustness up to 100%. We evidence that missing scenarios are significantly more challenging in regression than classification tasks. Finally, we find that the optical view is the most critical view when it is missing individually.

- **Summary**: The remarkable success of Vision Transformers in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has led to a growing interest in incorporating the self-attention mechanism and transformer-based architecture into Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). While existing methods propose spiking self-attention mechanisms that are compatible with SNNs, they lack reasonable scaling methods, and the overall architectures proposed by these methods suffer from a bottleneck in effectively extracting local features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spiking self-attention mechanism named Dual Spike Self-Attention (DSSA) with a reasonable scaling method. Based on DSSA, we propose a novel spiking Vision Transformer architecture called SpikingResformer, which combines the ResNet-based multi-stage architecture with our proposed DSSA to improve both performance and energy efficiency while reducing parameters. Experimental results show that SpikingResformer achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption than other spiking Vision Transformer counterparts. Notably, our SpikingResformer-L achieves 79.40% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 4 time-steps, which is the state-of-the-art result in the SNN field.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variations have shown effectiveness in facial expression recognition (FER). However, they face challenges when dealing with high computational complexity and multi-view head poses in real-world scenarios. We introduce a lightweight attentional network incorporating multi-scale feature fusion (LANMSFF) to tackle these issues. For the first challenge, we have carefully designed a lightweight fully convolutional network (FCN). We address the second challenge by presenting two novel components, namely mass attention (MassAtt) and point wise feature selection (PWFS) blocks. The MassAtt block simultaneously generates channel and spatial attention maps to recalibrate feature maps by emphasizing important features while suppressing irrelevant ones. On the other hand, the PWFS block employs a feature selection mechanism that discards less meaningful features prior to the fusion process. This mechanism distinguishes it from previous methods that directly fuse multi-scale features. Our proposed approach achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of parameter counts and robustness to pose variation, with accuracy rates of 90.77% on KDEF, 70.44% on FER-2013, and 86.96% on FERPlus datasets. The code for LANMSFF is available at https://github.com/AE-1129/LANMSFF.

- **Summary**: Exoskeletons for daily use by those with mobility impairments are being developed. They will require accurate and robust scene understanding systems. Current research has used vision to identify immediate terrain and geometric obstacles, however these approaches are constrained to detections directly in front of the user and are limited to classifying a finite range of terrain types (e.g., stairs, ramps and level-ground). This paper presents Exosense, a vision-centric scene understanding system which is capable of generating rich, globally-consistent elevation maps, incorporating both semantic and terrain traversability information. It features an elastic Atlas mapping framework associated with a visual SLAM pose graph, embedded with open-vocabulary room labels from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). The device's design includes a wide field-of-view (FoV) fisheye multi-camera system to mitigate the challenges introduced by the exoskeleton walking pattern. We demonstrate the system's robustness to the challenges of typical periodic walking gaits, and its ability to construct accurate semantically-rich maps in indoor settings. Additionally, we showcase its potential for motion planning -- providing a step towards safe navigation for exoskeletons.

- **Summary**: The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has opened new horizons in bioimaging. A compelling trend in this field involves deliberately compromising certain measurement metrics to engineer better bioimaging tools in terms of cost, speed, and form-factor, followed by compensating for the resulting defects through the utilization of deep learning models trained on a large amount of ideal, superior or alternative data. This strategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to enhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations for employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or increased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological processes. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware requirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more accessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth review of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair in their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function, signal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately compromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through the application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other crucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and space-bandwidth product. Here, we discuss various biophotonic methods that have successfully employed this strategic approach. These techniques span broad applications and showcase the versatility and effectiveness of deep learning in the context of compromised biophotonic data. Finally, by offering our perspectives on the future possibilities of this rapidly evolving concept, we hope to motivate our readers to explore novel ways of balancing hardware compromises with compensation via AI.

- **Summary**: Domain generalization (DG) based Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) aims to improve the model's performance on unseen domains. Existing methods either rely on domain labels to align domain-invariant feature spaces, or disentangle generalizable features from the whole sample, which inevitably lead to the distortion of semantic feature structures and achieve limited generalization. In this work, we make use of large-scale VLMs like CLIP and leverage the textual feature to dynamically adjust the classifier's weights for exploring generalizable visual features. Specifically, we propose a novel Class Free Prompt Learning (CFPL) paradigm for DG FAS, which utilizes two lightweight transformers, namely Content Q-Former (CQF) and Style Q-Former (SQF), to learn the different semantic prompts conditioned on content and style features by using a set of learnable query vectors, respectively. Thus, the generalizable prompt can be learned by two improvements: (1) A Prompt-Text Matched (PTM) supervision is introduced to ensure CQF learns visual representation that is most informative of the content description. (2) A Diversified Style Prompt (DSP) technology is proposed to diversify the learning of style prompts by mixing feature statistics between instance-specific styles. Finally, the learned text features modulate visual features to generalization through the designed Prompt Modulation (PM). Extensive experiments show that the CFPL is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several cross-domain datasets.

- **Summary**: Improving model robustness in case of corrupted images is among the key challenges to enable robust vision systems on smart devices, such as robotic agents. Particularly, robust test-time performance is imperative for most of the applications. This paper presents a novel approach to improve robustness of any classification model, especially on severely corrupted images. Our method (FROST) employs high-frequency features to detect input image corruption type, and select layer-wise feature normalization statistics. FROST provides the state-of-the-art results for different models and datasets, outperforming competitors on ImageNet-C by up to 37.1% relative gain, improving baseline of 40.9% mCE on severe corruptions.

- **Summary**: Machine Unlearning, the process of selectively eliminating the influence of certain data examples used during a model's training, has gained significant attention as a means for practitioners to comply with recent data protection regulations. However, existing unlearning methods face critical drawbacks, including their prohibitively high cost, often associated with a large number of hyperparameters, and the limitation of forgetting only relatively small data portions. This often makes retraining the model from scratch a quicker and more effective solution. In this study, we introduce Gradient-based and Task-Agnostic machine Unlearning ($\nabla \tau$), an optimization framework designed to remove the influence of a subset of training data efficiently. It applies adaptive gradient ascent to the data to be forgotten while using standard gradient descent for the remaining data. $\nabla \tau$ offers multiple benefits over existing approaches. It enables the unlearning of large sections of the training dataset (up to 30%). It is versatile, supporting various unlearning tasks (such as subset forgetting or class removal) and applicable across different domains (images, text, etc.). Importantly, $\nabla \tau$ requires no hyperparameter adjustments, making it a more appealing option than retraining the model from scratch. We evaluate our framework's effectiveness using a set of well-established Membership Inference Attack metrics, demonstrating up to 10% enhancements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising the original model's accuracy.

- **Summary**: In the realm of digital pathology, multi-magnification Multiple Instance Learning (multi-mag MIL) has proven effective in leveraging the hierarchical structure of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to reduce information loss and redundant data. However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.

- **Summary**: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which break down the reasoning process into the input-to-concept mapping and the concept-to-label prediction, have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable interpretability achieved by the interpretable concept bottleneck. However, despite the transparency of the concept-to-label prediction, the mapping from the input to the intermediate concept remains a black box, giving rise to concerns about the trustworthiness of the learned concepts (i.e., these concepts may be predicted based on spurious cues). The issue of concept untrustworthiness greatly hampers the interpretability of CBMs, thereby hindering their further advancement. To conduct a comprehensive analysis on this issue, in this study we establish a benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of concepts in CBMs. A pioneering metric, referred to as concept trustworthiness score, is proposed to gauge whether the concepts are derived from relevant regions. Additionally, an enhanced CBM is introduced, enabling concept predictions to be made specifically from distinct parts of the feature map, thereby facilitating the exploration of their related regions. Besides, we introduce three modules, namely the cross-layer alignment (CLA) module, the cross-image alignment (CIA) module, and the prediction alignment (PA) module, to further enhance the concept trustworthiness within the elaborated CBM. The experiments on five datasets across ten architectures demonstrate that without using any concept localization annotations during training, our model improves the concept trustworthiness by a large margin, meanwhile achieving superior accuracy to the state-of-the-arts.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Deep learning-based techniques have proven effective in polyp segmentation tasks when provided with sufficient pixel-wise labeled data. However, the high cost of manual annotation has created a bottleneck for model generalization. To minimize annotation costs, we propose a deep active learning framework for annotation-efficient polyp segmentation. In practice, we measure the uncertainty of each sample by examining the similarity between features masked by the prediction map of the polyp and the background area. Since the segmentation model tends to perform weak in samples with indistinguishable features of foreground and background areas, uncertainty sampling facilitates the fitting of under-learning data. Furthermore, clustering image-level features weighted by uncertainty identify samples that are both uncertain and representative. To enhance the selectivity of the active selection strategy, we propose a novel unsupervised feature discrepancy learning mechanism. The selection strategy and feature optimization work in tandem to achieve optimal performance with a limited annotation budget. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to other competitors on both a public dataset and a large-scale in-house dataset.

- **Summary**: Despite recent advances in lane detection methods, scenarios with limited- or no-visual-clue of lanes due to factors such as lighting conditions and occlusion remain challenging and crucial for automated driving. Moreover, current lane representations require complex post-processing and struggle with specific instances. Inspired by the DETR architecture, we propose LDTR, a transformer-based model to address these issues. Lanes are modeled with a novel anchor-chain, regarding a lane as a whole from the beginning, which enables LDTR to handle special lanes inherently. To enhance lane instance perception, LDTR incorporates a novel multi-referenced deformable attention module to distribute attention around the object. Additionally, LDTR incorporates two line IoU algorithms to improve convergence efficiency and employs a Gaussian heatmap auxiliary branch to enhance model representation capability during training. To evaluate lane detection models, we rely on Frechet distance, parameterized F1-score, and additional synthetic metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that LDTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-known datasets.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral (HS) imagery in agriculture is becoming increasingly common. These images have the advantage of higher spectral resolution. Advanced spectral processing techniques are required to unlock the information potential in these HS images. The present paper introduces a method rooted in multivariate statistics designed to detect parasitic Varroa destructor mites on the body of western honey bee Apis mellifera, enabling easier and continuous monitoring of the bee hives. The methodology explores unsupervised (K-means++) and recently developed supervised (Kernel Flows - Partial Least-Squares, KF-PLS) methods for parasitic identification. Additionally, in light of the emergence of custom-band multispectral cameras, the present research outlines a strategy for identifying the specific wavelengths necessary for effective bee-mite separation, suitable for implementation in a custom-band camera. Illustrated with a real-case dataset, our findings demonstrate that as few as four spectral bands are sufficient for accurate parasite identification.



### Less but Better: Enabling Generalized Zero-shot Learning Towards Unseen Domains by Intrinsic Learning from Redundant LLM Semantics

- **Summary**: Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) focuses on recognizing seen and unseen classes against domain shift problem (DSP) where data of unseen classes may be misclassified as seen classes. However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we pioneer cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods which alleviate DSP by generating features of unseen classes with semantics, CDGZSL needs to construct a common feature space across domains and acquire the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class Similarity Alignment (ISA), which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and Unseen-class Meta Generation (UMG), which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on the Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as the benchmark.

- **Summary**: Vision-centric 3D environment understanding is both vital and challenging for autonomous driving systems. Recently, object-free methods have attracted considerable attention. Such methods perceive the world by predicting the semantics of discrete voxel grids but fail to construct continuous and accurate obstacle surfaces. To this end, in this paper, we propose SurroundSDF to implicitly predict the signed distance field (SDF) and semantic field for the continuous perception from surround images. Specifically, we introduce a query-based approach and utilize SDF constrained by the Eikonal formulation to accurately describe the surfaces of obstacles. Furthermore, considering the absence of precise SDF ground truth, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm for SDF, referred to as the Sandwich Eikonal formulation, which emphasizes applying correct and dense constraints on both sides of the surface, thereby enhancing the perceptual accuracy of the surface. Experiments suggest that our method achieves SOTA for both occupancy prediction and 3D scene reconstruction tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

- **Summary**: In this work we propose a novel method for unsupervised controllable video generation. Once trained on a dataset of unannotated videos, at inference our model is capable of both composing scenes of predefined object parts and animating them in a plausible and controlled way. This is achieved by conditioning video generation on a randomly selected subset of local pre-trained self-supervised features during training. We call our model CAGE for visual Composition and Animation for video GEneration. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate capabilities of CAGE in various settings.

- **Summary**: We introduce a general framework for generating diverse visual content, including ambiguous images, panorama images, mesh textures, and Gaussian splat textures, by synchronizing multiple diffusion processes. We present exhaustive investigation into all possible scenarios for synchronizing multiple diffusion processes through a canonical space and analyze their characteristics across applications. In doing so, we reveal a previously unexplored case: averaging the outputs of Tweedie's formula while conducting denoising in multiple instance spaces. This case also provides the best quality with the widest applicability to downstream tasks. We name this case SyncTweedies. In our experiments generating visual content aforementioned, we demonstrate the superior quality of generation by SyncTweedies compared to other synchronization methods, optimization-based and iterative-update-based methods.

- **Summary**: The conventional mesh-based Level of Detail (LoD) technique, exemplified by applications such as Google Earth and many game engines, exhibits the capability to holistically represent a large scene even the Earth, and achieves rendering with a space complexity of O(log n). This constrained data requirement not only enhances rendering efficiency but also facilitates dynamic data fetching, thereby enabling a seamless 3D navigation experience for users. In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our proposed method. Our contribution is not only in extending the capabilities of existing techniques but also in establishing a foundation for scalable and efficient large-scale scene representation using NeRF and octree structures.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent one of the most widely used neural network architectures, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks. Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, their size can be effectively reduced by "tensorization" while maintaining accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50 pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.

- **Summary**: We present a bag of tricks framework for few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL), which is a challenging form of continual learning that involves continuous adaptation to new tasks with limited samples. FSCIL requires both stability and adaptability, i.e., preserving proficiency in previously learned tasks while learning new ones. Our proposed bag of tricks brings together eight key and highly influential techniques that improve stability, adaptability, and overall performance under a unified framework for FSCIL. We organize these tricks into three categories: stability tricks, adaptability tricks, and training tricks. Stability tricks aim to mitigate the forgetting of previously learned classes by enhancing the separation between the embeddings of learned classes and minimizing interference when learning new ones. On the other hand, adaptability tricks focus on the effective learning of new classes. Finally, training tricks improve the overall performance without compromising stability or adaptability. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, CIFAR-100, CUB-200, and miniIMageNet, to evaluate the impact of our proposed framework. Our detailed analysis shows that our approach substantially improves both stability and adaptability, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior works in the area. We believe our method provides a go-to solution and establishes a robust baseline for future research in this area.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable success across various vision-language tasks. However, they suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses diverge from the provided image. Are MLLMs completely oblivious to accurate visual cues when they hallucinate? Our investigation reveals that the visual branch may simultaneously advocate both accurate and non-existent content. To address this issue, we propose Pensieve, a training-free method inspired by our observation that analogous visual hallucinations can arise among images sharing common semantic and appearance characteristics. During inference, Pensieve enables MLLMs to retrospect relevant images as references and compare them with the test image. This paradigm assists MLLMs in downgrading hallucinatory content mistakenly supported by the visual input. Experiments on Whoops, MME, POPE, and LLaVA Bench demonstrate the efficacy of Pensieve in mitigating visual hallucination, surpassing other advanced decoding strategies. Additionally, Pensieve aids MLLMs in identifying details in the image and enhancing the specificity of image descriptions.

  Models under Domain and Category Shift"
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: Deep neural networks often exhibit sub-optimal performance under covariate and category shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) presents a promising solution to this dilemma, yet most SFDA approaches are restricted to closed-set scenarios. In this paper, we explore Source-Free Universal Domain Adaptation (SF-UniDA) aiming to accurately classify "known" data belonging to common categories and segregate them from target-private "unknown" data. We propose a novel Global and Local Clustering (GLC) technique, which comprises an adaptive one-vs-all global clustering algorithm to discern between target classes, complemented by a local k-NN clustering strategy to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the effectiveness, the inherent closed-set source architecture leads to uniform treatment of "unknown" data, impeding the identification of distinct "unknown" categories. To address this, we evolve GLC to GLC++, integrating a contrastive affinity learning strategy. We examine the superiority of GLC and GLC++ across multiple benchmarks and category shift scenarios. Remarkably, in the most challenging open-partial-set scenarios, GLC and GLC++ surpass GATE by 16.7% and 18.6% in H-score on VisDA, respectively. GLC++ enhances the novel category clustering accuracy of GLC by 4.3% in open-set scenarios on Office-Home. Furthermore, the introduced contrastive learning strategy not only enhances GLC but also significantly facilitates existing methodologies.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results for novel view synthesis when a sufficiently large amount of views are available. When dealing with few-shot settings, i.e. with a small set of input views, the training could overfit those views, leading to artifacts and geometric and chromatic inconsistencies in the resulting rendering. Regularization is a valid solution that helps NeRF generalization. On the other hand, each of the most recent NeRF regularization techniques aim to mitigate a specific rendering problem. Starting from this observation, in this paper we propose CombiNeRF, a framework that synergically combines several regularization techniques, some of them novel, in order to unify the benefits of each. In particular, we regularize single and neighboring rays distributions and we add a smoothness term to regularize near geometries. After these geometric approaches, we propose to exploit Lipschitz regularization to both NeRF density and color networks and to use encoding masks for input features regularization. We show that CombiNeRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with few-shot settings in several publicly available datasets. We also present an ablation study on the LLFF and NeRF-Synthetic datasets that support the choices made. We release with this paper the open-source implementation of our framework.

- **Summary**: The booming of 3D recognition in the 2020s began with the introduction of point cloud transformers. They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became state-of-the-art models, especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However, sparse CNNs are still valuable networks, due to their efficiency treasure, and ease of application. In this work, we reexamine the design distinctions and test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically, we propose two key components, i.e., adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive relation, to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs), a family of networks that integrates a lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal computational cost. Without any self-attention modules, OA-CNNs favorably surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor scenes, with much less latency and memory cost. Notably, it achieves 76.1%, 78.9%, and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2, nuScenes, and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks respectively, while maintaining at most 5x better speed than transformer counterparts. This revelation highlights the potential of pure sparse CNNs to outperform transformer-related networks.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have been shown to suffer from sample-level memorization, possibly reproducing near-perfect replica of images that they are trained on, which may be undesirable. To remedy this issue, we develop the first differentially private (DP) retrieval-augmented generation algorithm that is capable of generating high-quality image samples while providing provable privacy guarantees. Specifically, we assume access to a text-to-image diffusion model trained on a small amount of public data, and design a DP retrieval mechanism to augment the text prompt with samples retrieved from a private retrieval dataset. Our \emph{differentially private retrieval-augmented diffusion model} (DP-RDM) requires no fine-tuning on the retrieval dataset to adapt to another domain, and can use state-of-the-art generative models to generate high-quality image samples while satisfying rigorous DP guarantees. For instance, when evaluated on MS-COCO, our DP-RDM can generate samples with a privacy budget of $\epsilon=10$, while providing a $3.5$ point improvement in FID compared to public-only retrieval for up to $10,000$ queries.

- **Summary**: Deep learning-based image generation has seen significant advancements with diffusion models, notably improving the quality of generated images. Despite these developments, generating images with unseen characteristics beneficial for downstream tasks has received limited attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Style-Extracting Diffusion Models, featuring two conditioning mechanisms. Specifically, we utilize 1) a style conditioning mechanism which allows to inject style information of previously unseen images during image generation and 2) a content conditioning which can be targeted to a downstream task, e.g., layout for segmentation. We introduce a trainable style encoder to extract style information from images, and an aggregation block that merges style information from multiple style inputs. This architecture enables the generation of images with unseen styles in a zero-shot manner, by leveraging styles from unseen images, resulting in more diverse generations. In this work, we use the image layout as target condition and first show the capability of our method on a natural image dataset as a proof-of-concept. We further demonstrate its versatility in histopathology, where we combine prior knowledge about tissue composition and unannotated data to create diverse synthetic images with known layouts. This allows us to generate additional synthetic data to train a segmentation network in a semi-supervised fashion. We verify the added value of the generated images by showing improved segmentation results and lower performance variability between patients when synthetic images are included during segmentation training. Our code will be made publicly available at [LINK].

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on open-ended video question answering, which aims to find the correct answers from a large answer set in response to a video-related question. This is essentially a multi-label classification task, since a question may have multiple answers. However, due to annotation costs, the labels in existing benchmarks are always extremely insufficient, typically one answer per question. As a result, existing works tend to directly treat all the unlabeled answers as negative labels, leading to limited ability for generalization. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective ranking distillation framework (RADI) to mitigate this problem without additional manual annotation. RADI employs a teacher model trained with incomplete labels to generate rankings for potential answers, which contain rich knowledge about label priority as well as label-associated visual cues, thereby enriching the insufficient labeling information. To avoid overconfidence in the imperfect teacher model, we further present two robust and parameter-free ranking distillation approaches: a pairwise approach which introduces adaptive soft margins to dynamically refine the optimization constraints on various pairwise rankings, and a listwise approach which adopts sampling-based partial listwise learning to resist the bias in teacher ranking. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks consistently show that both our pairwise and listwise RADIs outperform state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on the insufficient labeling problem.

- **Summary**: To visualize the regions of interest that classifiers base their decisions on, different Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have been developed. However, all of these techniques target categorical classifiers only, though most real-world tasks are binary classification. In this paper, we extend gradient-based CAM techniques to work with binary classifiers and visualize the active regions for binary facial attribute classifiers. When training an unbalanced binary classifier on an imbalanced dataset, it is well-known that the majority class, i.e. the class with many training samples, is mostly predicted much better than minority class with few training instances. In our experiments on the CelebA dataset, we verify these results, when training an unbalanced classifier to extract 40 facial attributes simultaneously. One would expect that the biased classifier has learned to extract features mainly for the majority classes and that the proportional energy of the activations mainly reside in certain specific regions of the image where the attribute is located. However, we find very little regular activation for samples of majority classes, while the active regions for minority classes seem mostly reasonable and overlap with our expectations. These results suggest that biased classifiers mainly rely on bias activation for majority classes. When training a balanced classifier on the imbalanced data by employing attribute-specific class weights, majority and minority classes are classified similarly well and show expected activations for almost all attributes

- **Summary**: Using RAW-images in computer vision problems is surprisingly underexplored considering that converting from RAW to RGB does not introduce any new capture information. In this paper, we show that a sufficiently advanced classifier can yield equivalent results on RAW input compared to RGB and present a new public dataset consisting of RAW images and the corresponding converted RGB images. Classifying images directly from RAW is attractive, as it allows for skipping the conversion to RGB, lowering computation time significantly. Two CNN classifiers are used to classify the images in both formats, confirming that classification performance can indeed be preserved. We furthermore show that the total computation time from RAW image data to classification results for RAW images can be up to 8.46 times faster than RGB. These results contribute to the evidence found in related works, that using RAW images as direct input to computer vision algorithms looks very promising.

- **Summary**: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models have become increasingly popular due to their ability to offer probabilistic modeling and generate diverse outputs. This versatility inspired their adaptation for image segmentation, where multiple predictions of the model can produce segmentation results that not only achieve high quality but also capture the uncertainty inherent in the model. Here, powerful architectures were proposed for improving diffusion segmentation performance. However, there is a notable lack of analysis and discussions on the differences between diffusion segmentation and image generation, and thorough evaluations are missing that distinguish the improvements these architectures provide for segmentation in general from their benefit for diffusion segmentation specifically. In this work, we critically analyse and discuss how diffusion segmentation for medical images differs from diffusion image generation, with a particular focus on the training behavior. Furthermore, we conduct an assessment how proposed diffusion segmentation architectures perform when trained directly for segmentation. Lastly, we explore how different medical segmentation tasks influence the diffusion segmentation behavior and the diffusion process could be adapted accordingly. With these analyses, we aim to provide in-depth insights into the behavior of diffusion segmentation that allow for a better design and evaluation of diffusion segmentation methods in the future.

- **Summary**: Before developing a Document Layout Analysis (DLA) model in real-world applications, conducting comprehensive robustness testing is essential. However, the robustness of DLA models remains underexplored in the literature. To address this, we are the first to introduce a robustness benchmark for DLA models, which includes 450K document images of three datasets. To cover realistic corruptions, we propose a perturbation taxonomy with 36 common document perturbations inspired by real-world document processing. Additionally, to better understand document perturbation impacts, we propose two metrics, Mean Perturbation Effect (mPE) for perturbation assessment and Mean Robustness Degradation (mRD) for robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a self-titled model, i.e., Robust Document Layout Analyzer (RoDLA), which improves attention mechanisms to boost extraction of robust features. Experiments on the proposed benchmarks (PubLayNet-P, DocLayNet-P, and M$^6$Doc-P) demonstrate that RoDLA obtains state-of-the-art mRD scores of 115.7, 135.4, and 150.4, respectively. Compared to previous methods, RoDLA achieves notable improvements in mAP of +3.8%, +7.1% and +12.1%, respectively.

- **Summary**: We introduce HARPER, a novel dataset for 3D body pose estimation and forecast in dyadic interactions between users and \spot, the quadruped robot manufactured by Boston Dynamics. The key-novelty is the focus on the robot's perspective, i.e., on the data captured by the robot's sensors. These make 3D body pose analysis challenging because being close to the ground captures humans only partially. The scenario underlying HARPER includes 15 actions, of which 10 involve physical contact between the robot and users. The Corpus contains not only the recordings of the built-in stereo cameras of Spot, but also those of a 6-camera OptiTrack system (all recordings are synchronized). This leads to ground-truth skeletal representations with a precision lower than a millimeter. In addition, the Corpus includes reproducible benchmarks on 3D Human Pose Estimation, Human Pose Forecasting, and Collision Prediction, all based on publicly available baseline approaches. This enables future HARPER users to rigorously compare their results with those we provide in this work.

- **Summary**: In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography remains the most robust imaging technique. However, it is at the expense of the patient and clinician's health due to prolonged radiation exposure. As an alternative, interventional ultrasound has notable benefits such as being radiation-free, fast to deploy, and having a small footprint in the operating room. Yet, ultrasound is hard to interpret, and highly prone to artifacts and noise. Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive training before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients effectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source datasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a self-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal ultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture builds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in Attention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and space. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on physics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a unique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation performance. We generated ground truth segmentation masks by computing the optical flow between adjacent frames using FlowNet2, and performed thresholding to obtain a binary map estimate. Finally, we validated our model on a test dataset, consisting of unseen synthetic data and images collected from silicon aorta phantoms, thus demonstrating its potential for applications to clinical data in the future.

- **Summary**: Video-to-video editing involves editing a source video along with additional control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g. InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks. Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse user demands.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments to compare knowledge editing approaches with previous baselines, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxify approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.

- **Summary**: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by varied social cognitive challenges and repetitive behavioral patterns. Identifying reliable brain imaging-based biomarkers for ASD has been a persistent challenge due to the spectrum's diverse symptomatology. Existing baselines in the field have made significant strides in this direction, yet there remains room for improvement in both performance and interpretability. We propose \emph{HyperGALE}, which builds upon the hypergraph by incorporating learned hyperedges and gated attention mechanisms. This approach has led to substantial improvements in the model's ability to interpret complex brain graph data, offering deeper insights into ASD biomarker characterization. Evaluated on the extensive ABIDE II dataset, \emph{HyperGALE} not only improves interpretability but also demonstrates statistically significant enhancements in key performance metrics compared to both previous baselines and the foundational hypergraph model. The advancement \emph{HyperGALE} brings to ASD research highlights the potential of sophisticated graph-based techniques in neurodevelopmental studies.

- **Summary**: Recently, how to achieve precise image editing has attracted increasing attention, especially given the remarkable success of text-to-image generation models. To unify various spatial-aware image editing abilities into one framework, we adopt the concept of layers from the design domain to manipulate objects flexibly with various operations. The key insight is to transform the spatial-aware image editing task into a combination of two sub-tasks: multi-layered latent decomposition and multi-layered latent fusion. First, we segment the latent representations of the source images into multiple layers, which include several object layers and one incomplete background layer that necessitates reliable inpainting. To avoid extra tuning, we further explore the inner inpainting ability within the self-attention mechanism. We introduce a key-masking self-attention scheme that can propagate the surrounding context information into the masked region while mitigating its impact on the regions outside the mask. Second, we propose an instruction-guided latent fusion that pastes the multi-layered latent representations onto a canvas latent. We also introduce an artifact suppression scheme in the latent space to enhance the inpainting quality. Due to the inherent modular advantages of such multi-layered representations, we can achieve accurate image editing, and we demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses the latest spatial editing methods, including Self-Guidance and DiffEditor. Last, we show that our approach is a unified framework that supports various accurate image editing tasks on more than six different editing tasks.

- **Summary**: Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks is crucial, especially in critical domains like healthcare where significant financial interests heighten the risk of such attacks. Whole slide images (WSIs) are high-resolution, digitized versions of tissue samples mounted on glass slides, scanned using sophisticated imaging equipment. The digital analysis of WSIs presents unique challenges due to their gigapixel size and multi-resolution storage format. In this work, we aim at improving the robustness of cancer Gleason grading classification systems against adversarial attacks, addressing challenges at both the image and graph levels. As regards the proposed algorithm, we develop a novel and innovative graph-based model which utilizes GNN to extract features from the graph representation of WSIs. A denoising module, along with a pooling layer is incorporated to manage the impact of adversarial attacks on the WSIs. The process concludes with a transformer module that classifies various grades of prostate cancer based on the processed data. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a comparative analysis using two scenarios. Initially, we trained and tested the model without the denoiser using WSIs that had not been exposed to any attack. We then introduced a range of attacks at either the image or graph level and processed them through the proposed network. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of accuracy and kappa scores. The results from this comparison showed a significant improvement in cancer diagnosis accuracy, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in handling adversarial challenges in the context of medical imaging.



### Learning to Project for Cross-Task Knowledge Distillation

- **Summary**: Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) relies on a proficient teacher trained on the target task, which is not always available. In this setting, cross-task distillation can be used, enabling the use of any teacher model trained on a different task. However, many KD methods prove ineffective when applied to this cross-task setting. To address this limitation, we propose a simple modification: the use of an inverted projection. We show that this drop-in replacement for a standard projector is effective by learning to disregard any task-specific features which might degrade the student's performance. We find that this simple modification is sufficient for extending many KD methods to the cross-task setting, where the teacher and student tasks can be very different. In doing so, we obtain up to a 1.9% improvement in the cross-task setting compared to the traditional projection, at no additional cost. Our method can obtain significant performance improvements (up to 7%) when using even a randomly-initialised teacher on various tasks such as depth estimation, image translation, and semantic segmentation, despite the lack of any learned knowledge to transfer. To provide conceptual and analytical insights into this result, we show that using an inverted projection allows the distillation loss to be decomposed into a knowledge transfer and a spectral regularisation component. Through this analysis we are additionally able to propose a novel regularisation loss that allows teacher-free distillation, enabling performance improvements of up to 8.57% on ImageNet with no additional training costs.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel approach to video anomaly detection: we treat feature vectors extracted from videos as realizations of a random variable with a fixed distribution and model this distribution with a neural network. This lets us estimate the likelihood of test videos and detect video anomalies by thresholding the likelihood estimates. We train our video anomaly detector using a modification of denoising score matching, a method that injects training data with noise to facilitate modeling its distribution. To eliminate hyperparameter selection, we model the distribution of noisy video features across a range of noise levels and introduce a regularizer that tends to align the models for different levels of noise. At test time, we combine anomaly indications at multiple noise scales with a Gaussian mixture model. Running our video anomaly detector induces minimal delays as inference requires merely extracting the features and forward-propagating them through a shallow neural network and a Gaussian mixture model. Our experiments on five popular video anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, both in the object-centric and in the frame-centric setup.

- **Summary**: Monitoring diseases that affect the brain's structural integrity requires automated analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images, e.g., for the evaluation of volumetric changes. However, many of the evaluation tools are optimized for analyzing healthy tissue. To enable the evaluation of scans containing pathological tissue, it is therefore required to restore healthy tissue in the pathological areas. In this work, we explore and extend denoising diffusion models for consistent inpainting of healthy 3D brain tissue. We modify state-of-the-art 2D, pseudo-3D, and 3D methods working in the image space, as well as 3D latent and 3D wavelet diffusion models, and train them to synthesize healthy brain tissue. Our evaluation shows that the pseudo-3D model performs best regarding the structural-similarity index, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and mean squared error. To emphasize the clinical relevance, we fine-tune this model on data containing synthetic MS lesions and evaluate it on a downstream brain tissue segmentation task, whereby it outperforms the established FMRIB Software Library (FSL) lesion-filling method.

- **Summary**: Existing person re-identification methods have achieved remarkable advances in appearance-based identity association across homogeneous cameras, such as ground-ground matching. However, as a more practical scenario, aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has received minimal attention. To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge in AGPReID, the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet effective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple view-related and view-unrelated features, namely hierarchical subtractive separation and orthogonal loss, where the former separates these two features inside the VDT, and the latter constrains these two to be independent. In addition, we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO, consisting of five/eight aerial/ground cameras, 5,000 identities, and 108,563 images. Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solution for AGPReID, surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% on CARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID, keeping the same magnitude of computational complexity.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the application of multimodal large language models (MLLM) in various fields has achieved remarkable success. However, as the foundation model for many downstream tasks, current MLLMs are composed of the well-known Transformer network, which has a less efficient quadratic computation complexity. To improve the efficiency of such basic models, we propose Cobra, a linear computational complexity MLLM. Specifically, Cobra integrates the efficient Mamba language model into the visual modality. Moreover, we explore and study various modal fusion schemes to create an effective multi-modal Mamba. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) Cobra achieves extremely competitive performance with current computationally efficient state-of-the-art methods, \textit{e.g.}, LLaVA-Phi, TinyLLaVA, and MobileVLM v2, and has faster speed due to Cobra's linear sequential modeling. (2) Interestingly, the results of closed-set challenging prediction benchmarks show that Cobra performs well in overcoming visual illusions and spatial relationship judgments. (3) Notably, Cobra even achieves comparable performance to LLaVA with about 43% of the number of parameters. We will make all codes of Cobra open-source and hope that the proposed method can facilitate future research on complexity problems in MLLM.

- **Summary**: In clinical applications that involve ultrasound-guided intervention, the visibility of the needle can be severely impeded due to steep insertion and strong distractors such as speckle noise and anatomical occlusion. To address this challenge, we propose VibNet, a learning-based framework tailored to enhance the robustness and accuracy of needle detection in ultrasound images, even when the target becomes invisible to the naked eye. Inspired by Eulerian Video Magnification techniques, we utilize an external step motor to induce low-amplitude periodic motion on the needle. These subtle vibrations offer the potential to generate robust frequency features for detecting the motion patterns around the needle. To robustly and precisely detect the needle leveraging these vibrations, VibNet integrates learning-based Short-Time-Fourier-Transform and Hough-Transform modules to achieve successive sub-goals, including motion feature extraction in the spatiotemporal space, frequency feature aggregation, and needle detection in the Hough space. Based on the results obtained on distinct ex vivo porcine and bovine tissue samples, the proposed algorithm exhibits superior detection performance with efficient computation and generalization capability.

- **Summary**: Precise manipulation that is generalizable across scenes and objects remains a persistent challenge in robotics. Current approaches for this task heavily depend on having a significant number of training instances to handle objects with pronounced visual and/or geometric part ambiguities. Our work explores the grounding of fine-grained part descriptors for precise manipulation in a zero-shot setting by utilizing web-trained text-to-image diffusion-based generative models. We tackle the problem by framing it as a dense semantic part correspondence task. Our model returns a gripper pose for manipulating a specific part, using as reference a user-defined click from a source image of a visually different instance of the same object. We require no manual grasping demonstrations as we leverage the intrinsic object geometry and features. Practical experiments in a real-world tabletop scenario validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating its potential for advancing semantic-aware robotics manipulation.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a remarkable size reduction of over $75\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\times$ size reduction over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

- **Summary**: Sign language recognition (SLR) has recently achieved a breakthrough in performance thanks to deep neural networks trained on large annotated sign datasets. Of the many different sign languages, these annotated datasets are only available for a select few. Since acquiring gloss-level labels on sign language videos is difficult, learning by transferring knowledge from existing annotated sources is useful for recognition in under-resourced sign languages. This study provides a publicly available cross-dataset transfer learning benchmark from two existing public Turkish SLR datasets. We use a temporal graph convolution-based sign language recognition approach to evaluate five supervised transfer learning approaches and experiment with closed-set and partial-set cross-dataset transfer learning. Experiments demonstrate that improvement over finetuning based transfer learning is possible with specialized supervised transfer learning methods.

Inspired by remarkable achievements via domain randomization, we propose ObjectDR which synthesizes such paired data via a random simulation of visual variations in object appearances and backgrounds. Our data synthesis framework exploits a conditional generative model (e.g., ControlNet) to generate images conforming to spatial conditions such as 2.5D sketches, which are obtainable through a rendering process of 3D shapes from object collections (e.g., Objaverse-XL). To simulate diverse variations while preserving object silhouettes embedded in spatial conditions, we also introduce a disentangled framework which leverages an initial object guidance. After synthesizing a wide range of data, we pre-train a model on them so that it learns to capture a domain-invariant geometry prior which is consistent across various domains. We validate its effectiveness by substantially improving 3D shape reconstruction models on a real-world benchmark. In a scale-up evaluation, our pre-training achieves 23.6% superior results compared with the pre-training on high-quality computer graphics renderings.

- **Summary**: The application of data augmentation for deep learning (DL) methods plays an important role in achieving state-of-the-art results in supervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised image classification. In particular, channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) are integrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their proper applications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the application of channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectral data (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose an approach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects the physical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimates a score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time series that can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such as acquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare the scores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate the physical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label image classification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score that exceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve the performance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.

- **Summary**: We present DINO-Tracker -- a new framework for long-term dense tracking in video. The pillar of our approach is combining test-time training on a single video, with the powerful localized semantic features learned by a pre-trained DINO-ViT model. Specifically, our framework simultaneously adopts DINO's features to fit to the motion observations of the test video, while training a tracker that directly leverages the refined features. The entire framework is trained end-to-end using a combination of self-supervised losses, and regularization that allows us to retain and benefit from DINO's semantic prior. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on known benchmarks. DINO-tracker significantly outperforms self-supervised methods and is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised trackers, while outperforming them in challenging cases of tracking under long-term occlusions.

- **Summary**: While Transformers have rapidly gained popularity in various computer vision applications, post-hoc explanations of their internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Vision Transformers extract visual information by representing image regions as transformed tokens and integrating them via attention weights. However, existing post-hoc explanation methods merely consider these attention weights, neglecting crucial information from the transformed tokens, which fails to accurately illustrate the rationales behind the models' predictions. To incorporate the influence of token transformation into interpretation, we propose TokenTM, a novel post-hoc explanation method that utilizes our introduced measurement of token transformation effects. Specifically, we quantify token transformation effects by measuring changes in token lengths and correlations in their directions pre- and post-transformation. Moreover, we develop initialization and aggregation rules to integrate both attention weights and token transformation effects across all layers, capturing holistic token contributions throughout the model. Experimental results on segmentation and perturbation tests demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TokenTM compared to state-of-the-art Vision Transformer explanation methods.

- **Summary**: We propose Gaussian Frosting, a novel mesh-based representation for high-quality rendering and editing of complex 3D effects in real-time. Our approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that it outperforms existing surface-based approaches. We will release our code and a web-based viewer as additional contributions. Our project page is the following: https://anttwo.github.io/frosting/

- **Summary**: Localizing predefined 3D keypoints in a 2D image is an effective way to establish 3D-2D correspondences for 6DoF object pose estimation. However, unreliable localization results of invisible keypoints degrade the quality of correspondences. In this paper, we address this issue by localizing the important keypoints in terms of visibility. Since keypoint visibility information is currently missing in dataset collection process, we propose an efficient way to generate binary visibility labels from available object-level annotations, for keypoints of both asymmetric objects and symmetric objects. We further derive real-valued visibility-aware importance from binary labels based on PageRank algorithm. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our visibility-aware importance, we construct VAPO (Visibility-Aware POse estimator) by integrating the visibility-aware importance with a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, along with additional positional encoding. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular pose estimation benchmarks including Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-V. The results show that, VAPO improves both the keypoint correspondences and final estimated poses, and clearly achieves state-of-the-art performances.

- **Summary**: Image stylization involves manipulating the visual appearance and texture (style) of an image while preserving its underlying objects, structures, and concepts (content). The separation of style and content is essential for manipulating the image's style independently from its content, ensuring a harmonious and visually pleasing result. Achieving this separation requires a deep understanding of both the visual and semantic characteristics of images, often necessitating the training of specialized models or employing heavy optimization. In this paper, we introduce B-LoRA, a method that leverages LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to implicitly separate the style and content components of a single image, facilitating various image stylization tasks. By analyzing the architecture of SDXL combined with LoRA, we find that jointly learning the LoRA weights of two specific blocks (referred to as B-LoRAs) achieves style-content separation that cannot be achieved by training each B-LoRA independently. Consolidating the training into only two blocks and separating style and content allows for significantly improving style manipulation and overcoming overfitting issues often associated with model fine-tuning. Once trained, the two B-LoRAs can be used as independent components to allow various image stylization tasks, including image style transfer, text-based image stylization, consistent style generation, and style-content mixing.

- **Summary**: Recent works on the global place recognition treat the task as a retrieval problem, where an off-the-shelf global descriptor is commonly designed in image-based and LiDAR-based modalities. However, it is non-trivial to perform accurate image-LiDAR global place recognition since extracting consistent and robust global descriptors from different domains (2D images and 3D point clouds) is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel Voxel-Cross-Pixel (VXP) approach, which establishes voxel and pixel correspondences in a self-supervised manner and brings them into a shared feature space. Specifically, VXP is trained in a two-stage manner that first explicitly exploits local feature correspondences and enforces similarity of global descriptors. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks (Oxford RobotCar, ViViD++ and KITTI) demonstrate our method surpasses the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval by a large margin.

- **Summary**: PSALM is a powerful extension of the Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) to address the segmentation task challenges. To overcome the limitation of the LMM being limited to textual output, PSALM incorporates a mask decoder and a well-designed input schema to handle a variety of segmentation tasks. This schema includes images, task instructions, conditional prompts, and mask tokens, which enable the model to generate and classify segmentation masks effectively. The flexible design of PSALM supports joint training across multiple datasets and tasks, leading to improved performance and task generalization. PSALM achieves superior results on several benchmarks, such as RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, COCO Panoptic Segmentation, and COCO-Interactive, and further exhibits zero-shot capabilities on unseen tasks, such as open-vocabulary segmentation, generalized referring expression segmentation and video object segmentation, making a significant step towards a GPT moment in computer vision. Through extensive experiments, PSALM demonstrates its potential to transform the domain of image segmentation, leveraging the robust visual understanding capabilities of LMMs as seen in natural language processing.

- **Summary**: Recent large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating textual descriptions for visual content. However, these models lack an understanding of user-specific concepts. In this work, we take a first step toward the personalization of VLMs, enabling them to learn and reason over user-provided concepts. For example, we explore whether these models can learn to recognize you in an image and communicate what you are doing, tailoring the model to reflect your personal experiences and relationships. To effectively recognize a variety of user-specific concepts, we augment the VLM with external concept heads that function as toggles for the model, enabling the VLM to identify the presence of specific target concepts in a given image. Having recognized the concept, we learn a new concept embedding in the intermediate feature space of the VLM. This embedding is tasked with guiding the language model to naturally integrate the target concept in its generated response. We apply our technique to BLIP-2 and LLaVA for personalized image captioning and further show its applicability for personalized visual question-answering. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to generalize to unseen images of learned concepts while preserving the model behavior on unrelated inputs.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have unlocked powerful image manipulation capabilities. However, applying these methods to real images necessitates the inversion of the images into the domain of the pretrained diffusion model. Achieving faithful inversion remains a challenge, particularly for more recent models trained to generate images with a small number of denoising steps. In this work, we introduce an inversion method with a high quality-to-operation ratio, enhancing reconstruction accuracy without increasing the number of operations. Building on reversing the diffusion sampling process, our method employs an iterative renoising mechanism at each inversion sampling step. This mechanism refines the approximation of a predicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, by iteratively applying the pretrained diffusion model, and averaging these predictions. We evaluate the performance of our ReNoise technique using various sampling algorithms and models, including recent accelerated diffusion models. Through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons, we show its effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we confirm that our method preserves editability by demonstrating text-driven image editing on real images.

- **Summary**: We present T-Rex2, a highly practical model for open-set object detection. Previous open-set object detection methods relying on text prompts effectively encapsulate the abstract concept of common objects, but struggle with rare or complex object representation due to data scarcity and descriptive limitations. Conversely, visual prompts excel in depicting novel objects through concrete visual examples, but fall short in conveying the abstract concept of objects as effectively as text prompts. Recognizing the complementary strengths and weaknesses of both text and visual prompts, we introduce T-Rex2 that synergizes both prompts within a single model through contrastive learning. T-Rex2 accepts inputs in diverse formats, including text prompts, visual prompts, and the combination of both, so that it can handle different scenarios by switching between the two prompt modalities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-Rex2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot object detection capabilities across a wide spectrum of scenarios. We show that text prompts and visual prompts can benefit from each other within the synergy, which is essential to cover massive and complicated real-world scenarios and pave the way towards generic object detection.

- **Summary**: We introduce bounded generation as a generalized task to control video generation to synthesize arbitrary camera and subject motion based only on a given start and end frame. Our objective is to fully leverage the inherent generalization capability of an image-to-video model without additional training or fine-tuning of the original model. This is achieved through the proposed new sampling strategy, which we call Time Reversal Fusion, that fuses the temporally forward and backward denoising paths conditioned on the start and end frame, respectively. The fused path results in a video that smoothly connects the two frames, generating inbetweening of faithful subject motion, novel views of static scenes, and seamless video looping when the two bounding frames are identical. We curate a diverse evaluation dataset of image pairs and compare against the closest existing methods. We find that Time Reversal Fusion outperforms related work on all subtasks, exhibiting the ability to generate complex motions and 3D-consistent views guided by bounded frames.

- **Summary**: 3D content creation from text prompts has shown remarkable success recently. However, current text-to-3D methods often generate 3D results that do not align well with human preferences. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-to-3D models from human preference feedback. To begin with, we collect 25k expert comparisons based on a systematic annotation pipeline including rating and ranking. Then, we build Reward3D -- the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference reward model to effectively encode human preferences. Building upon the 3D reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D Feedback Learning (DreamFL), a direct tuning algorithm to optimize the multi-view diffusion models with a redefined scorer. Grounded by theoretical proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our DreamReward successfully generates high-fidelity and 3D consistent results with significant boosts in prompt alignment with human intention. Our results demonstrate the great potential for learning from human feedback to improve text-to-3D models.

- **Summary**: In the image acquisition process, various forms of degradation, including noise, haze, and rain, are frequently introduced. These degradations typically arise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient conditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous specialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific type of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant attention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model without requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However, these methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the distinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network based on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different degradation types impact the image content on different frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each restoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency information from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra of the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a bidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency components. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input for a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves adaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands according to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different image restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised representation learning has been highly promising for histopathology image analysis with numerous approaches leveraging their patient-slide-patch hierarchy to learn better representations. In this paper, we explore how the combination of domain specific natural language information with such hierarchical visual representations can benefit rich representation learning for medical image tasks. Building on automated language description generation for features visible in histopathology images, we present a novel language-tied self-supervised learning framework, Hierarchical Language-tied Self-Supervision (HLSS) for histopathology images. We explore contrastive objectives and granular language description based text alignment at multiple hierarchies to inject language modality information into the visual representations. Our resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two medical imaging benchmarks, OpenSRH and TCGA datasets. Our framework also provides better interpretability with our language aligned representation space. Code is available at https://github.com/Hasindri/HLSS.

- **Summary**: We introduce Videoshop, a training-free video editing algorithm for localized semantic edits. Videoshop allows users to use any editing software, including Photoshop and generative inpainting, to modify the first frame; it automatically propagates those changes, with semantic, spatial, and temporally consistent motion, to the remaining frames. Unlike existing methods that enable edits only through imprecise textual instructions, Videoshop allows users to add or remove objects, semantically change objects, insert stock photos into videos, etc. with fine-grained control over locations and appearance. We achieve this through image-based video editing by inverting latents with noise extrapolation, from which we generate videos conditioned on the edited image. Videoshop produces higher quality edits against 6 baselines on 2 editing benchmarks using 10 evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: 3D decomposition/segmentation still remains a challenge as large-scale 3D annotated data is not readily available. Contemporary approaches typically leverage 2D machine-generated segments, integrating them for 3D consistency. While the majority of these methods are based on NeRFs, they face a potential weakness that the instance/semantic embedding features derive from independent MLPs, thus preventing the segmentation network from learning the geometric details of the objects directly through radiance and density. In this paper, we propose ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both segmentation and reconstruction in 3D via the neural implicit surface representation, specifically Signal Distance Function (SDF), where the segmentation rendering is directly integrated with the volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces. Although based on ObjectSDF++, ClusteringSDF no longer requires the ground-truth segments for supervision while maintaining the capability of reconstructing individual object surfaces, but purely with the noisy and inconsistent labels from pre-trained models.As the core of ClusteringSDF, we introduce a high-efficient clustering mechanism for lifting the 2D labels to 3D and the experimental results on the challenging scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets show that ClusteringSDF can achieve competitive performance compared against the state-of-the-art with significantly reduced training time.

- **Summary**: We introduce GRM, a large-scale reconstructor capable of recovering a 3D asset from sparse-view images in around 0.1s. GRM is a feed-forward transformer-based model that efficiently incorporates multi-view information to translate the input pixels into pixel-aligned Gaussians, which are unprojected to create a set of densely distributed 3D Gaussians representing a scene. Together, our transformer architecture and the use of 3D Gaussians unlock a scalable and efficient reconstruction framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternatives regarding both reconstruction quality and efficiency. We also showcase the potential of GRM in generative tasks, i.e., text-to-3D and image-to-3D, by integrating it with existing multi-view diffusion models.

- **Summary**: Language has become a prominent modality in computer vision with the rise of multi-modal LLMs. Despite supporting long context-lengths, their effectiveness in handling long-term information gradually declines with input length. This becomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form video understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) for LLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable (i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively based on multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focus on pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporal scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on zero-shot visual question-answering benchmarks including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA and NExT-GQA, showing state-of-the-art performance at its scale.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization technique that, despite theoretical approximations, practically improves the network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant improvements. We believe the contributions of this work pave the way for advanced generative modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/tzco/Simplified-Diffusion-Schrodinger-Bridge.

- **Summary**: The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has garnered unparalleled attention, due to their superior performance in visual contexts. However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning. In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project page: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io

- **Summary**: We present a simple self-supervised method to enhance the performance of ViT features for dense downstream tasks. Our Lightweight Feature Transform (LiFT) is a straightforward and compact postprocessing network that can be applied to enhance the features of any pre-trained ViT backbone. LiFT is fast and easy to train with a self-supervised objective, and it boosts the density of ViT features for minimal extra inference cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LiFT can be applied with approaches that use additional task-specific downstream modules, as we integrate LiFT with ViTDet for COCO detection and segmentation. Despite the simplicity of LiFT, we find that it is not simply learning a more complex version of bilinear interpolation. Instead, our LiFT training protocol leads to several desirable emergent properties that benefit ViT features in dense downstream tasks. This includes greater scale invariance for features, and better object boundary maps. By simply training LiFT for a few epochs, we show improved performance on keypoint correspondence, detection, segmentation, and object discovery tasks. Overall, LiFT provides an easy way to unlock the benefits of denser feature arrays for a fraction of the computational cost.

- **Summary**: Obstacle detection and tracking represent a critical component in robot autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose ODTFormer, a Transformer-based model to address both obstacle detection and tracking problems. For the detection task, our approach leverages deformable attention to construct a 3D cost volume, which is decoded progressively in the form of voxel occupancy grids. We further track the obstacles by matching the voxels between consecutive frames. The entire model can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. Through extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and KITTI benchmarks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the obstacle detection task. We also report comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art obstacle tracking models while requiring only a fraction of their computation cost, typically ten-fold to twenty-fold less. The code and model weights will be publicly released.

- **Summary**: We propose MVSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting model learned from sparse multi-view images. To accurately localize the Gaussian centers, we propose to build a cost volume representation via plane sweeping in the 3D space, where the cross-view feature similarities stored in the cost volume can provide valuable geometry cues to the estimation of depth. We learn the Gaussian primitives' opacities, covariances, and spherical harmonics coefficients jointly with the Gaussian centers while only relying on photometric supervision. We demonstrate the importance of the cost volume representation in learning feed-forward Gaussian Splatting models via extensive experimental evaluations. On the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID benchmarks, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest feed-forward inference speed (22 fps). Compared to the latest state-of-the-art method pixelSplat, our model uses $10\times $ fewer parameters and infers more than $2\times$ faster while providing higher appearance and geometry quality as well as better cross-dataset generalization.

- **Summary**: We present a 3D shape completion method that recovers the complete geometry of multiple objects in complex scenes from a single RGB-D image. Despite notable advancements in single object 3D shape completion, high-quality reconstructions in highly cluttered real-world multi-object scenes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose OctMAE, an architecture that leverages an Octree U-Net and a latent 3D MAE to achieve high-quality and near real-time multi-object shape completion through both local and global geometric reasoning. Because a na\"ive 3D MAE can be computationally intractable and memory intensive even in the latent space, we introduce a novel occlusion masking strategy and adopt 3D rotary embeddings, which significantly improves the runtime and shape completion quality. To generalize to a wide range of objects in diverse scenes, we create a large-scale photorealistic dataset, featuring a diverse set of 12K 3D object models from the Objaverse dataset which are rendered in multi-object scenes with physics-based positioning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrates a strong zero-shot capability.

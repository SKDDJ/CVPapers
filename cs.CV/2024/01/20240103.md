- **Summary**: Vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved promising results on a variety of Computer Vision tasks, however their quadratic complexity in the number of input tokens has limited their application specially in resource-constrained settings. Previous approaches that employ gradual token reduction to address this challenge assume that token redundancy in one layer implies redundancy in all the following layers. We empirically demonstrate that this assumption is often not correct, i.e., tokens that are redundant in one layer can be useful in later layers. We employ this key insight to propose a novel token propagation controller (TPC) that incorporates two different token-distributions, i.e., pause probability and restart probability to control the reduction and reuse of tokens respectively, which results in more efficient token utilization. To improve the estimates of token distributions, we propose a smoothing mechanism that acts as a regularizer and helps remove noisy outliers. Furthermore, to improve the training-stability of our proposed TPC, we introduce a model stabilizer that is able to implicitly encode local image structures and minimize accuracy fluctuations during model training. We present extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset using DeiT, LV-ViT and Swin models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, compared to baseline models, our proposed method improves the inference speed of the DeiT-S by 250% while increasing the classification accuracy by 1.0%.

- **Summary**: Existing object recognition models have been shown to lack robustness in diverse geographical scenarios due to significant domain shifts in design and context. Class representations need to be adapted to more accurately reflect an object concept under these shifts. In the absence of training data from target geographies, we hypothesize that geography-specific descriptive knowledge of object categories can be leveraged to enhance robustness. For this purpose, we explore the feasibility of probing a large-language model for geography-specific object knowledge, and we investigate integrating knowledge in zero-shot and learnable soft prompting with the CLIP vision-language model. In particular, we propose a geography knowledge regularization method to ensure that soft prompts trained on a source set of geographies generalize to an unseen target set of geographies. Our gains on DollarStreet when generalizing from a model trained only on data from Europe are as large as +2.8 on countries from Africa, and +4.6 on the hardest classes. We further show competitive performance vs. few-shot target training, and provide insights into how descriptive knowledge captures geographical differences.

- **Summary**: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid tumors is crucial for developing effective treatment plans in clinical practice. Pathologically, thyroid tumors pose diagnostic challenges due to improper specimen sampling. In this study, we have designed a three-stage model using representation learning to integrate pixel-level and slice-level annotations for distinguishing thyroid tumors. This structure includes a pathology structure recognition method to predict structures related to thyroid tumors, an encoder-decoder network to extract pixel-level annotation information by learning the feature representations of image blocks, and an attention-based learning mechanism for the final classification task. This mechanism learns the importance of different image blocks in a pathological region, globally considering the information from each block. In the third stage, all information from the image blocks in a region is aggregated using attention mechanisms, followed by classification to determine the category of the region. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can predict microscopic structures more accurately. After color-coding, the method achieves results on unstained pathology slides that approximate the quality of Hematoxylin and eosin staining, reducing the need for stained pathology slides. Furthermore, by leveraging the concept of indirect measurement and extracting polarized features from structures correlated with lesions, the proposed method can also classify samples where membrane structures cannot be obtained through sampling, providing a potential objective and highly accurate indirect diagnostic technique for thyroid tumors.

- **Summary**: Reasoning over sports videos for question answering is an important task with numerous applications, such as player training and information retrieval. However, this task has not been explored due to the lack of relevant datasets and the challenging nature it presents. Most datasets for video question answering (VideoQA) focus mainly on general and coarse-grained understanding of daily-life videos, which is not applicable to sports scenarios requiring professional action understanding and fine-grained motion analysis. In this paper, we introduce the first dataset, named Sports-QA, specifically designed for the sports VideoQA task. The Sports-QA dataset includes various types of questions, such as descriptions, chronologies, causalities, and counterfactual conditions, covering multiple sports. Furthermore, to address the characteristics of the sports VideoQA task, we propose a new Auto-Focus Transformer (AFT) capable of automatically focusing on particular scales of temporal information for question answering. We conduct extensive experiments on Sports-QA, including baseline studies and the evaluation of different methods. The results demonstrate that our AFT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: While significant advancements have been made in video question answering (VideoQA), the potential benefits of enhancing model generalization through tailored difficulty scheduling have been largely overlooked in existing research. This paper seeks to bridge that gap by incorporating VideoQA into a curriculum learning (CL) framework that progressively trains models from simpler to more complex data. Recognizing that conventional self-paced CL methods rely on training loss for difficulty measurement, which might not accurately reflect the intricacies of video-question pairs, we introduce the concept of uncertainty-aware CL. Here, uncertainty serves as the guiding principle for dynamically adjusting the difficulty. Furthermore, we address the challenge posed by uncertainty by presenting a probabilistic modeling approach for VideoQA. Specifically, we conceptualize VideoQA as a stochastic computation graph, where the hidden representations are treated as stochastic variables. This yields two distinct types of uncertainty: one related to the inherent uncertainty in the data and another pertaining to the model's confidence. In practice, we seamlessly integrate the VideoQA model into our framework and conduct comprehensive experiments. The findings affirm that our approach not only achieves enhanced performance but also effectively quantifies uncertainty in the context of VideoQA.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools, rivaling GANs in sample quality and mirroring the likelihood scores of autoregressive models. A subset of these models, exemplified by DDIMs, exhibit an inherent asymmetry: they are trained over $T$ steps but only sample from a subset of $T$ during generation. This selective sampling approach, though optimized for speed, inadvertently misses out on vital information from the unsampled steps, leading to potential compromises in sample quality. To address this issue, we present the S$^{2}$-DMs, which is a new training method by using an innovative $L_{skip}$, meticulously designed to reintegrate the information omitted during the selective sampling phase. The benefits of this approach are manifold: it notably enhances sample quality, is exceptionally simple to implement, requires minimal code modifications, and is flexible enough to be compatible with various sampling algorithms. On the CIFAR10 dataset, models trained using our algorithm showed an improvement of 3.27% to 14.06% over models trained with traditional methods across various sampling algorithms (DDIMs, PNDMs, DEIS) and different numbers of sampling steps (10, 20, ..., 1000). On the CELEBA dataset, the improvement ranged from 8.97% to 27.08%. Access to the code and additional resources is provided in the github.

- **Summary**: Table structure recognition (TSR) aims at extracting tables in images into machine-understandable formats. Recent methods solve this problem by predicting the adjacency relations of detected cell boxes or learning to directly generate the corresponding markup sequences from the table images. However, existing approaches either count on additional heuristic rules to recover the table structures, or face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies within tables, resulting in increased complexity. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm. We model TSR as a logical location regression problem and propose a new TSR framework called LORE, standing for LOgical location REgression network, which for the first time regresses logical location as well as spatial location of table cells in a unified network. Our proposed LORE is conceptually simpler, easier to train, and more accurate than other paradigms of TSR. Moreover, inspired by the persuasive success of pre-trained models on a number of computer vision and natural language processing tasks, we propose two pre-training tasks to enrich the spatial and logical representations at the feature level of LORE, resulting in an upgraded version called LORE++. The incorporation of pre-training in LORE++ has proven to enjoy significant advantages, leading to a substantial enhancement in terms of accuracy, generalization, and few-shot capability compared to its predecessor. Experiments on standard benchmarks against methods of previous paradigms demonstrate the superiority of LORE++, which highlights the potential and promising prospect of the logical location regression paradigm for TSR.

- **Summary**: Multimodal deep learning utilizing imaging and diagnostic reports has made impressive progress in the field of medical imaging diagnostics, demonstrating a particularly strong capability for auxiliary diagnosis in cases where sufficient annotation information is lacking. Nonetheless, localizing diseases accurately without detailed positional annotations remains a challenge. Although existing methods have attempted to utilize local information to achieve fine-grained semantic alignment, their capability in extracting the fine-grained semantics of the comprehensive contextual within reports is limited. To solve this problem, we introduce a new method that takes full sentences from textual reports as the basic units for local semantic alignment. Our approach combines chest X-ray images with their corresponding textual reports, performing contrastive learning at both global and local levels. The leading results obtained by our method on multiple datasets confirm its efficacy in the task of lesion localization.

- **Summary**: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has emerged as a vital tool to evaluate agents' ability to understand human daily behaviors. Despite the recent success of large vision language models in many multi-modal tasks, complex situation reasoning over videos involving multiple human-object interaction events still remains challenging. In contrast, humans can easily tackle it by using a series of episode memories as anchors to quickly locate question-related key moments for reasoning. To mimic this effective reasoning strategy, we propose the Glance-Focus model. One simple way is to apply an action detection model to predict a set of actions as key memories. However, these actions within a closed set vocabulary are hard to generalize to various video domains. Instead of that, we train an Encoder-Decoder to generate a set of dynamic event memories at the glancing stage. Apart from using supervised bipartite matching to obtain the event memories, we further design an unsupervised memory generation method to get rid of dependence on event annotations. Next, at the focusing stage, these event memories act as a bridge to establish the correlation between the questions with high-level event concepts and low-level lengthy video content. Given the question, the model first focuses on the generated key event memory, then focuses on the most relevant moment for reasoning through our designed multi-level cross-attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on four Multi-Event VideoQA benchmarks including STAR, EgoTaskQA, AGQA, and NExT-QA. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing current large models in various challenging reasoning tasks.

- **Summary**: Access to high-quality datasets in the medical industry limits machine learning model performance. To address this issue, we propose a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) combined with a UNet architecture for X-ray image synthesis. Focused on pneumonia medical condition, our methodology employs over 3000 pneumonia X-ray images obtained from Kaggle for training. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as the model successfully generated realistic images with low Mean Squared Error (MSE). The synthesized images showed distinct differences from non-pneumonia images, highlighting the model's ability to capture key features of positive cases. Beyond pneumonia, the applications of this synthesizer extend to various medical conditions, provided an ample dataset is available. The capability to produce high-quality images can potentially enhance machine learning models' performance, aiding in more accurate and efficient medical diagnoses. This innovative DDPM-based X-ray photo synthesizer presents a promising avenue for addressing the scarcity of positive medical image datasets, paving the way for improved medical image analysis and diagnosis in the healthcare industry.



### Retraining-free Model Quantization via One-Shot Weight-Coupling Learning

- **Summary**: Quantization is of significance for compressing the over-parameterized deep neural models and deploying them on resource-limited devices. Fixed-precision quantization suffers from performance drop due to the limited numerical representation ability. Conversely, mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is advocated to compress the model effectively by allocating heterogeneous bit-width for layers. MPQ is typically organized into a searching-retraining two-stage process. Previous works only focus on determining the optimal bit-width configuration in the first stage efficiently, while ignoring the considerable time costs in the second stage. However, retraining always consumes hundreds of GPU-hours on the cutting-edge GPUs, thus hindering deployment efficiency significantly. In this paper, we devise a one-shot training-searching paradigm for mixed-precision model compression. Specifically, in the first stage, all potential bit-width configurations are coupled and thus optimized simultaneously within a set of shared weights. However, our observations reveal a previously unseen and severe bit-width interference phenomenon among highly coupled weights during optimization, leading to considerable performance degradation under a high compression ratio. To tackle this problem, we first design a bit-width scheduler to dynamically freeze the most turbulent bit-width of layers during training, to ensure the rest bit-widths converged properly. Then, taking inspiration from information theory, we present an information distortion mitigation technique to align the behaviour of the bad-performing bit-widths to the well-performing ones.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention from both academia and industries, which is expected to offer a safer and more efficient driving system. However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

- **Summary**: We propose DDN-SLAM, a real-time dense neural implicit semantic SLAM system designed for dynamic scenes. While existing neural implicit SLAM systems perform well in static scenes, they often encounter challenges in real-world environments with dynamic interferences, leading to ineffective tracking and mapping. DDN-SLAM utilizes the priors provided by the deep semantic system, combined with conditional probability fields, for segmentation.By constructing depth-guided static masks and employing joint multi-resolution hashing encoding, we ensure fast hole filling and high-quality mapping while mitigating the effects of dynamic information interference. To enhance tracking robustness, we utilize sparse feature points validated with optical flow and keyframes, enabling loop closure detection and global bundle optimization. Furthermore, DDN-SLAM supports monocular, stereo, and RGB-D inputs, operating robustly at a frequency of 20-30Hz. Extensive experiments on 6 virtual/real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both dynamic and static scenes.

- **Summary**: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as an effective method for unsupervised image denoising. However, INR models are typically overparameterized; consequently, these models are prone to overfitting during learning, resulting in suboptimal results, even noisy ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a general recipe for regularizing INR models in image denoising. In detail, we propose to iteratively substitute the supervision signal with the mean value derived from both the prediction and supervision signal during the learning process. We theoretically prove that such a simple iterative substitute can gradually enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the supervision signal, thereby benefiting INR models during the learning process. Our experimental results demonstrate that INR models can be effectively regularized by the proposed approach, relieving overfitting and boosting image denoising performance.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion is an indispensable task for recovering complete point clouds due to incompleteness caused by occlusion, limited sensor resolution, etc. The family of coarse-to-fine generation architectures has recently exhibited great success in point cloud completion and gradually became mainstream. In this work, we unveil one of the key ingredients behind these methods: meticulously devised feature extraction operations with explicit cross-resolution aggregation. We present Cross-Resolution Transformer that efficiently performs cross-resolution aggregation with local attention mechanisms. With the help of our recursive designs, the proposed operation can capture more scales of features than common aggregation operations, which is beneficial for capturing fine geometric characteristics. While prior methodologies have ventured into various manifestations of inter-level cross-resolution aggregation, the effectiveness of intra-level one and their combination has not been analyzed. With unified designs, Cross-Resolution Transformer can perform intra- or inter-level cross-resolution aggregation by switching inputs. We integrate two forms of Cross-Resolution Transformers into one up-sampling block for point generation, and following the coarse-to-fine manner, we construct CRA-PCN to incrementally predict complete shapes with stacked up-sampling blocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on several widely used benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal Learning has attracted widespread attention in medical image analysis. Using multi-modal data, whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information, can improve the performance of deep learning models in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis. However, clinical information is not easy to collect in clinical practice due to privacy concerns, limited resources, lack of interoperability, etc. Although patient selection can ensure the training set to have multi-modal data for model development, missing modality of clinical information can appear during test. This normally leads to performance degradation, which limits the use of multi-modal models in the clinic. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional distillation framework consisting of a multi-modal branch and a single-modal branch. The single-modal branch acquires the complete multi-modal knowledge from the multi-modal branch, while the multi-modal learns the robust features of WSI from the single-modal. We conduct experiments on a public dataset of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer to validate the method. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of 0.861 on the test set without missing data, but also yields an AUC of 0.842 when the rate of missing modality is 80\%. This shows the effectiveness of the approach in dealing with multi-modal data and missing modality. Such a model has the potential to improve treatment decision-making for early breast cancer patients who have axillary lymph node metastatic status.

- **Summary**: Late fusion multi-view clustering (LFMVC) has become a rapidly growing class of methods in the multi-view clustering (MVC) field, owing to its excellent computational speed and clustering performance. One bottleneck faced by existing late fusion methods is that they are usually aligned to the average kernel function, which makes the clustering performance highly dependent on the quality of datasets. Another problem is that they require subsequent k-means clustering after obtaining the consensus partition matrix to get the final discrete labels, and the resulting separation of the label learning and cluster structure optimization processes limits the integrity of these models. To address the above issues, we propose an integrated framework named One-Step Late Fusion Multi-view Clustering with Compressed Subspace (OS-LFMVC-CS). Specifically, we use the consensus subspace to align the partition matrix while optimizing the partition fusion, and utilize the fused partition matrix to guide the learning of discrete labels. A six-step iterative optimization approach with verified convergence is proposed. Sufficient experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

Nonetheless, a prevailing trend among existing methods has been the employment of linear combinations of basic LUTs to formulate image-adaptive LUTs, which limits the generalization ability of these methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework named AttentionLut for real-time image enhancement, which utilizes the attention mechanism to generate image-adaptive LUTs. Our proposed framework consists of three lightweight modules. We begin by employing the global image context feature module to extract image-adaptive features. Subsequently, the attention fusion module integrates the image feature with the priori attention feature obtained during training to generate image-adaptive canonical polyadic tensors. Finally, the canonical polyadic reconstruction module is deployed to reconstruct image-adaptive residual 3DLUT, which is subsequently utilized for enhancing input images. Experiments on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better enhancement performance quantitatively and qualitatively than the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) visual geo-localization aims to match images of the same geographic target captured from different views, i.e., the UAV view and the satellite view. It is very challenging due to the large appearance differences in UAV-satellite image pairs. Previous works map images captured by UAVs and satellites to a shared feature space and employ a classification framework to learn location-dependent features while neglecting the overall distribution shift between the UAV view and the satellite view. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing distribution alignment of the two views to shorten their distance in a common space. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end network, called PVDA (Progressive View Distribution Alignment). During training, feature encoder, location classifier, and view discriminator are jointly optimized by a novel progressive adversarial learning strategy. Competition between feature encoder and view discriminator prompts both of them to be stronger. It turns out that the adversarial learning is progressively emphasized until UAV-view images are indistinguishable from satellite-view images. As a result, the proposed PVDA becomes powerful in learning location-dependent yet view-invariant features with good scalability towards unseen images of new locations. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed PVDA requires less inference time but has achieved superior performance on the University-1652 dataset.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) visual geo-localization, which aims to match images of the same geographic target taken by different platforms, i.e., UAVs and satellites. In general, the key to achieving accurate UAV-satellite image matching lies in extracting visual features that are robust against viewpoint changes, scale variations, and rotations. Current works have shown that part matching is crucial for UAV visual geo-localization since part-level representations can capture image details and help to understand the semantic information of scenes. However, the importance of preserving semantic characteristics in part-level representations is not well discussed. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based adaptive semantic aggregation method that regards parts as the most representative semantics in an image. Correlations of image patches to different parts are learned in terms of the transformer's feature map. Then our method decomposes part-level features into an adaptive sum of all patch features. By doing this, the learned parts are encouraged to focus on patches with typical semantics. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 dataset have shown the superiority of our method over the current works.

- **Summary**: The blooming of social media and face recognition (FR) systems has increased people's concern about privacy and security. A new type of adversarial privacy cloak (class-universal) can be applied to all the images of regular users, to prevent malicious FR systems from acquiring their identity information. In this work, we discover the optimization dilemma in the existing methods -- the local optima problem in large-batch optimization and the gradient information elimination problem in small-batch optimization. To solve these problems, we propose Gradient Accumulation (GA) to aggregate multiple small-batch gradients into a one-step iterative gradient to enhance the gradient stability and reduce the usage of quantization operations. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves high performance on the Privacy-Commons dataset against black-box face recognition models.

- **Summary**: Despite the recent remarkable achievement in gaze estimation, efficient and accurate personalization of gaze estimation without labels is a practical problem but rarely touched on in the literature. To achieve efficient personalization, we take inspiration from the recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by updating a negligible number of parameters, "prompts", at the test time. Specifically, the prompt is additionally attached without perturbing original network and can contain less than 1% of a ResNet-18's parameters. Our experiments show high efficiency of the prompt tuning approach. The proposed one can be 10 times faster in terms of adaptation speed than the methods compared. However, it is non-trivial to update the prompt for personalized gaze estimation without labels. At the test time, it is essential to ensure that the minimizing of particular unsupervised loss leads to the goals of minimizing gaze estimation error. To address this difficulty, we propose to meta-learn the prompt to ensure that its updates align with the goal. Our experiments show that the meta-learned prompt can be effectively adapted even with a simple symmetry loss. In addition, we experiment on four cross-dataset validations to show the remarkable advantages of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Spatio-temporal video grounding (or STVG) task aims at locating a spatio-temporal tube for a specific instance given a text query. Despite advancements, current methods easily suffer the distractors or heavy object appearance variations in videos due to insufficient object information from the text, leading to degradation. Addressing this, we propose a novel framework, context-guided STVG (CG-STVG), which mines discriminative instance context for object in videos and applies it as a supplementary guidance for target localization. The key of CG-STVG lies in two specially designed modules, including instance context generation (ICG), which focuses on discovering visual context information (in both appearance and motion) of the instance, and instance context refinement (ICR), which aims to improve the instance context from ICG by eliminating irrelevant or even harmful information from the context. During grounding, ICG, together with ICR, are deployed at each decoding stage of a Transformer architecture for instance context learning. Particularly, instance context learned from one decoding stage is fed to the next stage, and leveraged as a guidance containing rich and discriminative object feature to enhance the target-awareness in decoding feature, which conversely benefits generating better new instance context for improving localization finally. Compared to existing methods, CG-STVG enjoys object information in text query and guidance from mined instance visual context for more accurate target localization. In our experiments on three benchmarks, including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, CG-STVG sets new state-of-the-arts in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on all of them, showing its efficacy. The code will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/CGSTVG.

- **Summary**: The development of multi-modal medical foundation models has attracted significant attention in the field of medicine and healthcare due to their promising prospects in various clinical applications. One area of focus in this research direction is the extractions of features at different scales. While previous studies have explored feature learning at individual scales, investigation on integrating the diverse scales and modalities of information is lacking, which may hinder the potential for mutual reinforcement among these features. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a method that effectively exploits multi-scale and cross-modality information to enhance the performance of medical foundation models. The proposed method simultaneously exploit features at the local, instance, modality and global aspects, facilitating comprehensive representation learning within the models. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on six open-source datasets across different clinical tasks, demonstrating its ability to enhance the performance of medical foundation models.

- **Summary**: The elderly population is increasing rapidly around the world. There are no enough caretakers for them. Use of AI-based in-home medical care systems is gaining momentum due to this. Human fall detection is one of the most important tasks of medical care system for the aged people. Human fall is a common problem among elderly people. Detection of a fall and providing medical help as early as possible is very important to reduce any further complexity. The chances of death and other medical complications can be reduced by detecting and providing medical help as early as possible after the fall. There are many state-of-the-art fall detection techniques available these days, but the majority of them need very high computing power. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight and fast human fall detection system using pose estimation. We used `Movenet' for human joins key-points extraction. Our proposed method can work in real-time on any low-computing device with any basic camera. All computation can be processed locally, so there is no problem of privacy of the subject. We used two datasets `GMDCSA' and `URFD' for the experiment. We got the sensitivity value of 0.9375 and 0.9167 for the dataset `GMDCSA' and `URFD' respectively. The source code and the dataset GMDCSA of our work are available online to access.

- **Summary**: Existing contrastive language-image pre-training aims to learn a joint representation by matching abundant image-text pairs. However, the number of image-text pairs in medical datasets is usually orders of magnitude smaller than that in natural datasets. Besides, medical image-text pairs often involve numerous complex fine-grained correspondences. This paper aims to enhance the data efficiency by introducing multiple-to-multiple local relationship modeling to capture denser supervisions. More specifically, we propose a Medical Language-Image Pre-training (MLIP) framework, which exploits the limited image-text medical data more efficiently through patch-sentence matching. Furthermore, we introduce a masked contrastive learning strategy with semantic integrity estimation to reduce redundancy in images while preserving the underlying semantics. Our evaluation results show that MLIP outperforms previous work in zero/few-shot classification and few-shot segmentation tasks by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously learn new classes based on very limited training data without forgetting the old ones encountered. Existing studies solely relied on pure visual networks, while in this paper we solved FSCIL by leveraging the Vision-Language model (e.g., CLIP) and propose a simple yet effective framework, named Learning Prompt with Distribution-based Feature Replay (LP-DiF). We observe that simply using CLIP for zero-shot evaluation can substantially outperform the most influential methods. Then, prompt tuning technique is involved to further improve its adaptation ability, allowing the model to continually capture specific knowledge from each session. To prevent the learnable prompt from forgetting old knowledge in the new session, we propose a pseudo-feature replay approach. Specifically, we preserve the old knowledge of each class by maintaining a feature-level Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which is estimated by the image features of training images and synthesized features generated from a VAE. When progressing to a new session, pseudo-features are sampled from old-class distributions combined with training images of the current session to optimize the prompt, thus enabling the model to learn new knowledge while retaining old knowledge. Experiments on three prevalent benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, CUB-200, and two more challenging benchmarks, i.e., SUN-397 and CUB-200$^*$ proposed in this paper showcase the superiority of LP-DiF, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in FSCIL.

- **Summary**: Striking a balance between precision and efficiency presents a prominent challenge in the bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection. Although previous camera-based BEV methods achieved remarkable performance by incorporating long-term temporal information, most of them still face the problem of low efficiency. One potential solution is knowledge distillation. Existing distillation methods only focus on reconstructing spatial features, while overlooking temporal knowledge. To this end, we propose TempDistiller, a Temporal knowledge Distiller, to acquire long-term memory from a teacher detector when provided with a limited number of frames. Specifically, a reconstruction target is formulated by integrating long-term temporal knowledge through self-attention operation applied to feature teachers. Subsequently, novel features are generated for masked student features via a generator. Ultimately, we utilize this reconstruction target to reconstruct the student features. In addition, we also explore temporal relational knowledge when inputting full frames for the student model. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on the nuScenes benchmark. The experimental results show our method obtain an enhancement of +1.6 mAP and +1.1 NDS compared to the baseline, a speed improvement of approximately 6 FPS after compressing temporal knowledge, and the most accurate velocity estimation.

- **Summary**: The recent development on large multimodal models (LMMs), especially GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini, has been quickly expanding the capability boundaries of multimodal models beyond traditional tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents - it can successfully complete 50% of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML text and visuals. Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further improvement.

- **Summary**: RGB-T semantic segmentation is a key technique for autonomous driving scenes understanding. For the existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods, however, the effective exploration of the complementary relationship between different modalities is not implemented in the information interaction between multiple levels. To address such an issue, the Context-Aware Interaction Network (CAINet) is proposed for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which constructs interaction space to exploit auxiliary tasks and global context for explicitly guided learning. Specifically, we propose a Context-Aware Complementary Reasoning (CACR) module aimed at establishing the complementary relationship between multimodal features with the long-term context in both spatial and channel dimensions. Further, considering the importance of global contextual and detailed information, we propose the Global Context Modeling (GCM) module and Detail Aggregation (DA) module, and we introduce specific auxiliary supervision to explicitly guide the context interaction and refine the segmentation map. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets of MFNet and PST900 demonstrate that the proposed CAINet achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YingLv1106/CAINet.

- **Summary**: Perceiving the complete shape of occluded objects is essential for human and machine intelligence. While the amodal segmentation task is to predict the complete mask of partially occluded objects, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to annotate the pixel-level ground truth amodal masks. Box-level supervised amodal segmentation addresses this challenge by relying solely on ground truth bounding boxes and instance classes as supervision, thereby alleviating the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations. Nevertheless, current box-level methodologies encounter limitations in generating low-resolution masks and imprecise boundaries, failing to meet the demands of practical real-world applications. We present a novel solution to tackle this problem by introducing a directed expansion approach from visible masks to corresponding amodal masks. Our approach involves a hybrid end-to-end network based on the overlapping region - the area where different instances intersect. Diverse segmentation strategies are applied for overlapping regions and non-overlapping regions according to distinct characteristics. To guide the expansion of visible masks, we introduce an elaborately-designed connectivity loss for overlapping regions, which leverages correlations with visible masks and facilitates accurate amodal segmentation. Experiments are conducted on several challenging datasets and the results show that our proposed method can outperform existing state-of-the-art methods with large margins.

- **Summary**: Stereo matching and semantic segmentation are significant tasks in binocular satellite 3D reconstruction. However, previous studies primarily view these as independent parallel tasks, lacking an integrated multitask learning framework. This work introduces a solution, the Single-branch Semantic Stereo Network (S3Net), which innovatively combines semantic segmentation and stereo matching using Self-Fuse and Mutual-Fuse modules. Unlike preceding methods that utilize semantic or disparity information independently, our method dentifies and leverages the intrinsic link between these two tasks, leading to a more accurate understanding of semantic information and disparity estimation. Comparative testing on the US3D dataset proves the effectiveness of our S3Net. Our model improves the mIoU in semantic segmentation from 61.38 to 67.39, and reduces the D1-Error and average endpoint error (EPE) in disparity estimation from 10.051 to 9.579 and 1.439 to 1.403 respectively, surpassing existing competitive methods.

- **Summary**: Multimodal learning significantly benefits cancer survival prediction, especially the integration of pathological images and genomic data. Despite advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic data, leading to an ``intra-modal redundancy" issue. (2) Duplicated information among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an ``inter-modal redundancy" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework, Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal redundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed to model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk levels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within modality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct components: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance of the joint prototypical distribution. Extensive experiments on five cancer benchmark datasets demonstrated our superiority over other methods.

- **Summary**: Advances in image diffusion models have recently led to notable improvements in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However, most generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF, a novel approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency across the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the image diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh.

- **Summary**: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the source data is unavailable during adaptation. Existing approaches for SFDA focus on self-training usually including well-established entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling techniques. Recent work suggested a co-learning strategy to improve the quality of the generated target pseudo-labels using robust pretrained networks such as Swin-B. However, since the generated pseudo-labels depend on the source model, they may be noisy due to domain shift. In this paper, we view SFDA from the perspective of label noise learning and learn to de-confuse the pseudo-labels. More specifically, we learn a noise transition matrix of the pseudo-labels to capture the label corruption of each class and learn the underlying true label distribution. Estimating the noise transition matrix enables a better true class-posterior estimation results with better prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach applied with several SFDA methods: SHOT, SHOT++, and AaD. We obtain state-of-the-art results on three domain adaptation datasets: VisDA, DomainNet, and OfficeHome.

- **Summary**: The burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is witnessing rapid advancements, particularly in video generation. This paper introduces AIGCBench, a pioneering comprehensive and scalable benchmark designed to evaluate a variety of video generation tasks, with a primary focus on Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. AIGCBench tackles the limitations of existing benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including a varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different state-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text combiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate images via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation framework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics spanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video quality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed correlates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive experiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field. AIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks for the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework for future assessments of video generation tasks.

- **Summary**: Object detection models represented by YOLO series have been widely used and have achieved great results on the high quality datasets, but not all the working conditions are ideal. To settle down the problem of locating targets on low quality datasets, the existing methods either train a new object detection network, or need a large collection of low-quality datasets to train. However, we propose a framework in this paper and apply it on the YOLO models called DiffYOLO. Specifically, we extract feature maps from the denoising diffusion probabilistic models to enhance the well-trained models, which allows us fine-tune YOLO on high-quality datasets and test on low-quality datasets. The results proved this framework can not only prove the performance on noisy datasets, but also prove the detection results on high-quality test datasets. We will supplement more experiments later (with various datasets and network architectures).

- **Summary**: Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) plays a crucial role in the noninvasive investigation of tissue microstructural properties and structural connectivity in the \textit{in vivo} human brain. However, to effectively capture the intricate characteristics of water diffusion at various directions and scales, it is important to employ comprehensive q-space sampling. Unfortunately, this requirement leads to long scan times, limiting the clinical applicability of dMRI. To address this challenge, we propose SSOR, a Simultaneous q-Space sampling Optimization and Reconstruction framework. We jointly optimize a subset of q-space samples using a continuous representation of spherical harmonic functions and a reconstruction network. Additionally, we integrate the unique properties of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in both the q-space and image domains by applying $l1$-norm and total-variation regularization. The experiments conducted on HCP data demonstrate that SSOR has promising strengths both quantitatively and qualitatively and exhibits robustness to noise.

- **Summary**: Many RGBT tracking researches primarily focus on modal fusion design, while overlooking the effective handling of target appearance changes. While some approaches have introduced historical frames or fuse and replace initial templates to incorporate temporal information, they have the risk of disrupting the original target appearance and accumulating errors over time. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer RGBT tracking approach, which mixes spatio-temporal multimodal tokens from the static multimodal templates and multimodal search regions in Transformer to handle target appearance changes, for robust RGBT tracking. We introduce independent dynamic template tokens to interact with the search region, embedding temporal information to address appearance changes, while also retaining the involvement of the initial static template tokens in the joint feature extraction process to ensure the preservation of the original reliable target appearance information that prevent deviations from the target appearance caused by traditional temporal updates. We also use attention mechanisms to enhance the target features of multimodal template tokens by incorporating supplementary modal cues, and make the multimodal search region tokens interact with multimodal dynamic template tokens via attention mechanisms, which facilitates the conveyance of multimodal-enhanced target change information. Our module is inserted into the transformer backbone network and inherits joint feature extraction, search-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on three RGBT benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach maintains competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms while running at 39.1 FPS.

- **Summary**: The availability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data is increasing along with the availability of different GPS receivers and with the increasing use of various mobility services. GPS trajectory is an important data source which is used in traffic density detection, transport mode detection, mapping data inferences with the use of different methods such as image processing and machine learning methods. While the data size increases, efficient representation of this type of data is becoming difficult to be used in these methods. A common approach is the representation of GPS trajectory information such as average speed, bearing, etc. in raster image form and applying analysis methods. In this study, we evaluate GPS trajectory data rasterization using the spatial join functions of QGIS, PostGIS+QGIS, and our iterative spatial structured grid aggregation implementation coded in the Python programming language. Our implementation is also parallelizable, and this parallelization is also included as the fourth method. According to the results of experiment carried out with an example GPS trajectory dataset, QGIS method and PostGIS+QGIS method showed relatively low performance with respect to our method using the metric of total processing time. PostGIS+QGIS method achieved the best results for spatial join though its total performance decreased quickly while test area size increases. On the other hand, both of our methods' performances decrease directly proportional to GPS point. And our methods' performance can be increased proportional to the increase with the number of processor cores and/or with multiple computing clusters.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of the retinogeniculate visual pathway (RGVP) aids in the diagnosis and treatment of visual disorders by identifying disruptions or abnormalities within the pathway. However, the complex anatomical structure and connectivity of RGVP make it challenging to achieve accurate segmentation. In this study, we propose a novel Modality Exchange Network (ME-Net) that effectively utilizes multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging information to enhance RGVP segmentation. Our ME-Net has two main contributions. Firstly, we introduce an effective multi-modal soft-exchange technique. Specifically, we design a channel and spatially mixed attention module to exchange modality information between T1-weighted and fractional anisotropy MR images. Secondly, we propose a cross-fusion module that further enhances the fusion of information between the two modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of RGVP segmentation performance.

- **Summary**: Online contextual reasoning and association across consecutive video frames are critical to perceive instances in visual tracking. However, most current top-performing trackers persistently lean on sparse temporal relationships between reference and search frames via an offline mode. Consequently, they can only interact independently within each image-pair and establish limited temporal correlations. To alleviate the above problem, we propose a simple, flexible and effective video-level tracking pipeline, named \textbf{ODTrack}, which densely associates the contextual relationships of video frames in an online token propagation manner. ODTrack receives video frames of arbitrary length to capture the spatio-temporal trajectory relationships of an instance, and compresses the discrimination features (localization information) of a target into a token sequence to achieve frame-to-frame association. This new solution brings the following benefits: 1) the purified token sequences can serve as prompts for the inference in the next video frame, whereby past information is leveraged to guide future inference; 2) the complex online update strategies are effectively avoided by the iterative propagation of token sequences, and thus we can achieve more efficient model representation and computation. ODTrack achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance on seven benchmarks, while running at real-time speed. Code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/GXNU-ZhongLab/ODTrack}.

- **Summary**: Deep learning has shown great potential in accelerating diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nevertheless, existing methods tend to suffer from Rician noise and detail loss in reconstructing the DTI-derived parametric maps especially when sparsely sampled q-space data are used. This paper proposes a novel method, AID-DTI (Accelerating hIgh fiDelity Diffusion Tensor Imaging), to facilitate fast and accurate DTI with only six measurements. AID-DTI is equipped with a newly designed Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based regularizer, which can effectively capture fine details while suppressing noise during network training. Experimental results on Human Connectome Project (HCP) data consistently demonstrate that the proposed method estimates DTI parameter maps with fine-grained details and outperforms three state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces the WordArt Designer API, a novel framework for user-driven artistic typography synthesis utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) on ModelScope. We address the challenge of simplifying artistic typography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input, facilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and creative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing systems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography but also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and design.

- **Summary**: Monitoring cameras are extensively utilized in industrial production to monitor equipment running. With advancements in computer vision, device recognition using image features is viable. This paper presents a vision-assisted identification system that implements real-time automatic equipment labeling through image matching in surveillance videos. The system deploys the ORB algorithm to extract image features and the GMS algorithm to remove incorrect matching points. According to the principles of clustering and template locality, a method known as Local Adaptive Clustering (LAC) has been established to enhance label positioning. This method segments matching templates using the cluster center, which improves the efficiency and stability of labels. The experimental results demonstrate that LAC effectively curtails the label drift.

- **Summary**: JPEG is a widely used compression scheme to efficiently reduce the volume of transmitted images. The artifacts appear among blocks due to the information loss, which not only affects the quality of images but also harms the subsequent high-level tasks in terms of feature drifting. High-level vision models trained on high-quality images will suffer performance degradation when dealing with compressed images, especially on mobile devices. Numerous learning-based JPEG artifact removal methods have been proposed to handle visual artifacts. However, it is not an ideal choice to use these JPEG artifact removal methods as a pre-processing for compressed image classification for the following reasons: 1. These methods are designed for human vision rather than high-level vision models; 2. These methods are not efficient enough to serve as pre-processing on resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel lightweight AFD module to boost the performance of pre-trained image classification models when facing compressed images. First, a FDE-Net is devised to generate the spatial-wise FDM in the DCT domain. Next, the estimated FDM is transmitted to the FE-Net to generate the mapping relationship between degraded features and corresponding high-quality features. A simple but effective RepConv block equipped with structural re-parameterization is utilized in FE-Net, which enriches feature representation in the training phase while maintaining efficiency in the deployment phase. After training on limited compressed images, the AFD-Module can serve as a "plug-and-play" model for pre-trained classification models to improve their performance on compressed images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed AFD module can comprehensively improve the accuracy of the pre-trained classification models and significantly outperform the existing methods.

- **Summary**: The recovery of 3D human mesh from monocular images has significantly been developed in recent years. However, existing models usually ignore spatial and temporal information, which might lead to mesh and image misalignment and temporal discontinuity. For this reason, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Fusion (STAF) model. As a video-based model, it leverages coherence clues from human motion by an attention-based Temporal Coherence Fusion Module (TCFM). As for spatial mesh-alignment evidence, we extract fine-grained local information through predicted mesh projection on the feature maps. Based on the spatial features, we further introduce a multi-stage adjacent Spatial Alignment Fusion Module (SAFM) to enhance the feature representation of the target frame. In addition to the above, we propose an Average Pooling Module (APM) to allow the model to focus on the entire input sequence rather than just the target frame. This method can remarkably improve the smoothness of recovery results from video. Extensive experiments on 3DPW, MPII3D, and H36M demonstrate the superiority of STAF. We achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between precision and smoothness. Our code and more video results are on the project page https://yw0208.github.io/staf/

- **Summary**: Assistive robots should be able to wash, fold or iron clothes. However, due to the variety, deformability and self-occlusions of clothes, creating general-purpose robot systems for cloth manipulation is challenging. Synthetic data is a promising direction to improve generalization, though its usability is often limited by the sim-to-real gap. To advance the use of synthetic data for cloth manipulation and to enable tasks such as robotic folding, we present a synthetic data pipeline to train keypoint detectors for almost flattened cloth items. To test its performance, we have also collected a real-world dataset. We train detectors for both T-shirts, towels and shorts and obtain an average precision of 64.3%. Fine-tuning on real-world data improves performance to 74.2%. Additional insight is provided by discussing various failure modes of the keypoint detectors and by comparing different approaches to obtain cloth meshes and materials. We also quantify the remaining sim-to-real gap and argue that further improvements to the fidelity of cloth assets will be required to further reduce this gap. The code, dataset and trained models are available online.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal (vision-language) models, such as CLIP, are replacing traditional supervised pre-training models (e.g., ImageNet-based pre-training) as the new generation of visual foundation models. These models with robust and aligned semantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and can be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in some fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the performance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired. Consequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation methods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches: 1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external knowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has produced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically organize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and analyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for multi-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups, and comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of reliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot adaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem reveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is constrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size. Based on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects: 1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive knowledge utilization.

- **Summary**: Images generated by most of generative models trained with limited data often exhibit deficiencies in either fidelity, diversity, or both. One effective solution to address the limitation is few-shot generative model adaption. However, the type of approaches typically rely on a large-scale pre-trained model, serving as a source domain, to facilitate information transfer to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a method called Information Transfer from the Built Geodesic Surface (ITBGS), which contains two module: Feature Augmentation on Geodesic Surface (FAGS); Interpolation and Regularization (I\&R). With the FAGS module, a pseudo-source domain is created by projecting image features from the training dataset into the Pre-Shape Space, subsequently generating new features on the Geodesic surface. Thus, no pre-trained models is needed for the adaption process during the training of generative models with FAGS. I\&R module are introduced for supervising the interpolated images and regularizing their relative distances, respectively, to further enhance the quality of generated images. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves optimal or comparable results across a diverse range of semantically distinct datasets, even in extremely few-shot scenarios.

- **Summary**: The attention mechanism has been proven effective on various visual tasks in recent years. In the semantic segmentation task, the attention mechanism is applied in various methods, including the case of both Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbones. However, we observe that the attention mechanism is vulnerable to patch-based adversarial attacks. Through the analysis of the effective receptive field, we attribute it to the fact that the wide receptive field brought by global attention may lead to the spread of the adversarial patch. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a Robust Attention Mechanism (RAM) to improve the robustness of the semantic segmentation model, which can notably relieve the vulnerability against patch-based attacks. Compared to the vallina attention mechanism, RAM introduces two novel modules called Max Attention Suppression and Random Attention Dropout, both of which aim to refine the attention matrix and limit the influence of a single adversarial patch on the semantic segmentation results of other positions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our RAM to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation models against various patch-based attack methods under different attack settings.

However, existing large models tend to prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness, which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop the novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms.   Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA-AT framework by integrating the learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner.   Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FullLoRA-AT framework. It achieves comparable robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5% of the learnable parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.

- **Summary**: With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.

- **Summary**: Visual scenes are extremely diverse, not only because there are infinite possible combinations of objects and backgrounds but also because the observations of the same scene may vary greatly with the change of viewpoints. When observing a multi-object visual scene from multiple viewpoints, humans can perceive the scene compositionally from each viewpoint while achieving the so-called ``object constancy'' across different viewpoints, even though the exact viewpoints are untold. This ability is essential for humans to identify the same object while moving and to learn from vision efficiently. It is intriguing to design models that have a similar ability. In this paper, we consider a novel problem of learning compositional scene representations from multiple unspecified (i.e., unknown and unrelated) viewpoints without using any supervision and propose a deep generative model which separates latent representations into a viewpoint-independent part and a viewpoint-dependent part to solve this problem. During the inference, latent representations are randomly initialized and iteratively updated by integrating the information in different viewpoints with neural networks. Experiments on several specifically designed synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed method can effectively learn from multiple unspecified viewpoints.

- **Summary**: We present aMUSEd, an open-source, lightweight masked image model (MIM) for text-to-image generation based on MUSE. With 10 percent of MUSE's parameters, aMUSEd is focused on fast image generation. We believe MIM is under-explored compared to latent diffusion, the prevailing approach for text-to-image generation. Compared to latent diffusion, MIM requires fewer inference steps and is more interpretable. Additionally, MIM can be fine-tuned to learn additional styles with only a single image. We hope to encourage further exploration of MIM by demonstrating its effectiveness on large-scale text-to-image generation and releasing reproducible training code. We also release checkpoints for two models which directly produce images at 256x256 and 512x512 resolutions.

- **Summary**: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become a transformative technology that can change our daily life. Currently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands are identified as the promising CAV connectivity solution. While it can provide high data rate, their realization faces many challenges such as high attenuation during mmWave signal propagation and mobility management. Existing solution has to initiate pilot signal to measure channel information, then apply signal processing to calculate the best narrow beam towards the receiver end to guarantee sufficient signal power. This process takes significant overhead and time, hence not suitable for vehicles. In this study, we propose an autonomous and low-cost testbed to collect extensive co-located mmWave signal and other sensors data such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), cameras, ultrasonic, etc, traditionally for ``automated'', to facilitate mmWave vehicular communications. Intuitively, these sensors can build a 3D map around the vehicle and signal propagation path can be estimated, eliminating iterative the process via pilot signals. This multimodal data fusion, together with AI, is expected to bring significant advances in ``connected'' research.

- **Summary**: We introduce the video detours problem for navigating instructional videos. Given a source video and a natural language query asking to alter the how-to video's current path of execution in a certain way, the goal is to find a related ''detour video'' that satisfies the requested alteration. To address this challenge, we propose VidDetours, a novel video-language approach that learns to retrieve the targeted temporal segments from a large repository of how-to's using video-and-text conditioned queries. Furthermore, we devise a language-based pipeline that exploits how-to video narration text to create weakly supervised training data. We demonstrate our idea applied to the domain of how-to cooking videos, where a user can detour from their current recipe to find steps with alternate ingredients, tools, and techniques. Validating on a ground truth annotated dataset of 16K samples, we show our model's significant improvements over best available methods for video retrieval and question answering, with recall rates exceeding the state of the art by 35%.

- **Summary**: Most existing video diffusion models (VDMs) are limited to mere text conditions. Thereby, they are usually lacking in control over visual appearance and geometry structure of the generated videos. This work presents Moonshot, a new video generation model that conditions simultaneously on multimodal inputs of image and text. The model builts upon a core module, called multimodal video block (MVB), which consists of conventional spatialtemporal layers for representing video features, and a decoupled cross-attention layer to address image and text inputs for appearance conditioning. In addition, we carefully design the model architecture such that it can optionally integrate with pre-trained image ControlNet modules for geometry visual conditions, without needing of extra training overhead as opposed to prior methods. Experiments show that with versatile multimodal conditioning mechanisms, Moonshot demonstrates significant improvement on visual quality and temporal consistency compared to existing models. In addition, the model can be easily repurposed for a variety of generative applications, such as personalized video generation, image animation and video editing, unveiling its potential to serve as a fundamental architecture for controllable video generation. Models will be made public on https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS.

- **Summary**: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is challenging due to the significant cross-modality discrepancies between visible and infrared images. While existing methods have focused on designing complex network architectures or using metric learning constraints to learn modality-invariant features, they often overlook which specific component of the image causes the modality discrepancy problem. In this paper, we first reveal that the difference in the amplitude component of visible and infrared images is the primary factor that causes the modality discrepancy and further propose a novel Frequency Domain modality-invariant feature learning framework (FDMNet) to reduce modality discrepancy from the frequency domain perspective. Our framework introduces two novel modules, namely the Instance-Adaptive Amplitude Filter (IAF) module and the Phrase-Preserving Normalization (PPNorm) module, to enhance the modality-invariant amplitude component and suppress the modality-specific component at both the image- and feature-levels. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate the superior performance of our FDMNet against state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: This paper presents a new synthetic dataset of ID and travel documents, called SIDTD. The SIDTD dataset is created to help training and evaluating forged ID documents detection systems. Such a dataset has become a necessity as ID documents contain personal information and a public dataset of real documents can not be released. Moreover, forged documents are scarce, compared to legit ones, and the way they are generated varies from one fraudster to another resulting in a class of high intra-variability. In this paper we trained state-of-the-art models on this dataset and we compare them to the performance achieved in larger, but private, datasets. The creation of this dataset will help to document image analysis community to progress in the task of ID document verification.

- **Summary**: What does learning to model relationships between strings teach large language models (LLMs) about the visual world? We systematically evaluate LLMs' abilities to generate and recognize an assortment of visual concepts of increasing complexity and then demonstrate how a preliminary visual representation learning system can be trained using models of text. As language models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels, we use code to represent images in our study. Although LLM-generated images do not look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore, experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning, utilizing images generated with text models, highlight the potential to train vision models capable of making semantic assessments of natural images using just LLMs.

- **Summary**: With an aging population, numerous assistive and monitoring technologies are under development to enable older adults to age in place. To facilitate aging in place predicting risk factors such as falls, and hospitalization and providing early interventions are important. Much of the work on ambient monitoring for risk prediction has centered on gait speed analysis, utilizing privacy-preserving sensors like radar. Despite compelling evidence that monitoring step length, in addition to gait speed, is crucial for predicting risk, radar-based methods have not explored step length measurement in the home. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on step length measurement using radars are limited to proof of concept studies with few healthy subjects. To address this gap, a radar-based step length measurement system for the home is proposed based on detection and tracking using radar point cloud, followed by Doppler speed profiling of the torso to obtain step lengths in the home. The proposed method was evaluated in a clinical environment, involving 35 frail older adults, to establish its validity. Additionally, the method was assessed in people's homes, with 21 frail older adults who had participated in the clinical assessment. The proposed radar-based step length measurement method was compared to the gold standard Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis System, revealing a 4.5cm/8.3% error in a clinical setting. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent reliability (ICC(2,k)=0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96) in uncontrolled home settings. The method also proved accurate in uncontrolled home settings, as indicated by a strong agreement (ICC(3,k)=0.81 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92)) between home measurements and in-clinic assessments.

- **Summary**: We present a framework for generating full-bodied photorealistic avatars that gesture according to the conversational dynamics of a dyadic interaction. Given speech audio, we output multiple possibilities of gestural motion for an individual, including face, body, and hands. The key behind our method is in combining the benefits of sample diversity from vector quantization with the high-frequency details obtained through diffusion to generate more dynamic, expressive motion. We visualize the generated motion using highly photorealistic avatars that can express crucial nuances in gestures (e.g. sneers and smirks). To facilitate this line of research, we introduce a first-of-its-kind multi-view conversational dataset that allows for photorealistic reconstruction. Experiments show our model generates appropriate and diverse gestures, outperforming both diffusion- and VQ-only methods. Furthermore, our perceptual evaluation highlights the importance of photorealism (vs. meshes) in accurately assessing subtle motion details in conversational gestures.

- **Summary**: Visual odometry estimates the motion of a moving camera based on visual input. Existing methods, mostly focusing on two-view point tracking, often ignore the rich temporal context in the image sequence, thereby overlooking the global motion patterns and providing no assessment of the full trajectory reliability. These shortcomings hinder performance in scenarios with occlusion, dynamic objects, and low-texture areas. To address these challenges, we present the Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking (LEAP) module. LEAP innovatively combines visual, inter-track, and temporal cues with mindfully selected anchors for dynamic track estimation. Moreover, LEAP's temporal probabilistic formulation integrates distribution updates into a learnable iterative refinement module to reason about point-wise uncertainty. Based on these traits, we develop LEAP-VO, a robust visual odometry system adept at handling occlusions and dynamic scenes. Our mindful integration showcases a novel practice by employing long-term point tracking as the front-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms existing baselines across various visual odometry benchmarks.

- **Summary**: The enduring inability of image generative models to recreate intricate geometric features, such as those present in human hands and fingers has been an ongoing problem in image generation for nearly a decade. While strides have been made by increasing model sizes and diversifying training datasets, this issue remains prevalent across all models, from denoising diffusion models to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), pointing to a fundamental shortcoming in the underlying architectures. In this paper, we demonstrate how this problem can be mitigated by augmenting convolution layers geometric capabilities through providing them with a single input channel incorporating the relative $n$-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. We show that this drastically improves quality of hand and face images generated by GANs and Variational AutoEncoders (VAE).

- **Summary**: This paper presents instruct-imagen, a model that tackles heterogeneous image generation tasks and generalizes across unseen tasks. We introduce *multi-modal instruction* for image generation, a task representation articulating a range of generation intents with precision. It uses natural language to amalgamate disparate modalities (e.g., text, edge, style, subject, etc.), such that abundant generation intents can be standardized in a uniform format.   We then build instruct-imagen by fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with a two-stage framework. First, we adapt the model using the retrieval-augmented training, to enhance model's capabilities to ground its generation on external multimodal context. Subsequently, we fine-tune the adapted model on diverse image generation tasks that requires vision-language understanding (e.g., subject-driven generation, etc.), each paired with a multi-modal instruction encapsulating the task's essence. Human evaluation on various image generation datasets reveals that instruct-imagen matches or surpasses prior task-specific models in-domain and demonstrates promising generalization to unseen and more complex tasks.

- **Summary**: Precisely perceiving the geometric and semantic properties of real-world 3D objects is crucial for the continued evolution of augmented reality and robotic applications. To this end, we present \algfull{} (\algname{}), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the rendered feature distance of same semantic entities close, following the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks, beating state-of-the-art methods by $\mathbf{10.2}$ percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are $\mathbf{851\times}$ faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments. We plan to release the code upon paper acceptance.

- **Summary**: Visual reasoning is dominated by end-to-end neural networks scaled to billions of model parameters and training examples. However, even the largest models struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained spatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these limitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set of (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks such as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video temporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily rely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often dataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled programmers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues by introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a small number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples, thereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual reasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in performance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need for human engineering of in-context examples.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in visual anomaly detection research have seen AUROC and AUPRO scores on public benchmark datasets such as MVTec and VisA converge towards perfect recall, giving the impression that these benchmarks are near-solved. However, high AUROC and AUPRO scores do not always reflect qualitative performance, which limits the validity of these metrics in real-world applications. We argue that the artificial ceiling imposed by the lack of an adequate evaluation metric restrains progression of the field, and it is crucial that we revisit the evaluation metrics used to rate our algorithms. In response, we introduce Per-IMage Overlap (PIMO), a novel metric that addresses the shortcomings of AUROC and AUPRO. PIMO retains the recall-based nature of the existing metrics but introduces two distinctions: the assignment of curves (and respective area under the curve) is per-image, and its X-axis relies solely on normal images. Measuring recall per image simplifies instance score indexing and is more robust to noisy annotations. As we show, it also accelerates computation and enables the usage of statistical tests to compare models. By imposing low tolerance for false positives on normal images, PIMO provides an enhanced model validation procedure and highlights performance variations across datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that PIMO offers practical advantages and nuanced performance insights that redefine anomaly detection benchmarks -- notably challenging the perception that MVTec AD and VisA datasets have been solved by contemporary models.

Current SSL methods leverage Data-Augmentations (DA) for generating positive samples and incorporate prior knowledge - an incorrect, or too weak DA will drastically reduce the quality of the learned representation. GPS-SSL proposes instead to design a metric space where Euclidean distances become a meaningful proxy for semantic relationship. In that space, it is now possible to generate positive samples from nearest neighbor sampling. Any prior knowledge can now be embedded into that metric space independently from the employed DA. From its simplicity, GPS-SSL is applicable to any SSL method, e.g. SimCLR or BYOL. A key benefit of GPS-SSL is in reducing the pressure in tailoring strong DAs. For example GPS-SSL reaches 85.58% on Cifar10 with weak DA while the baseline only reaches 37.51%. We therefore move a step forward towards the goal of making SSL less reliant on DA. We also show that even when using strong DAs, GPS-SSL outperforms the baselines on under-studied domains. We evaluate GPS-SSL along with multiple baseline SSL methods on numerous downstream datasets from different domains when the models use strong or minimal data augmentations. We hope that GPS-SSL will open new avenues in studying how to inject a priori knowledge into SSL in a principled manner.

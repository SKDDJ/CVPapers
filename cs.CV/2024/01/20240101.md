- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on the One-shot Novel View Synthesis (O-NVS) task which targets synthesizing photo-realistic novel views given only one reference image per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields (OG-NeRF) methods solve this task in an inference-time finetuning-free manner, yet suffer the blurry issue due to the encoder-only architecture that highly relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD$^2$-NeRF, a Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail, following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD$^2$-NeRF is mainly composed of a One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer (Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D consistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that GD$^2$-NeRF noticeably improves the details while without per-scene finetuning.

- **Summary**: Deep Metric Learning (DML) plays an important role in modern computer vision research, where we learn a distance metric for a set of image representations. Recent DML techniques utilize the proxy to interact with the corresponding image samples in the embedding space. However, existing proxy-based DML methods focus on learning individual proxy-to-sample distance while the overall distribution of samples and proxies lacks attention. In this paper, we present a novel proxy-based DML framework that focuses on aligning the sample and proxy distributions to improve the efficiency of proxy-based DML losses. Specifically, we propose the Data-Augmented Domain Adaptation (DADA) method to adapt the domain gap between the group of samples and proxies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage domain adaptation to boost the performance of proxy-based DML. We show that our method can be easily plugged into existing proxy-based DML losses. Our experiments on benchmarks, including the popular CUB-200-2011, CARS196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes Retrieval, show that our learning algorithm significantly improves the existing proxy losses and achieves superior results compared to the existing methods.

- **Summary**: Window-based transformers have demonstrated strong ability in large-scale point cloud understanding by capturing context-aware representations with affordable attention computation in a more localized manner. However, because of the sparse nature of point clouds, the number of voxels per window varies significantly. Current methods partition the voxels in each window into multiple subsets of equal size, which cost expensive overhead in sorting and padding the voxels, making them run slower than sparse convolution based methods. In this paper, we present ScatterFormer, which, for the first time to our best knowledge, could directly perform attention on voxel sets with variable length. The key of ScatterFormer lies in the innovative Scatter Linear Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the linear attention mechanism to process in parallel all voxels scattered in different windows. Harnessing the hierarchical computation units of the GPU and matrix blocking algorithm, we reduce the latency of the proposed SLA module to less than 1 ms on moderate GPUs. Besides, we develop a cross-window interaction module to simultaneously enhance the local representation and allow the information flow across windows, eliminating the need for window shifting. Our proposed ScatterFormer demonstrates 73 mAP (L2) on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and 70.5 NDS on the NuScenes dataset, running at an outstanding detection rate of 28 FPS.

- **Summary**: Relative pose estimation for RGBD cameras is crucial in a number of applications. Previous approaches either rely on the RGB aspect of the images to estimate pose thus not fully making use of depth in the estimation process or estimate pose from the 3D cloud of points that each image produces, thus not making full use of RGB information. This paper shows that if one pair of correspondences is hypothesized from the RGB-based ranked-ordered correspondence list, then the space of remaining correspondences is restricted to corresponding pairs of curves nested around the hypothesized correspondence, implicitly capturing depth consistency. This simple Geometric Depth Constraint (GDC) significantly reduces potential matches. In effect this becomes a filter on possible correspondences that helps reduce the number of outliers and thus expedites RANSAC significantly. As such, the same budget of time allows for more RANSAC iterations and therefore additional robustness and a significant speedup. In addition, the paper proposed a Nested RANSAC approach that also speeds up the process, as shown through experiments on TUM, ICL-NUIM, and RGBD Scenes v2 datasets.

- **Summary**: Traditional video steganography methods are based on modifying the covert space for embedding, whereas we propose an innovative approach that embeds secret message within semantic feature for steganography during the video editing process. Although existing traditional video steganography methods display a certain level of security and embedding capacity, they lack adequate robustness against common distortions in online social networks (OSNs). In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end robust generative video steganography network (RoGVS), which achieves visual editing by modifying semantic feature of videos to embed secret message. We employ face-swapping scenario to showcase the visual editing effects. We first design a secret message embedding module to adaptively hide secret message into the semantic feature of videos. Extensive experiments display that the proposed RoGVS method applied to facial video datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing video and image steganography techniques in terms of both robustness and capacity.

- **Summary**: Deceptive images can be shared in seconds with social networking services, posing substantial risks. Tampering traces, such as boundary artifacts and high-frequency information, have been significantly emphasized by massive networks in the Image Manipulation Localization (IML) field. However, they are prone to image post-processing operations, which limit the generalization and robustness of existing methods. We present a novel Prompt-IML framework. We observe that humans tend to discern the authenticity of an image based on both semantic and high-frequency information, inspired by which, the proposed framework leverages rich semantic knowledge from pre-trained visual foundation models to assist IML. We are the first to design a framework that utilizes visual foundation models specially for the IML task. Moreover, we design a Feature Alignment and Fusion module to align and fuse features of semantic features with high-frequency features, which aims at locating tampered regions from multiple perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance on eight typical fake image datasets and outstanding robustness.

- **Summary**: The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained significant attention across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications. Incorporating the over-relaxation technique shows potential for enhancing the convergence rate of ADMM. However, determining optimal algorithmic parameters, including both the associated penalty and relaxation parameters, often relies on empirical approaches tailored to specific problem domains and contextual scenarios. Incorrect parameter selection can significantly hinder ADMM's convergence rate. To address this challenge, in this paper we first propose a general approach to optimize the value of penalty parameter, followed by a novel closed-form formula to compute the optimal relaxation parameter in the context of linear quadratic problems (LQPs). We then experimentally validate our parameter selection methods through random instantiations and diverse imaging applications, encompassing diffeomorphic image registration, image deblurring, and MRI reconstruction.

- **Summary**: The recent transformer-based models have dominated the Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) task due to the superior performance. Most prior works adopt unified DETR framework to generate segmentation masks in query-to-instance manner. In this work, we integrate strengths of that leading RVOS models to build up an effective paradigm. We first obtain binary mask sequences from the RVOS models. To improve the consistency and quality of masks, we propose Two-Stage Multi-Model Fusion strategy. Each stage rationally ensembles RVOS models based on framework design as well as training strategy, and leverages different video object segmentation (VOS) models to enhance mask coherence by object propagation mechanism. Our method achieves 75.7% J&F on Ref-Youtube-VOS validation set and 70% J&F on test set, which ranks 1st place on 5th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge (ICCV 2023) track 3.

- **Summary**: Cancer diagnosis is a well-studied problem in machine learning since early detection of cancer is often the determining factor in prognosis. Supervised deep learning achieves excellent results in cancer image classification, usually through transfer learning. However, these models require large amounts of labelled data and for several types of cancer, large labelled datasets do not exist. In this paper, we demonstrate that a model pre-trained using a self-supervised learning algorithm known as Barlow Twins can outperform the conventional supervised transfer learning pipeline. We juxtapose two base models: i) pretrained in a supervised fashion on ImageNet; ii) pretrained in a self-supervised fashion on ImageNet. Both are subsequently fine tuned on a small labelled skin lesion dataset and evaluated on a large test set. We achieve a mean test accuracy of 70\% for self-supervised transfer in comparison to 66\% for supervised transfer. Interestingly, boosting performance further is possible by self-supervised pretraining a second time (on unlabelled skin lesion images) before subsequent fine tuning. This hints at an alternative path to collecting more labelled data in settings where this is challenging - namely just collecting more unlabelled images. Our framework is applicable to cancer image classification models in the low-labelled data regime.

- **Summary**: Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) has achieved resounding success by leveraging unlabeled data to improve detection performance. However, in Open Scene Semi-Supervised Object Detection (O-SSOD), unlabeled data may contains unknown objects not observed in the labeled data, which will increase uncertainty in the model's predictions for known objects. It is detrimental to the current methods that mainly rely on self-training, as more uncertainty leads to the lower localization and classification precision of pseudo labels. To this end, we propose Credible Teacher, an end-to-end framework. Credible Teacher adopts an interactive teaching mechanism using flexible labels to prevent uncertain pseudo labels from misleading the model and gradually reduces its uncertainty through the guidance of other credible pseudo labels. Empirical results have demonstrated our method effectively restrains the adverse effect caused by O-SSOD and significantly outperforms existing counterparts.

- **Summary**: Try to generate new bridge types using generative artificial intelligence technology. Symmetric structured image dataset of three-span beam bridge, arch bridge, cable-stayed bridge and suspension bridge are used . Based on Python programming language, TensorFlow and Keras deep learning platform framework , as well as Wasserstein loss function and Lipschitz constraints, generative adversarial network is constructed and trained. From the obtained low dimensional bridge-type latent space sampling, new bridge types with asymmetric structures can be generated. Generative adversarial network can create new bridge types by organically combining different structural components on the basis of human original bridge types. It has a certain degree of human original ability. Generative artificial intelligence technology can open up imagination space and inspire humanity.



### Towards Efficient and Effective Text-to-Video Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Visual Representation Learning

- **Summary**: In recent years, text-to-video retrieval methods based on CLIP have experienced rapid development. The primary direction of evolution is to exploit the much wider gamut of visual and textual cues to achieve alignment. Concretely, those methods with impressive performance often design a heavy fusion block for sentence (words)-video (frames) interaction, regardless of the prohibitive computation complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches are not optimal in terms of feature utilization and retrieval efficiency. To address this issue, we adopt multi-granularity visual feature learning, ensuring the model's comprehensiveness in capturing visual content features spanning from abstract to detailed levels during the training phase. To better leverage the multi-granularity features, we devise a two-stage retrieval architecture in the retrieval phase. This solution ingeniously balances the coarse and fine granularity of retrieval content. Moreover, it also strikes a harmonious equilibrium between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, in training phase, we design a parameter-free text-gated interaction block (TIB) for fine-grained video representation learning and embed an extra Pearson Constraint to optimize cross-modal representation learning. In retrieval phase, we use coarse-grained video representations for fast recall of top-k candidates, which are then reranked by fine-grained video representations. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, our method achieves comparable performance with the current state-of-the-art methods while being nearly 50 times faster.



### Revisiting Nonlocal Self-Similarity from Continuous Representation

- **Summary**: Nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) is an important prior that has been successfully applied in multi-dimensional data processing tasks, e.g., image and video recovery. However, existing NSS-based methods are solely suitable for meshgrid data such as images and videos, but are not suitable for emerging off-meshgrid data, e.g., point cloud and climate data. In this work, we revisit the NSS from the continuous representation perspective and propose a novel Continuous Representation-based NonLocal method (termed as CRNL), which has two innovative features as compared with classical nonlocal methods. First, based on the continuous representation, our CRNL unifies the measure of self-similarity for on-meshgrid and off-meshgrid data and thus is naturally suitable for both of them. Second, the nonlocal continuous groups can be more compactly and efficiently represented by the coupled low-rank function factorization, which simultaneously exploits the similarity within each group and across different groups, while classical nonlocal methods neglect the similarity across groups. This elaborately designed coupled mechanism allows our method to enjoy favorable performance over conventional NSS methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive multi-dimensional data processing experiments on-meshgrid (e.g., image inpainting and image denoising) and off-meshgrid (e.g., climate data prediction and point cloud recovery) validate the versatility, effectiveness, and efficiency of our CRNL as compared with state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Generating 3D human models directly from text helps reduce the cost and time of character modeling. However, achieving multi-attribute controllable and realistic 3D human avatar generation is still challenging due to feature coupling and the scarcity of realistic 3D human avatar datasets. To address these issues, we propose Text2Avatar, which can generate realistic-style 3D avatars based on the coupled text prompts. Text2Avatar leverages a discrete codebook as an intermediate feature to establish a connection between text and avatars, enabling the disentanglement of features. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of realistic style 3D human avatar data, we utilize a pre-trained unconditional 3D human avatar generation model to obtain a large amount of 3D avatar pseudo data, which allows Text2Avatar to achieve realistic style generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate realistic 3D avatars from coupled textual data, which is challenging for other existing methods in this field.

- **Summary**: With the increasing availability of consumer depth sensors, 3D face recognition (FR) has attracted more and more attention. However, the data acquired by these sensors are often coarse and noisy, making them impractical to use directly. In this paper, we introduce an innovative Depth map denoising network (DMDNet) based on the Denoising Implicit Image Function (DIIF) to reduce noise and enhance the quality of facial depth images for low-quality 3D FR. After generating clean depth faces using DMDNet, we further design a powerful recognition network called Lightweight Depth and Normal Fusion network (LDNFNet), which incorporates a multi-branch fusion block to learn unique and complementary features between different modalities such as depth and normal images. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four distinct low-quality databases demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods. Furthermore, when combining DMDNet and LDNFNet, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the Lock3DFace database.

- **Summary**: Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for clinical quantification, disease diagnosis, treatment planning and many other applications. Both convolution-based and transformer-based u-shaped architectures have made significant success in various medical image segmentation tasks. The former can efficiently learn local information of images while requiring much more image-specific inductive biases inherent to convolution operation. The latter can effectively capture long-range dependency at different feature scales using self-attention, whereas it typically encounters the challenges of quadratic compute and memory requirements with sequence length increasing. To address this problem, through integrating the merits of these two paradigms in a well-designed u-shaped architecture, we propose a hybrid yet effective CNN-Transformer network, named BRAU-Net++, for an accurate medical image segmentation task. Specifically, BRAU-Net++ uses bi-level routing attention as the core building block to design our u-shaped encoder-decoder structure, in which both encoder and decoder are hierarchically constructed, so as to learn global semantic information while reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, this network restructures skip connection by incorporating channel-spatial attention which adopts convolution operations, aiming to minimize local spatial information loss and amplify global dimension-interaction of multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses other state-of-the-art methods including its baseline: BRAU-Net under almost all evaluation metrics. We achieve the average Dice-Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 82.47, 90.10, and 92.94 on Synapse multi-organ segmentation, ISIC-2018 Challenge, and CVC-ClinicDB, as well as the mIoU of 84.01 and 88.17 on ISIC-2018 Challenge and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.

- **Summary**: Chest X-ray imaging is a critical diagnostic tool for identifying pulmonary diseases. However, manual interpretation of these images is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated systems utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of chest X-ray image classification. While previous work has mainly focused on using feature maps from the final convolution layer, there is a need to explore the benefits of leveraging additional layers for improved disease classification. Extracting robust features from limited medical image datasets remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based multilayer multimodal fusion model that emphasizes extracting features from different layers and fusing them. Our disease detection model considers the discriminatory information captured by each layer. Furthermore, we propose the fusion of different-sized feature maps (FDSFM) module to effectively merge feature maps from diverse layers. The proposed model achieves a significantly higher accuracy of 97.21% and 99.60% for both three-class and two-class classifications, respectively. The proposed multilayer multimodal fusion model, along with the FDSFM module, holds promise for accurate disease classification and can also be extended to other disease classifications in chest X-ray images.

- **Summary**: Existing deep-learning-based methods for nighttime video deraining rely on synthetic data due to the absence of real-world paired data. However, the intricacies of the real world, particularly with the presence of light effects and low-light regions affected by noise, create significant domain gaps, hampering synthetic-trained models in removing rain streaks properly and leading to over-saturation and color shifts. Motivated by this, we introduce NightRain, a novel nighttime video deraining method with adaptive-rain-removal and adaptive-correction. Our adaptive-rain-removal uses unlabeled rain videos to enable our model to derain real-world rain videos, particularly in regions affected by complex light effects. The idea is to allow our model to obtain rain-free regions based on the confidence scores. Once rain-free regions and the corresponding regions from our input are obtained, we can have region-based paired real data. These paired data are used to train our model using a teacher-student framework, allowing the model to iteratively learn from less challenging regions to more challenging regions. Our adaptive-correction aims to rectify errors in our model's predictions, such as over-saturation and color shifts. The idea is to learn from clear night input training videos based on the differences or distance between those input videos and their corresponding predictions. Our model learns from these differences, compelling our model to correct the errors. From extensive experiments, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. It achieves a PSNR of 26.73dB, surpassing existing nighttime video deraining methods by a substantial margin of 13.7%.

- **Summary**: Self-supervised pre-training paradigms have been extensively explored in the field of skeleton-based action recognition. In particular, methods based on masked prediction have pushed the performance of pre-training to a new height. However, these methods take low-level features, such as raw joint coordinates or temporal motion, as prediction targets for the masked regions, which is suboptimal. In this paper, we show that using high-level contextualized features as prediction targets can achieve superior performance. Specifically, we propose Skeleton2vec, a simple and efficient self-supervised 3D action representation learning framework, which utilizes a transformer-based teacher encoder taking unmasked training samples as input to create latent contextualized representations as prediction targets. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the latent representations generated by the teacher encoder can incorporate the global context of the entire training samples, leading to a richer training task. Additionally, considering the high temporal correlations in skeleton sequences, we propose a motion-aware tube masking strategy which divides the skeleton sequence into several tubes and performs persistent masking within each tube based on motion priors, thus forcing the model to build long-range spatio-temporal connections and focus on action-semantic richer regions. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our proposed Skeleton2vec outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models (DMs) represent a significant advancement in image Super-Resolution (SR), aligning technical image quality more closely with human preferences and expanding SR applications. DMs address critical limitations of previous methods, enhancing overall realism and details in SR images. However, DMs suffer from color-shifting issues, and their high computational costs call for efficient sampling alternatives, underscoring the challenge of balancing computational efficiency and image quality. This survey gives an overview of DMs applied to image SR and offers a detailed analysis that underscores the unique characteristics and methodologies within this domain, distinct from broader existing reviews in the field. It presents a unified view of DM fundamentals and explores research directions, including alternative input domains, conditioning strategies, guidance, corruption spaces, and zero-shot methods. This survey provides insights into the evolution of image SR with DMs, addressing current trends, challenges, and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

- **Summary**: Text-conditioned image generation models are a prevalent use of AI image synthesis, yet intuitively controlling output guided by an artist remains challenging. Current methods require multiple images and textual prompts for each object to specify them as concepts to generate a single customized image.   On the other hand, our work, \verb|DiffMorph|, introduces a novel approach that synthesizes images that mix concepts without the use of textual prompts. Our work integrates a sketch-to-image module to incorporate user sketches as input. \verb|DiffMorph| takes an initial image with conditioning artist-drawn sketches to generate a morphed image.   We employ a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and fine-tune it to reconstruct each image faithfully. We seamlessly merge images and concepts from sketches into a cohesive composition. The image generation capability of our work is demonstrated through our results and a comparison of these with prompt-based image generation.

- **Summary**: The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.

- **Summary**: Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel metamorphic testing framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on any changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a testing oracle that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. To evaluate the effectiveness of BiasPainter, we use BiasPainter to test five widely-used commercial image generation software and models, such as stable diffusion and Midjourney. Experimental results show that 100\% of the generated test cases can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models.

- **Summary**: It is challenging but highly desired to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus exclusively on specific restoration or enhancement tasks, being insufficient in exploiting multi-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/cszhilu1998/BracketIRE.

- **Summary**: Understanding human actions from videos of first-person view poses significant challenges. Most prior approaches explore representation learning on egocentric videos only, while overlooking the potential benefit of exploiting existing large-scale third-person videos. In this paper, (1) we develop EgoInstructor, a retrieval-augmented multimodal captioning model that automatically retrieves semantically relevant third-person instructional videos to enhance the video captioning of egocentric videos. (2) For training the cross-view retrieval module, we devise an automatic pipeline to discover ego-exo video pairs from distinct large-scale egocentric and exocentric datasets. (3) We train the cross-view retrieval module with a novel EgoExoNCE loss that pulls egocentric and exocentric video features closer by aligning them to shared text features that describe similar actions. (4) Through extensive experiments, our cross-view retrieval module demonstrates superior performance across seven benchmarks. Regarding egocentric video captioning, EgoInstructor exhibits significant improvements by leveraging third-person videos as references.

- **Summary**: In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to manually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using microscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic leukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types of leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This methodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a high propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and environmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent classifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte scale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid (HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as weights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module and then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus enhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the issue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable self-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and cross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the extraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The effectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR method are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte detection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets. Our source code and private WBCCD dataset are available at https://github.com/JustlfC03/MFDS-DETR.

- **Summary**: Deep learning is the current de facto state of the art in tomographic imaging. A common approach is to feed the result of a simple inversion, for example the backprojection, to a convolutional neural network (CNN) which then computes the reconstruction. Despite strong results on 'in-distribution' test data similar to the training data, backprojection from sparse-view data delocalizes singularities, so these approaches require a large receptive field to perform well. As a consequence, they overfit to certain global structures which leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Moreover, their memory complexity and training time scale unfavorably with image resolution, making them impractical for application at realistic clinical resolutions, especially in 3D: a standard U-Net requires a substantial 140GB of memory and 2600 seconds per epoch on a research-grade GPU when training on 1024x1024 images. In this paper, we introduce GLIMPSE, a local processing neural network for computed tomography which reconstructs a pixel value by feeding only the measurements associated with the neighborhood of the pixel to a simple MLP. While achieving comparable or better performance with successful CNNs like the U-Net on in-distribution test data, GLIMPSE significantly outperforms them on OOD samples while maintaining a memory footprint almost independent of image resolution; 5GB memory suffices to train on 1024x1024 images. Further, we built GLIMPSE to be fully differentiable, which enables feats such as recovery of accurate projection angles if they are out of calibration.

- **Summary**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in neural rendering-based novel view synthesis. However, NeRF suffers from severe visual quality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect conditions, such as poor illumination, defocus blurring, and lens aberrations. Especially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally captured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render sharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key challenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based NeRF, which requires tremendous computational time. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a grid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry images within half an hour of training. To do so, we used several grid-based kernels to accurately model the sharpness/blurriness of the scene. The sharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur kernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry images and have evaluated full-reference and non-reference metrics. The qualitative and quantitative results have revealed that our approach renders the sharp novel views with vivid colors and fine details, and it has considerably faster training time than the previous works.

- **Summary**: This paper presents GenH2R, a framework for learning generalizable vision-based human-to-robot (H2R) handover skills. The goal is to equip robots with the ability to reliably receive objects with unseen geometry handed over by humans in various complex trajectories. We acquire such generalizability by learning H2R handover at scale with a comprehensive solution including procedural simulation assets creation, automated demonstration generation, and effective imitation learning. We leverage large-scale 3D model repositories, dexterous grasp generation methods, and curve-based 3D animation to create an H2R handover simulation environment named \simabbns, surpassing the number of scenes in existing simulators by three orders of magnitude. We further introduce a distillation-friendly demonstration generation method that automatically generates a million high-quality demonstrations suitable for learning. Finally, we present a 4D imitation learning method augmented by a future forecasting objective to distill demonstrations into a visuo-motor handover policy. Experimental evaluations in both simulators and the real world demonstrate significant improvements (at least +10\% success rate) over baselines in all cases.

- **Summary**: Despite significant progress in deep learning-based optical flow methods, accurately estimating large displacements and repetitive patterns remains a challenge. The limitations of local features and similarity search patterns used in these algorithms contribute to this issue. Additionally, some existing methods suffer from slow runtime and excessive graphic memory consumption. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach based on the RAFT framework. The proposed Attention-based Feature Localization (AFL) approach incorporates the attention mechanism to handle global feature extraction and address repetitive patterns. It introduces an operator for matching pixels with corresponding counterparts in the second frame and assigning accurate flow values. Furthermore, an Amorphous Lookup Operator (ALO) is proposed to enhance convergence speed and improve RAFTs ability to handle large displacements by reducing data redundancy in its search operator and expanding the search space for similarity extraction. The proposed method, Efficient RAFT (Ef-RAFT),achieves significant improvements of 10% on the Sintel dataset and 5% on the KITTI dataset over RAFT. Remarkably, these enhancements are attained with a modest 33% reduction in speed and a mere 13% increase in memory usage. The code is available at: https://github.com/n3slami/Ef-RAFT

- **Summary**: Recent studies in Radiance Fields have paved the robust way for novel view synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly applicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we propose a novel real-time deblurring framework, deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the covariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct fine and sharp details from blurry images. A variety of experiments have been conducted on the benchmark, and the results have revealed the effectiveness of our approach for deblurring. Qualitative results are available at https://benhenryl.github.io/Deblurring-3D-Gaussian-Splatting/

- **Summary**: We present a lightweight and affordable motion capture method based on two smartwatches and a head-mounted camera. In contrast to the existing approaches that use six or more expert-level IMU devices, our approach is much more cost-effective and convenient. Our method can make wearable motion capture accessible to everyone everywhere, enabling 3D full-body motion capture in diverse environments. As a key idea to overcome the extreme sparsity and ambiguities of sensor inputs, we integrate 6D head poses obtained from the head-mounted cameras for motion estimation. To enable capture in expansive indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose an algorithm to track and update floor level changes to define head poses, coupled with a multi-stage Transformer-based regression module. We also introduce novel strategies leveraging visual cues of egocentric images to further enhance the motion capture quality while reducing ambiguities. We demonstrate the performance of our method on various challenging scenarios, including complex outdoor environments and everyday motions including object interactions and social interactions among multiple individuals.

- **Summary**: In the evolution of Vision-Language Pre-training, shifting from short-text comprehension to encompassing extended textual contexts is pivotal. Recent autoregressive vision-language models like \cite{flamingo, palme}, leveraging the long-context capability of Large Language Models, have excelled in few-shot text generation tasks but face challenges in alignment tasks. Addressing this gap, we introduce the contrastive loss into text generation models, presenting the COntrastive-Streamlined MultimOdal framework (\ModelName), strategically partitioning the language model into dedicated unimodal text processing and adept multimodal data handling components. \ModelName, our unified framework, merges unimodal and multimodal elements, enhancing model performance for tasks involving textual and visual data while notably reducing learnable parameters. However, these models demand extensive long-text datasets, yet the availability of high-quality long-text video datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, this work introduces \VideoDatasetName, an inaugural interleaved video-text dataset featuring comprehensive captions, marking a significant step forward. Demonstrating its impact, we illustrate how \VideoDatasetName{} enhances model performance in image-text tasks. With 34% learnable parameters and utilizing 72\% of the available data, our model demonstrates significant superiority over OpenFlamingo~\cite{openflamingo}. For instance, in the 4-shot flickr captioning task, performance notably improves from 57.2% to 65.\%. The contributions of \ModelName{} and \VideoDatasetName{} are underscored by notable performance gains across 14 diverse downstream datasets encompassing both image-text and video-text tasks.

Self-supervised methods hold the promise of training directly on real video, but typically perform worse. These include methods trained with warp error (i.e., color constancy) combined with smoothness terms, and methods that encourage cycle-consistency in the estimates (i.e., tracking backwards should yield the opposite trajectory as tracking forwards). In this work, we take on the challenge of improving state-of-the-art supervised models with self-supervised training. We find that when the initialization is supervised weights, most existing self-supervision techniques actually make performance worse instead of better, which suggests that the benefit of seeing the new data is overshadowed by the noise in the training signal. Focusing on obtaining a ``clean'' training signal from real-world unlabelled video, we propose to separate label-making and training into two distinct stages. In the first stage, we use the pre-trained model to estimate motion in a video, and then select the subset of motion estimates which we can verify with cycle-consistency. This produces a sparse but accurate pseudo-labelling of the video. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model to reproduce these outputs, while also applying augmentations on the input. We complement this boot-strapping method with simple techniques that densify and re-balance the pseudo-labels, ensuring that we do not merely train on ``easy'' tracks. We show that our method yields reliable gains over fully-supervised methods in real videos, for both short-term (flow-based) and long-range (multi-frame) pixel tracking.

- **Summary**: We present a differentiable model that explicitly models boundaries -- including contours, corners and junctions -- using a new mechanism that we call boundary attention. We show that our model provides accurate results even when the boundary signal is very weak or is swamped by noise. Compared to previous classical methods for finding faint boundaries, our model has the advantages of being differentiable; being scalable to larger images; and automatically adapting to an appropriate level of geometric detail in each part of an image. Compared to previous deep methods for finding boundaries via end-to-end training, it has the advantages of providing sub-pixel precision, being more resilient to noise, and being able to process any image at its native resolution and aspect ratio.

- **Summary**: The recognition of human activities based on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) enables contactless and visual privacy-preserving sensing in indoor environments. However, poor model generalization, due to varying environmental conditions and sensing hardware, is a well-known problem in this space. To address this issue, in this work, data augmentation techniques commonly used in image-based learning are applied to WiFi CSI to investigate their effects on model generalization performance in cross-scenario and cross-system settings. In particular, we focus on the generalization between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) through-wall scenarios, as well as on the generalization between different antenna systems, which remains under-explored. We collect and make publicly available a dataset of CSI amplitude spectrograms of human activities. Utilizing this data, an ablation study is conducted in which activity recognition models based on the EfficientNetV2 architecture are trained, allowing us to assess the effects of each augmentation on model generalization performance. The gathered results show that specific combinations of simple data augmentation techniques applied to CSI amplitude data can significantly improve cross-scenario and cross-system generalization.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have markedly enhanced the performance of computer vision tasks, yet the specialized nature of these networks often necessitates extensive data and high computational power. Addressing these requirements, this study presents a novel neural network model adept at optical character recognition (OCR) across diverse domains, leveraging the strengths of multi-task learning to improve efficiency and generalization. The model is designed to achieve rapid adaptation to new domains, maintain a compact size conducive to reduced computational resource demand, ensure high accuracy, retain knowledge from previous learning experiences, and allow for domain-specific performance improvements without the need to retrain entirely. Rigorous evaluation on open datasets has validated the model's ability to significantly lower the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing performance, indicating its potential as a scalable and adaptable solution in the field of computer vision, particularly for applications in optical text recognition.

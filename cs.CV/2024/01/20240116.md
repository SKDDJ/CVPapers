- **Summary**: The main challenge for small object detection algorithms is to ensure accuracy while pursuing real-time performance. The RT-DETR model performs well in real-time object detection, but performs poorly in small object detection accuracy. In order to compensate for the shortcomings of the RT-DETR model in small object detection, two key improvements are proposed in this study. Firstly, The RT-DETR utilises a Transformer that receives input solely from the final layer of Backbone features. This means that the Transformer's input only receives semantic information from the highest level of abstraction in the Deep Network, and ignores detailed information such as edges, texture or color gradients that are critical to the location of small objects at lower levels of abstraction. Including only deep features can introduce additional background noise. This can have a negative impact on the accuracy of small object detection. To address this issue, we propose the fine-grained path augmentation method. This method helps to locate small objects more accurately by providing detailed information to the deep network. So, the input to the transformer contains both semantic and detailed information. Secondly, In RT-DETR, the decoder takes feature maps of different levels as input after concatenating them with equal weight. However, this operation is not effective in dealing with the complex relationship of multi-scale information captured by feature maps of different sizes. Therefore, we propose an adaptive feature fusion algorithm that assigns learnable parameters to each feature map from different levels. This allows the model to adaptively fuse feature maps from different levels and effectively integrate feature information from different scales. This enhances the model's ability to capture object features at different scales, thereby improving the accuracy of detecting small objects.

- **Summary**: As 5G technology becomes increasingly established, the anticipation for 6G is growing, which promises to deliver faster and more reliable wireless connections via cutting-edge radio technologies. However, efficient management method of the large-scale antenna arrays deployed by those radio technologies is crucial. Traditional management methods are mainly reactive, usually based on feedback from users to adapt to the dynamic wireless channel. However, a more promising approach lies in the prediction of spatial channel state information (spatial-CSI), which is an all-inclusive channel characterization and consists of all the feasible line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), with the three-dimension (3D) trajectory, attenuation, phase shift, delay, and polarization of each path. Advances in hardware and neural networks make it possible to predict such spatial-CSI using precise environmental information, and further look into the possibility of holographic communication, which implies complete control over every aspect of the radio waves emitted. Based on the integration of holographic communication and digital twin, we proposed a new framework, digital radio twin, which takes advantages from both the digital world and deterministic control over radio waves, supporting a wide range of high-level applications. As a preliminary attempt towards this visionary direction, in this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to pinpoint the valid paths in a given environment, demonstrating promising results, and highlighting the potential of this approach in driving forward the evolution of 6G wireless communication technologies.

- **Summary**: Handwritten character recognition is a crucial task because of its abundant applications. The recognition task of Bangla handwritten characters is especially challenging because of the cursive nature of Bangla characters and the presence of compound characters with more than one way of writing. In this paper, a classification model based on the ensembling of several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), namely, BanglaNet is proposed to classify Bangla basic characters, compound characters, numerals, and modifiers. Three different models based on the idea of state-of-the-art CNN models like Inception, ResNet, and DenseNet have been trained with both augmented and non-augmented inputs. Finally, all these models are averaged or ensembled to get the finishing model. Rigorous experimentation on three benchmark Bangla handwritten characters datasets, namely, CMATERdb, BanglaLekha-Isolated, and Ekush has exhibited significant recognition accuracies compared to some recent CNN-based research. The top-1 recognition accuracies obtained are 98.40%, 97.65%, and 97.32%, and the top-3 accuracies are 99.79%, 99.74%, and 99.56% for CMATERdb, BanglaLekha-Isolated, and Ekush datasets respectively.

- **Summary**: 3D lanes offer a more comprehensive understanding of the road surface geometry than 2D lanes, thereby providing crucial references for driving decisions and trajectory planning. While many efforts aim to improve prediction accuracy, we recognize that an efficient network can bring results closer to lane modeling. However, if the modeling data is imprecise, the results might not accurately capture the real-world scenario. Therefore, accurate lane modeling is essential to align prediction results closely with the environment. This study centers on efficient and accurate lane modeling, proposing a joint modeling approach that combines Bezier curves and interpolation methods. Furthermore, based on this lane modeling approach, we developed a Global2Local Lane Matching method with Bezier Control-Point and Key-Point, which serve as a comprehensive solution that leverages hierarchical features with two mathematical models to ensure a precise match. We also introduce a novel 3D Spatial Constructor, representing an exploration of 3D surround-view lane detection research. The framework is suitable for front-view or surround-view 3D lane detection. By directly outputting the key points of lanes in 3D space, it overcomes the limitations of anchor-based methods, enabling accurate prediction of closed-loop or U-shaped lanes and effective adaptation to complex road conditions. This innovative method establishes a new benchmark in front-view 3D lane detection on the Openlane dataset and achieves competitive performance in surround-view 2D lane detection on the Argoverse2 dataset.

- **Summary**: Vision-based localization is a cost-effective and thus attractive solution for many intelligent mobile platforms. However, its accuracy and especially robustness still suffer from low illumination conditions, illumination changes, and aggressive motion. Event-based cameras are bio-inspired visual sensors that perform well in HDR conditions and have high temporal resolution, and thus provide an interesting alternative in such challenging scenarios. While purely event-based solutions currently do not yet produce satisfying mapping results, the present work demonstrates the feasibility of purely event-based tracking if an alternative sensor is permitted for mapping. The method relies on geometric 3D-2D registration of semi-dense maps and events, and achieves highly reliable and accurate cross-modal tracking results. Practically relevant scenarios are given by depth camera-supported tracking or map-based localization with a semi-dense map prior created by a regular image-based visual SLAM or structure-from-motion system. Conventional edge-based 3D-2D alignment is extended by a novel polarity-aware registration that makes use of signed time-surface maps (STSM) obtained from event streams. We furthermore introduce a novel culling strategy for occluded points. Both modifications increase the speed of the tracker and its robustness against occlusions or large view-point variations. The approach is validated on many real datasets covering the above-mentioned challenging conditions, and compared against similar solutions realised with regular cameras.

- **Summary**: The rise of large foundation models, trained on extensive datasets, is revolutionizing the field of AI. Models such as SAM, DALL-E2, and GPT-4 showcase their adaptability by extracting intricate patterns and performing effectively across diverse tasks, thereby serving as potent building blocks for a wide range of AI applications. Autonomous driving, a vibrant front in AI applications, remains challenged by the lack of dedicated vision foundation models (VFMs). The scarcity of comprehensive training data, the need for multi-sensor integration, and the diverse task-specific architectures pose significant obstacles to the development of VFMs in this field. This paper delves into the critical challenge of forging VFMs tailored specifically for autonomous driving, while also outlining future directions. Through a systematic analysis of over 250 papers, we dissect essential techniques for VFM development, including data preparation, pre-training strategies, and downstream task adaptation. Moreover, we explore key advancements such as NeRF, diffusion models, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and world models, presenting a comprehensive roadmap for future research. To empower researchers, we have built and maintained https://github.com/zhanghm1995/Forge_VFM4AD, an open-access repository constantly updated with the latest advancements in forging VFMs for autonomous driving.

- **Summary**: In recent years, the field of talking faces generation has attracted considerable attention, with certain methods adept at generating virtual faces that convincingly imitate human expressions. However, existing methods face challenges related to limited generalization, particularly when dealing with challenging identities. Furthermore, methods for editing expressions are often confined to a singular emotion, failing to adapt to intricate emotions. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes EmoTalker, an emotionally editable portraits animation approach based on the diffusion model. EmoTalker modifies the denoising process to ensure preservation of the original portrait's identity during inference. To enhance emotion comprehension from text input, Emotion Intensity Block is introduced to analyze fine-grained emotions and strengths derived from prompts. Additionally, a crafted dataset is harnessed to enhance emotion comprehension within prompts. Experiments show the effectiveness of EmoTalker in generating high-quality, emotionally customizable facial expressions.

- **Summary**: Accurate representation in media is known to improve the well-being of the people who consume it. Generative image models trained on large web-crawled datasets such as LAION are known to produce images with harmful stereotypes and misrepresentations of cultures. We improve inclusive representation in generated images by (1) engaging with communities to collect a culturally representative dataset that we call the Cross-Cultural Understanding Benchmark (CCUB) and (2) proposing a novel Self-Contrastive Fine-Tuning (SCoFT) method that leverages the model's known biases to self-improve. SCoFT is designed to prevent overfitting on small datasets, encode only high-level information from the data, and shift the generated distribution away from misrepresentations encoded in a pretrained model. Our user study conducted on 51 participants from 5 different countries based on their self-selected national cultural affiliation shows that fine-tuning on CCUB consistently generates images with higher cultural relevance and fewer stereotypes when compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline, which is further improved with our SCoFT technique.



### Robust Tiny Object Detection in Aerial Images amidst Label Noise

- **Summary**: Precise detection of tiny objects in remote sensing imagery remains a significant challenge due to their limited visual information and frequent occurrence within scenes. This challenge is further exacerbated by the practical burden and inherent errors associated with manual annotation: annotating tiny objects is laborious and prone to errors (i.e., label noise). Training detectors for such objects using noisy labels often leads to suboptimal performance, with networks tending to overfit on noisy labels. In this study, we address the intricate issue of tiny object detection under noisy label supervision. We systematically investigate the impact of various types of noise on network training, revealing the vulnerability of object detectors to class shifts and inaccurate bounding boxes for tiny objects. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a DeNoising Tiny Object Detector (DN-TOD), which incorporates a Class-aware Label Correction (CLC) scheme to address class shifts and a Trend-guided Learning Strategy (TLS) to handle bounding box noise. CLC mitigates inaccurate class supervision by identifying and filtering out class-shifted positive samples, while TLS reduces noisy box-induced erroneous supervision through sample reweighting and bounding box regeneration. Additionally, Our method can be seamlessly integrated into both one-stage and two-stage object detection pipelines. Comprehensive experiments conducted on synthetic (i.e., noisy AI-TOD-v2.0 and DOTA-v2.0) and real-world (i.e., AI-TOD) noisy datasets demonstrate the robustness of DN-TOD under various types of label noise. Notably, when applied to the strong baseline RFLA, DN-TOD exhibits a noteworthy performance improvement of 4.9 points under 40% mixed noise. Datasets, codes, and models will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: As deep learning (DL) continues to demonstrate its ability in radiological tasks, it is critical that we optimize clinical DL solutions to include safety. One of the principal concerns in the clinical adoption of DL tools is trust. This study aims to apply conformal prediction as a step toward trustworthiness for DL in radiology. This is a retrospective study of 491 non-contrast head CTs from the CQ500 dataset, in which three senior radiologists annotated slices containing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The dataset was split into definite and challenging subsets, where challenging images were defined to those in which there was disagreement among readers. A DL model was trained on 146 patients (10,815 slices) from the definite data (training dataset) to perform ICH localization and classification for five classes of ICH. To develop an uncertainty-aware DL model, 1,546 cases of the definite data (calibration dataset) was used for Mondrian conformal prediction (MCP). The uncertainty-aware DL model was tested on 8,401 definite and challenging cases to assess its ability to identify challenging cases. After the MCP procedure, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.920 for ICH classification on the test dataset. Additionally, it correctly identified 6,837 of the 6,856 total challenging cases as challenging (99.7% accuracy). It did not incorrectly label any definite cases as challenging. The uncertainty-aware ICH detector performs on par with state-of-the-art models. MCP's performance in detecting challenging cases demonstrates that it is useful in automated ICH detection and promising for trustworthiness in radiological DL.

- **Summary**: Fusing abundant satellite data with sparse ground measurements constitutes a major challenge in climate modeling. To address this, we propose a strategy to augment the training dataset by introducing unlabeled satellite images paired with pseudo-labels generated through a spatial interpolation technique known as ordinary kriging, thereby making full use of the available satellite data resources. We show that the proposed data augmentation strategy helps enhance the performance of the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) model by a reasonable amount, resulting in a noteworthy improvement in spatial correlation and a reduction in prediction error.

- **Summary**: In medical image diagnosis, fairness has become increasingly crucial. Without bias mitigation, deploying unfair AI would harm the interests of the underprivileged population and potentially tear society apart. Recent research addresses prediction biases in deep learning models concerning demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, and race) by utilizing demographic (sensitive attribute) information during training. However, many sensitive attributes naturally exist in dermatological disease images. If the trained model only targets fairness for a specific attribute, it remains unfair for other attributes. Moreover, training a model that can accommodate multiple sensitive attributes is impractical due to privacy concerns. To overcome this, we propose a method enabling fair predictions for sensitive attributes during the testing phase without using such information during training. Inspired by prior work highlighting the impact of feature entanglement on fairness, we enhance the model features by capturing the features related to the sensitive and target attributes and regularizing the feature entanglement between corresponding classes. This ensures that the model can only classify based on the features related to the target attribute without relying on features associated with sensitive attributes, thereby improving fairness and accuracy. Additionally, we use disease masks from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance the quality of the learned feature. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve fairness in classification compared to state-of-the-art methods in two dermatological disease datasets.

- **Summary**: Event cameras are neuromorphic sensors that capture asynchronous and sparse event stream when per-pixel brightness changes. The state-of-the-art processing methods for event signals typically aggregate events into a frame or a grid. However, events are dense in time, these works are limited to local information of events due to the stacking. In this paper, we present a novel spatiotemporal representation learning method which can capture the global correlations of all events in the event stream simultaneously by tensor decomposition. In addition, with the events are sparse in space, we propose an Elastic Net-incorporated tensor network (ENTN) model to obtain more spatial and temporal details about event stream. Empirically, the results indicate that our method can represent the spatiotemporal correlation of events with high quality, and can achieve effective results in applications like filtering noise compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Vein recognition has received increasing attention due to its high security and privacy. Recently, deep neural networks such as Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have been introduced for vein recognition and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Despite the recent advances, however, existing solutions for finger-vein feature extraction are still not optimal due to scarce training image samples. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial masking contrastive learning (AMCL) approach, that generates challenging samples to train a more robust contrastive learning model for the downstream palm-vein recognition task, by alternatively optimizing the encoder in the contrastive learning model and a set of latent variables. First, a huge number of masks are generated to train a robust generative adversarial network (GAN). The trained generator transforms a latent variable from the latent variable space into a mask space. Then, we combine the trained generator with a contrastive learning model to obtain our AMCL, where the generator produces challenging masking images to increase the contrastive loss and the contrastive learning model is trained based on the harder images to learn a more robust feature representation. After training, the trained encoder in the contrastive learning model is combined with a classification layer to build a classifier, which is further fine-tuned on labeled training data for vein recognition. The experimental results on three databases demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing contrastive learning approaches in terms of improving identification accuracy of vein classifiers and achieves state-of-the-art recognition results.

- **Summary**: Urban villages, defined as informal residential areas in or around urban centers, are characterized by inadequate infrastructures and poor living conditions, closely related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on poverty, adequate housing, and sustainable cities. Traditionally, governments heavily depend on field survey methods to monitor the urban villages, which however are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and possibly delayed. Thanks to widely available and timely updated satellite images, recent studies develop computer vision techniques to detect urban villages efficiently. However, existing studies either focus on simple urban village image classification or fail to provide accurate boundary information. To accurately identify urban village boundaries from satellite images, we harness the power of the vision foundation model and adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to urban village segmentation, named UV-SAM. Specifically, UV-SAM first leverages a small-sized semantic segmentation model to produce mixed prompts for urban villages, including mask, bounding box, and image representations, which are then fed into SAM for fine-grained boundary identification. Extensive experimental results on two datasets in China demonstrate that UV-SAM outperforms existing baselines, and identification results over multiple years show that both the number and area of urban villages are decreasing over time, providing deeper insights into the development trends of urban villages and sheds light on the vision foundation models for sustainable cities. The dataset and codes of this study are available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UV-SAM.

- **Summary**: A large amount of User Generated Content (UGC) is uploaded to the Internet daily and displayed to people world-widely through the client side (e.g., mobile and PC). This requires the cropping algorithms to produce the aesthetic thumbnail within a specific aspect ratio on different devices. However, existing image cropping works mainly focus on landmark or landscape images, which fail to model the relations among the multi-objects with the complex background in UGC. Besides, previous methods merely consider the aesthetics of the cropped images while ignoring the content integrity, which is crucial for UGC cropping. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Semantic Collaborative cropping network (S2CNet) for arbitrary user generated content accompanied by a new cropping benchmark. Specifically, we first mine the visual genes of the potential objects. Then, the suggested adaptive attention graph recasts this task as a procedure of information association over visual nodes. The underlying spatial and semantic relations are ultimately centralized to the crop candidate through differentiable message passing, which helps our network efficiently to preserve both the aesthetics and the content integrity. Extensive experiments on the proposed UGCrop5K and other public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art counterparts.

- **Summary**: This study introduces a novel method for inpainting normal maps using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Normal maps, often derived from a lightstage, are crucial in performance capture but can have obscured areas due to movement (e.g., by arms, hair, or props). Inpainting fills these missing areas with plausible data. Our approach extends previous general image inpainting techniques, employing a bow tie-like generator network and a discriminator network, with alternating training phases. The generator aims to synthesize images aligning with the ground truth and deceive the discriminator, which differentiates between real and processed images. Periodically, the discriminator undergoes retraining to enhance its ability to identify processed images. Importantly, our method adapts to the unique characteristics of normal map data, necessitating modifications to the loss function. We utilize a cosine loss instead of mean squared error loss for generator training. Limited training data availability, even with synthetic datasets, demands significant augmentation, considering the specific nature of the input data. This includes appropriate image flipping and in-plane rotations to accurately alter normal vectors. Throughout training, we monitored key metrics such as average loss, Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for the generator, along with average loss and accuracy for the discriminator. Our findings suggest that the proposed model effectively generates high-quality, realistic inpainted normal maps, suitable for performance capture applications. These results establish a foundation for future research, potentially involving more advanced networks and comparisons with inpainting of source images used to create the normal maps.

- **Summary**: Early wildfire detection in remote and forest areas is crucial for minimizing devastation and preserving ecosystems. Autonomous drones offer agile access to remote, challenging terrains, equipped with advanced imaging technology that delivers both high-temporal and detailed spatial resolution, making them valuable assets in the early detection and monitoring of wildfires. However, the limited computation and battery resources of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) pose significant challenges in implementing robust and efficient image classification models. Current works in this domain often operate offline, emphasizing the need for solutions that can perform inference in real time, given the constraints of UAVs. To address these challenges, this paper aims to develop a real-time image classification and fire segmentation model. It presents a comprehensive investigation into hardware acceleration using the Jetson Nano P3450 and the implications of TensorRT, NVIDIA's high-performance deep-learning inference library, on fire classification accuracy and speed. The study includes implementations of Quantization Aware Training (QAT), Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and post-training mechanisms, comparing them against the latest baselines for fire segmentation and classification. All experiments utilize the FLAME dataset - an image dataset collected by low-altitude drones during a prescribed forest fire. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to enable real-time, on-board wildfire detection capabilities for UAVs, addressing speed and the computational and energy constraints of these crucial monitoring systems. The results show a 13% increase in classification speed compared to similar models without hardware optimization. Comparatively, loss and accuracy are within 1.225% of the original values.

- **Summary**: Opinion-Unaware Blind Image Quality Assessment (OU-BIQA) models aim to predict image quality without training on reference images and subjective quality scores. Thereinto, image statistical comparison is a classic paradigm, while the performance is limited by the representation ability of visual descriptors. Deep features as visual descriptors have advanced IQA in recent research, but they are discovered to be highly texture-biased and lack of shape-bias. On this basis, we find out that image shape and texture cues respond differently towards distortions, and the absence of either one results in an incomplete image representation. Therefore, to formulate a well-round statistical description for images, we utilize the shapebiased and texture-biased deep features produced by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) simultaneously. More specifically, we design a Shape-Texture Adaptive Fusion (STAF) module to merge shape and texture information, based on which we formulate qualityrelevant image statistics. The perceptual quality is quantified by the variant Mahalanobis Distance between the inner and outer Shape-Texture Statistics (DSTS), wherein the inner and outer statistics respectively describe the quality fingerprints of the distorted image and natural images. The proposed DSTS delicately utilizes shape-texture statistical relations between different data scales in the deep domain, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality prediction performance on images with artificial and authentic distortions.

- **Summary**: Contactless palmprints are comprised of both global and local discriminative features. Most prior work focuses on extracting global features or local features alone for palmprint matching, whereas this research introduces a novel framework that combines global and local features for enhanced palmprint matching accuracy. Leveraging recent advancements in deep learning, this study integrates a vision transformer (ViT) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract complementary local and global features. Next, a mobile-based, end-to-end palmprint recognition system is developed, referred to as Palm-ID. On top of the ViT and CNN features, Palm-ID incorporates a palmprint enhancement module and efficient dimensionality reduction (for faster matching). Palm-ID balances the trade-off between accuracy and latency, requiring just 18ms to extract a template of size 516 bytes, which can be efficiently searched against a 10,000 palmprint gallery in 0.33ms on an AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core CPU utilizing 128-threads. Cross-database matching protocols and evaluations on large-scale operational datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, achieving a TAR of 98.06% at FAR=0.01% on a newly collected, time-separated dataset. To show a practical deployment of the end-to-end system, the entire recognition pipeline is embedded within a mobile device for enhanced user privacy and security.

- **Summary**: The inability to acquire clean high-resolution (HR) electron microscopy (EM) images over a large brain tissue volume hampers many neuroscience studies. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based image super-resolution (SR) approach to computationally reconstruct clean HR 3D-EM with a large field of view (FoV) from noisy low-resolution (LR) acquisition. Our contributions are I) Investigating training with no-clean references for $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ loss functions; II) Introducing a novel network architecture, named EMSR, for enhancing the resolution of LR EM images while reducing inherent noise; and, III) Comparing different training strategies including using acquired LR and HR image pairs, i.e., real pairs with no-clean references contaminated with real corruptions, the pairs of synthetic LR and acquired HR, as well as acquired LR and denoised HR pairs. Experiments with nine brain datasets showed that training with real pairs can produce high-quality super-resolved results, demonstrating the feasibility of training with non-clean references for both loss functions. Additionally, comparable results were observed, both visually and numerically, when employing denoised and noisy references for training. Moreover, utilizing the network trained with synthetically generated LR images from HR counterparts proved effective in yielding satisfactory SR results, even in certain cases, outperforming training with real pairs. The proposed SR network was compared quantitatively and qualitatively with several established SR techniques, showcasing either the superiority or competitiveness of the proposed method in mitigating noise while recovering fine details.

- **Summary**: The bio-inspired event cameras or dynamic vision sensors are capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes (called event-streams) in high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. However, the non-structural spatial-temporal event-streams make it challenging for providing intuitive visualization with rich semantic information for human vision. It calls for events-to-video (E2V) solutions which take event-streams as input and generate high quality video frames for intuitive visualization. However, current solutions are predominantly data-driven without considering the prior knowledge of the underlying statistics relating event-streams and video frames. It highly relies on the non-linearity and generalization capability of the deep neural networks, thus, is struggling on reconstructing detailed textures when the scenes are complex. In this work, we propose \textbf{E2HQV}, a novel E2V paradigm designed to produce high-quality video frames from events. This approach leverages a model-aided deep learning framework, underpinned by a theory-inspired E2V model, which is meticulously derived from the fundamental imaging principles of event cameras. To deal with the issue of state-reset in the recurrent components of E2HQV, we also design a temporal shift embedding module to further improve the quality of the video frames. Comprehensive evaluations on the real world event camera datasets validate our approach, with E2HQV, notably outperforming state-of-the-art approaches, e.g., surpassing the second best by over 40\% for some evaluation metrics.

- **Summary**: Guided depth super-resolution (GDSR) involves restoring missing depth details using the high-resolution RGB image of the same scene. Previous approaches have struggled with the heterogeneity and complementarity of the multi-modal inputs, and neglected the issues of modal misalignment, geometrical misalignment, and feature selection. In this study, we rethink some essential components in GDSR networks and propose a simple yet effective Dynamic Dual Alignment and Aggregation network (D2A2). D2A2 mainly consists of 1) a dynamic dual alignment module that adapts to alleviate the modal misalignment via a learnable domain alignment block and geometrically align cross-modal features by learning the offset; and 2) a mask-to-pixel feature aggregate module that uses the gated mechanism and pixel attention to filter out irrelevant texture noise from RGB features and combine the useful features with depth features. By combining the strengths of RGB and depth features while minimizing disturbance introduced by the RGB image, our method with simple reuse and redesign of basic components achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have gained popularity across various applications. However, they face challenges in the sparse view setting, lacking sufficient constraints from volume rendering. Reconstructing and understanding a 3D scene from sparse and unconstrained cameras is a long-standing problem in classical computer vision with diverse applications. While recent works have explored NeRFs in sparse, unconstrained view scenarios, their focus has been primarily on enhancing reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our approach takes a broader perspective by posing the question: "from where has each point been seen?" -- which gates how well we can understand and reconstruct it. In other words, we aim to determine the origin or provenance of each 3D point and its associated information under sparse, unconstrained views. We introduce ProvNeRF, a model that enriches a traditional NeRF representation by incorporating per-point provenance, modeling likely source locations for each point. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) for stochastic processes. Notably, our method is compatible with any pre-trained NeRF model and the associated training camera poses. We demonstrate that modeling per-point provenance offers several advantages, including uncertainty estimation, criteria-based view selection, and improved novel view synthesis, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Linear Array Pushbroom (LAP) imaging technology is widely used in the realm of remote sensing. However, images acquired through LAP always suffer from distortion and blur because of camera jitter. Traditional methods for restoring LAP images, such as algorithms estimating the point spread function (PSF), exhibit limited performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a Jitter-Aware Restoration Network (JARNet), to remove the distortion and blur in two stages. In the first stage, we formulate an Optical Flow Correction (OFC) block to refine the optical flow of the degraded LAP images, resulting in pre-corrected images where most of the distortions are alleviated. In the second stage, for further enhancement of the pre-corrected images, we integrate two jitter-aware techniques within the Spatial and Frequency Residual (SFRes) block: 1) introducing Coordinate Attention (CoA) to the SFRes block in order to capture the jitter state in orthogonal direction; 2) manipulating image features in both spatial and frequency domains to leverage local and global priors. Additionally, we develop a data synthesis pipeline, which applies Continue Dynamic Shooting Model (CDSM) to simulate realistic degradation in LAP images. Both the proposed JARNet and LAP image synthesis pipeline establish a foundation for addressing this intricate challenge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed two-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration models. Code is available at https://github.com/JHW2000/JARNet.

- **Summary**: Completely occluded and dense object instance segmentation (IS) is an important and challenging task. Although current amodal IS methods can predict invisible regions of occluded objects, they are difficult to directly predict completely occluded objects. For dense object IS, existing box-based methods are overly dependent on the performance of bounding box detection. In this paper, we propose CFNet, a coarse-to-fine IS framework for completely occluded and dense objects, which is based on box prompt-based segmentation foundation models (BSMs). Specifically, CFNet first detects oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) to distinguish instances and provide coarse localization information. Then, it predicts OBB prompt-related masks for fine segmentation. To predict completely occluded object instances, CFNet performs IS on occluders and utilizes prior geometric properties, which overcomes the difficulty of directly predicting completely occluded object instances. Furthermore, based on BSMs, CFNet reduces the dependence on bounding box detection performance, improving dense object IS performance. Moreover, we propose a novel OBB prompt encoder for BSMs. To make CFNet more lightweight, we perform knowledge distillation on it and introduce a Gaussian smoothing method for teacher targets. Experimental results demonstrate that CFNet achieves the best performance on both industrial and publicly available datasets.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a Key-point-guided Diffusion probabilistic Model (KDM) that gains precise control over images by manipulating the object's key-point. We propose a two-stage generative model incorporating an optical flow map as an intermediate output. By doing so, a dense pixel-wise understanding of the semantic relation between the image and sparse key point is configured, leading to more realistic image generation. Additionally, the integration of optical flow helps regulate the inter-frame variance of sequential images, demonstrating an authentic sequential image generation. The KDM is evaluated with diverse key-point conditioned image synthesis tasks, including facial image generation, human pose synthesis, and echocardiography video prediction, demonstrating the KDM is proving consistency enhanced and photo-realistic images compared with state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: Rainy weather will have a significant impact on the regular operation of the imaging system. Based on this premise, image rain removal has always been a popular branch of low-level visual tasks, especially methods using deep neural networks. However, most neural networks are but-branched, such as only using convolutional neural networks or Transformers, which is unfavourable for the multidimensional fusion of image features. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a dual-branch attention fusion network. Firstly, a two-branch network structure is proposed. Secondly, an attention fusion module is proposed to selectively fuse the features extracted by the two branches rather than simply adding them. Finally, complete ablation experiments and sufficient comparison experiments prove the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Image compression constitutes a significant challenge amidst the era of information explosion. Recent studies employing deep learning methods have demonstrated the superior performance of learning-based image compression methods over traditional codecs. However, an inherent challenge associated with these methods lies in their lack of interpretability. Following an analysis of the varying degrees of compression degradation across different frequency bands, we propose the end-to-end optimized image compression model facilitated by the frequency-oriented transform. The proposed end-to-end image compression model consists of four components: spatial sampling, frequency-oriented transform, entropy estimation, and frequency-aware fusion. The frequency-oriented transform separates the original image signal into distinct frequency bands, aligning with the human-interpretable concept. Leveraging the non-overlapping hypothesis, the model enables scalable coding through the selective transmission of arbitrary frequency components. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our model outperforms all traditional codecs including next-generation standard H.266/VVC on MS-SSIM metric. Moreover, visual analysis tasks (i.e., object detection and semantic segmentation) are conducted to verify the proposed compression method could preserve semantic fidelity besides signal-level precision.

- **Summary**: Single Image Super-Resolution is a classic computer vision problem that involves estimating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) ones. Although deep neural networks (DNNs), especially Transformers for super-resolution, have seen significant advancements in recent years, challenges still remain, particularly in limited receptive field caused by window-based self-attention. To address these issues, we introduce a group of auxiliary Adapeive Token Dictionary to SR Transformer and establish an ATD-SR method. The introduced token dictionary could learn prior information from training data and adapt the learned prior to specific testing image through an adaptive refinement step. The refinement strategy could not only provide global information to all input tokens but also group image tokens into categories. Based on category partitions, we further propose a category-based self-attention mechanism designed to leverage distant but similar tokens for enhancing input features. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance on various single image super-resolution benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D point cloud classification has made significant progress with the help of many datasets. However, these datasets do not reflect the incomplete nature of real-world point clouds caused by occlusion, which limits the practical application of current methods. To bridge this gap, we propose ModelNet-O, a large-scale synthetic dataset of 123,041 samples that emulate real-world point clouds with self-occlusion caused by scanning from monocular cameras. ModelNet-O is 10 times larger than existing datasets and offers more challenging cases to evaluate the robustness of existing methods. Our observation on ModelNet-O reveals that well-designed sparse structures can preserve structural information of point clouds under occlusion, motivating us to propose a robust point cloud processing method that leverages a critical point sampling (CPS) strategy in a multi-level manner. We term our method PointMLS. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PointMLS achieves state-of-the-art results on ModelNet-O and competitive results on regular datasets, and it is robust and effective. More experiments also demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of PointMLS.

- **Summary**: Leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to simulate human behaviors when processing multimodal information, especially in the context of social media, has garnered immense interest due to its broad potential and far-reaching implications. Emojis, as one of the most unique aspects of digital communication, are pivotal in enriching and often clarifying the emotional and tonal dimensions. Yet, there is a notable gap in understanding how these advanced models, such as GPT-4V, interpret and employ emojis in the nuanced context of online interaction. This study intends to bridge this gap by examining the behavior of GPT-4V in replicating human-like use of emojis. The findings reveal a discernible discrepancy between human and GPT-4V behaviors, likely due to the subjective nature of human interpretation and the limitations of GPT-4V's English-centric training, suggesting cultural biases and inadequate representation of non-English cultures.

- **Summary**: Natural Language Video Localization (NLVL), grounding phrases from natural language descriptions to corresponding video segments, is a complex yet critical task in video understanding. Despite ongoing advancements, many existing solutions lack the capability to globally capture temporal dynamics of the video data. In this study, we present a novel approach to NLVL that aims to address this issue. Our method involves the direct generation of a global 2D temporal map via a conditional denoising diffusion process, based on the input video and language query. The main challenges are the inherent sparsity and discontinuity of a 2D temporal map in devising the diffusion decoder. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-scale technique and develop an innovative diffusion decoder. Our approach effectively encapsulates the interaction between the query and video data across various time scales. Experiments on the Charades and DiDeMo datasets underscore the potency of our design.

- **Summary**: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized many procedures and led to reduced recovery time and risk of patient injury. However, MIS poses additional complexity and burden on surgical teams. Data-driven surgical vision algorithms are thought to be key building blocks in the development of future MIS systems with improved autonomy. Recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision have led to successful applications in analyzing videos obtained from MIS with the promise of alleviating challenges in MIS videos. Surgical scene and action understanding encompasses multiple related tasks that, when solved individually, can be memory-intensive, inefficient, and fail to capture task relationships. Multitask learning (MTL), a learning paradigm that leverages information from multiple related tasks to improve performance and aid generalization, is wellsuited for fine-grained and high-level understanding of MIS data. This review provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art MTL systems that leverage videos obtained from MIS. Beyond listing published approaches, we discuss the benefits and limitations of these MTL systems. Moreover, this manuscript presents an analysis of the literature for various application fields of MTL in MIS, including those with large models, highlighting notable trends, new directions of research, and developments.

- **Summary**: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of robot navigation and localization systems that allows them to identify a place using only image data. VPR is challenging due to the significant changes in a place's appearance driven by different daily illumination, seasonal weather variations and diverse viewpoints. Currently, no single VPR technique excels in every environmental condition, each exhibiting unique benefits and shortcomings, and therefore combining multiple techniques can achieve more reliable VPR performance. Present multi-method approaches either rely on online ground-truth information, which is often not available, or on brute-force technique combination, potentially lowering performance with high variance technique sets. Addressing these shortcomings, we propose a VPR system dubbed Multi-Sequential Information Consistency (MuSIC) which leverages sequential information to select the most cohesive technique on an online per-frame basis. For each technique in a set, MuSIC computes their respective sequential consistencies by analysing the frame-to-frame continuity of their top match candidates, which are then directly compared to select the optimal technique for the current query image. The use of sequential information to select between VPR methods results in an overall VPR performance increase across different benchmark datasets, while avoiding the need for extra ground-truth of the runtime environment.



### Siamese Content-based Search Engine for a More Transparent Skin and Breast Cancer Diagnosis through Histological Imaging

- **Summary**: Computer Aid Diagnosis (CAD) has developed digital pathology with Deep Learning (DL)-based tools to assist pathologists in decision-making. Content-Based Histopathological Image Retrieval (CBHIR) is a novel tool to seek highly correlated patches in terms of similarity in histopathological features. In this work, we proposed two CBHIR approaches on breast (Breast-twins) and skin cancer (Skin-twins) data sets for robust and accurate patch-level retrieval, integrating a custom-built Siamese network as a feature extractor. The proposed Siamese network is able to generalize for unseen images by focusing on the similar histopathological features of the input pairs. The proposed CBHIR approaches are evaluated on the Breast (public) and Skin (private) data sets with top K accuracy. Finding the optimum amount of K is challenging, but also, as much as K increases, the dissimilarity between the query and the returned images increases which might mislead the pathologists. To the best of the author's belief, this paper is tackling this issue for the first time on histopathological images by evaluating the top first retrieved images. The Breast-twins model achieves 70% of the F1score at the top first, which exceeds the other state-of-the-art methods at a higher amount of K such as 5 and 400. Skin-twins overpasses the recently proposed Convolutional Auto Encoder (CAE) by 67%, increasing the precision. Besides, the Skin-twins model tackles the challenges of Spitzoid Tumors of Uncertain Malignant Potential (STUMP) to assist pathologists with retrieving top K images and their corresponding labels. So, this approach can offer a more explainable CAD tool to pathologists in terms of transparency, trustworthiness, or reliability among other characteristics.

- **Summary**: Face anti-spoofing is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of face recognition systems. Several existing face anti-spoofing methods utilize GAN-like networks to detect presentation attacks by estimating the noise pattern of a spoof image and recovering the corresponding genuine image. But GAN's limited face appearance space results in the denoised faces cannot cover the full data distribution of genuine faces, thereby undermining the generalization performance of such methods. In this work, we present a pioneering attempt to employ diffusion models to denoise a spoof image and restore the genuine image. The difference between these two images is considered as the spoof noise, which can serve as a discriminative cue for face anti-spoofing. We evaluate our proposed method on several intra-testing and inter-testing protocols, where the experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our method in achieving competitive performance in terms of both accuracy and generalization.

- **Summary**: With collective endeavors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are undergoing a flourishing development. However, their performances on image aesthetics perception remain indeterminate, which is highly desired in real-world applications. An obvious obstacle lies in the absence of a specific benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs on aesthetic perception. This blind groping may impede the further development of more advanced MLLMs with aesthetic perception capacity. To address this dilemma, we propose AesBench, an expert benchmark aiming to comprehensively evaluate the aesthetic perception capacities of MLLMs through elaborate design across dual facets. (1) We construct an Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD), which features diversified image contents and high-quality annotations provided by professional aesthetic experts. (2) We propose a set of integrative criteria to measure the aesthetic perception abilities of MLLMs from four perspectives, including Perception (AesP), Empathy (AesE), Assessment (AesA) and Interpretation (AesI). Extensive experimental results underscore that the current MLLMs only possess rudimentary aesthetic perception ability, and there is still a significant gap between MLLMs and humans. We hope this work can inspire the community to engage in deeper explorations on the aesthetic potentials of MLLMs. Source data will be available at https://github.com/yipoh/AesBench.

- **Summary**: Vector databases manage large collections of embedding vectors. As AI applications are growing rapidly, so are the number of embeddings that need to be stored and indexed. The Faiss library is dedicated to vector similarity search, a core functionality of vector databases. Faiss is a toolkit of indexing methods and related primitives used to search, cluster, compress and transform vectors. This paper first describes the tradeoff space of vector search, then the design principles of Faiss in terms of structure, approach to optimization and interfacing. We benchmark key features of the library and discuss a few selected applications to highlight its broad applicability.



### Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics: Combatting Label Temporal Correlation

- **Summary**: In an era where test-time adaptation methods increasingly rely on the nuanced manipulation of batch normalization (BN) parameters, one critical assumption often goes overlooked: that of independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) test batches with respect to unknown labels. This assumption culminates in biased estimates of BN statistics and jeopardizes system stability under non-i.i.d. conditions. This paper pioneers a departure from the i.i.d. paradigm by introducing a groundbreaking strategy termed "Un-Mixing Test-Time Normalization Statistics" (UnMix-TNS). UnMix-TNS re-calibrates the instance-wise statistics used to normalize each instance in a batch by mixing it with multiple unmixed statistics components, thus inherently simulating the i.i.d. environment. The key lies in our innovative online unmixing procedure, which persistently refines these statistics components by drawing upon the closest instances from an incoming test batch. Remarkably generic in its design, UnMix-TNS seamlessly integrates with an array of state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods and pre-trained architectures equipped with BN layers. Empirical evaluations corroborate the robustness of UnMix-TNS under varied scenarios ranging from single to continual and mixed domain shifts. UnMix-TNS stands out when handling test data streams with temporal correlation, including those with corrupted real-world non-i.i.d. streams, sustaining its efficacy even with minimal batch sizes and individual samples. Our results set a new standard for test-time adaptation, demonstrating significant improvements in both stability and performance across multiple benchmarks.



### Generative Denoise Distillation: Simple Stochastic Noises Induce Efficient Knowledge Transfer for Dense Prediction

- **Summary**: Knowledge distillation is the process of transferring knowledge from a more powerful large model (teacher) to a simpler counterpart (student). Numerous current approaches involve the student imitating the knowledge of the teacher directly. However, redundancy still exists in the learned representations through these prevalent methods, which tend to learn each spatial location's features indiscriminately. To derive a more compact representation (concept feature) from the teacher, inspired by human cognition, we suggest an innovative method, termed Generative Denoise Distillation (GDD), where stochastic noises are added to the concept feature of the student to embed them into the generated instance feature from a shallow network. Then, the generated instance feature is aligned with the knowledge of the instance from the teacher. We extensively experiment with object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our method. Notably, GDD achieves new state-of-the-art performance in the tasks mentioned above. We have achieved substantial improvements in semantic segmentation by enhancing PspNet and DeepLabV3, both of which are based on ResNet-18, resulting in mIoU scores of 74.67 and 77.69, respectively, surpassing their previous scores of 69.85 and 73.20 on the Cityscapes dataset of 20 categories.

- **Summary**: In recent years, few-shot action recognition has attracted increasing attention. It generally adopts the paradigm of meta-learning. In this field, overcoming the overlapping distribution of classes and outliers is still a challenging problem based on limited samples. We believe the combination of Multi-modal and Multi-view can improve this issue depending on information complementarity. Therefore, we propose a method of Multi-view Distillation based on Multi-modal Fusion. Firstly, a Probability Prompt Selector for the query is constructed to generate probability prompt embedding based on the comparison score between the prompt embeddings of the support and the visual embedding of the query. Secondly, we establish a Multi-view. In each view, we fuse the prompt embedding as consistent information with visual and the global or local temporal context to overcome the overlapping distribution of classes and outliers. Thirdly, we perform the distance fusion for the Multi-view and the mutual distillation of matching ability from one to another, enabling the model to be more robust to the distribution bias.

- **Summary**: Existing multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) methods often fail to preserve the uncertain transition region and detect small focus areas within large defocused regions accurately. To address this issue, this study proposes a new small-area-aware MFIF algorithm for enhancing object detection capability. First, we enhance the pixel attributes within the small focus and boundary regions, which are subsequently combined with visual saliency detection to obtain the pre-fusion results used to discriminate the distribution of focused pixels. To accurately ensure pixel focus, we consider the source image as a combination of focused, defocused, and uncertain regions and propose a three-region segmentation strategy. Finally, we design an effective pixel selection rule to generate segmentation decision maps and obtain the final fusion results. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately detect small and smooth focus areas while improving object detection performance, outperforming existing methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

- **Summary**: The field of AI agents is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving tasks for the image modality, which limits their ability to understand the dynamic nature of the real world, making it still far from real-life applications, e.g., guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes. Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing and perceptually intensive nature of real-world scenarios, we devise DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to handle dynamic video tasks. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video with massive content into a symbolic memory that stores \textit{task-related} attributes. This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by sub-task tools, resulting in concise and relevant intermediate results. Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover, we introduce a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT in dynamic scenes and provide in-the-wild showcases demonstrating its ability to handle more complex questions than previous studies.

- **Summary**: Recent studies indicate that Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 with Vision (GPT-4V) outperforms human physicians in medical challenge tasks. However, these evaluations primarily focused on the accuracy of multi-choice questions alone. Our study extends the current scope by conducting a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4V's rationales of image comprehension, recall of medical knowledge, and step-by-step multimodal reasoning when solving New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Image Challenges - an imaging quiz designed to test the knowledge and diagnostic capabilities of medical professionals. Evaluation results confirmed that GPT-4V outperforms human physicians regarding multi-choice accuracy (88.0% vs. 77.0%, p=0.034). GPT-4V also performs well in cases where physicians incorrectly answer, with over 80% accuracy. However, we discovered that GPT-4V frequently presents flawed rationales in cases where it makes the correct final choices (27.3%), most prominent in image comprehension (21.6%). Regardless of GPT-4V's high accuracy in multi-choice questions, our findings emphasize the necessity for further in-depth evaluations of its rationales before integrating such models into clinical workflows.

- **Summary**: Readily editable mesh blendshapes have been widely used in animation pipelines, while recent advancements in neural geometry and appearance representations have enabled high-quality inverse rendering. Building upon these observations, we introduce a novel technique that reconstructs mesh-based blendshape rigs from single or sparse multi-view videos, leveraging state-of-the-art neural inverse rendering. We begin by constructing a deformation representation that parameterizes vertex displacements into differential coordinates with tetrahedral connections, allowing for high-quality vertex deformation on high-resolution meshes. By constructing a set of semantic regulations in this representation, we achieve joint optimization of blendshapes and expression coefficients. Furthermore, to enable a user-friendly multi-view setup with unsynchronized cameras, we propose a neural regressor to model time-varying motion parameters. This approach implicitly considers the time difference across multiple cameras, enhancing the accuracy of motion modeling. Experiments demonstrate that, with the flexible input of single or sparse multi-view videos, we reconstruct personalized high-fidelity blendshapes. These blendshapes are both geometrically and semantically accurate, and they are compatible with industrial animation pipelines. Code and data will be released.

- **Summary**: Humans commonly work with multiple objects in daily life and can intuitively transfer manipulation skills to novel objects by understanding object functional regularities. However, existing technical approaches for analyzing and synthesizing hand-object manipulation are mostly limited to handling a single hand and object due to the lack of data support. To address this, we construct TACO, an extensive bimanual hand-object-interaction dataset spanning a large variety of tool-action-object compositions for daily human activities. TACO contains 2.5K motion sequences paired with third-person and egocentric views, precise hand-object 3D meshes, and action labels. To rapidly expand the data scale, we present a fully-automatic data acquisition pipeline combining multi-view sensing with an optical motion capture system. With the vast research fields provided by TACO, we benchmark three generalizable hand-object-interaction tasks: compositional action recognition, generalizable hand-object motion forecasting, and cooperative grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments reveal new insights, challenges, and opportunities for advancing the studies of generalizable hand-object motion analysis and synthesis.

- **Summary**: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors and the leading cause of cancer-related death among children. Tumor segmentation is essential in surgical and treatment planning, and response assessment and monitoring. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and has high inter-operator variability, underscoring the need for more efficient methods. We compared two deep learning-based 3D segmentation models, DeepMedic and nnU-Net, after training with pediatric-specific multi-institutional brain tumor data using based on multi-parametric MRI scans.Multi-parametric preoperative MRI scans of 339 pediatric patients (n=293 internal and n=46 external cohorts) with a variety of tumor subtypes, were preprocessed and manually segmented into four tumor subregions, i.e., enhancing tumor (ET), non-enhancing tumor (NET), cystic components (CC), and peritumoral edema (ED). After training, performance of the two models on internal and external test sets was evaluated using Dice scores, sensitivity, and Hausdorff distance with reference to ground truth manual segmentations. Dice score for nnU-Net internal test sets was (mean +/- SD (median)) 0.9+/-0.07 (0.94) for WT, 0.77+/-0.29 for ET, 0.66+/-0.32 for NET, 0.71+/-0.33 for CC, and 0.71+/-0.40 for ED, respectively. For DeepMedic the Dice scores were 0.82+/-0.16 for WT, 0.66+/-0.32 for ET, 0.48+/-0.27, for NET, 0.48+/-0.36 for CC, and 0.19+/-0.33 for ED, respectively. Dice scores were significantly higher for nnU-Net (p<=0.01). External validation of the trained nnU-Net model on the multi-institutional BraTS-PEDs 2023 dataset revealed high generalization capability in segmentation of whole tumor and tumor core with Dice scores of 0.87+/-0.13 (0.91) and 0.83+/-0.18 (0.89), respectively. Pediatric-specific data trained nnU-Net model is superior to DeepMedic for whole tumor and subregion segmentation of pediatric brain tumors.

- **Summary**: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) poses the challenge of segmenting novel categories from a distinct domain using only limited exemplars. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of CD-FSS and uncover two crucial insights: (i) the necessity of a fine-tuning stage to effectively transfer the learned meta-knowledge across domains, and (ii) the overfitting risk during the na\"ive fine-tuning due to the scarcity of novel category examples. With these insights, we propose a novel cross-domain fine-tuning strategy that addresses the challenging CD-FSS tasks. We first design Bi-directional Few-shot Prediction (BFP), which establishes support-query correspondence in a bi-directional manner, crafting augmented supervision to reduce the overfitting risk. Then we further extend BFP into Iterative Few-shot Adaptor (IFA), which is a recursive framework to capture the support-query correspondence iteratively, targeting maximal exploitation of supervisory signals from the sparse novel category samples. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts (+7.8\%), which verifies that IFA tackles the cross-domain challenges and mitigates the overfitting simultaneously. Code will be made available.

- **Summary**: Image background features can constitute background bias (spurious correlations) and impact deep classifiers decisions, causing shortcut learning (Clever Hans effect) and reducing the generalization skill on real-world data. The concept of optimizing Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) heatmaps, to improve classifier behavior, was recently introduced by a neural network architecture named ISNet. It minimizes background relevance in LRP maps, to mitigate the influence of image background features on deep classifiers decisions, hindering shortcut learning and improving generalization. For each training image, the original ISNet produces one heatmap per possible class in the classification task, hence, its training time scales linearly with the number of classes. Here, we introduce reformulated architectures that allow the training time to become independent from this number, rendering the optimization process much faster. We challenged the enhanced models utilizing the MNIST dataset with synthetic background bias, and COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, an application that is prone to shortcut learning due to background bias. The trained models minimized background attention and hindered shortcut learning, while retaining high accuracy. Considering external (out-of-distribution) test datasets, they consistently proved more accurate than multiple state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, including a dedicated image semantic segmenter followed by a classifier. The architectures presented here represent a potentially massive improvement in training speed over the original ISNet, thus introducing LRP optimization into a gamut of applications that could not be feasibly handled by the original model.

- **Summary**: Diabetic foot ulcers pose health risks, including higher morbidity, mortality, and amputation rates. Monitoring wound areas is crucial for proper care, but manual segmentation is subjective due to complex wound features and background variation. Expert annotations are costly and time-intensive, thus hampering large dataset creation. Existing segmentation models relying on extensive annotations are impractical in real-world scenarios with limited annotated data. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain augmentation method named TransMix that combines Augmented Global Pre-training AGP and Localized CutMix Fine-tuning LCF to enrich wound segmentation data for model learning. TransMix can effectively improve the foot ulcer segmentation model training by leveraging other dermatology datasets not on ulcer skins or wounds. AGP effectively increases the overall image variability, while LCF increases the diversity of wound regions. Experimental results show that TransMix increases the variability of wound regions and substantially improves the Dice score for models trained with only 40 annotated images under various proportions.

- **Summary**: Document Layout Analysis, which is the task of identifying different semantic regions inside of a document page, is a subject of great interest for both computer scientists and humanities scholars as it represents a fundamental step towards further analysis tasks for the former and a powerful tool to improve and facilitate the study of the documents for the latter. However, many of the works currently present in the literature, especially when it comes to the available datasets, fail to meet the needs of both worlds and, in particular, tend to lean towards the needs and common practices of the computer science side, leading to resources that are not representative of the humanities real needs. For this reason, the present paper introduces U-DIADS-Bib, a novel, pixel-precise, non-overlapping and noiseless document layout analysis dataset developed in close collaboration between specialists in the fields of computer vision and humanities. Furthermore, we propose a novel, computer-aided, segmentation pipeline in order to alleviate the burden represented by the time-consuming process of manual annotation, necessary for the generation of the ground truth segmentation maps. Finally, we present a standardized few-shot version of the dataset (U-DIADS-BibFS), with the aim of encouraging the development of models and solutions able to address this task with as few samples as possible, which would allow for more effective use in a real-world scenario, where collecting a large number of segmentations is not always feasible.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates how non-differentiability affects three different aspects of the neural network training process. We first analyze fully connected neural networks with ReLU activations, for which we show that the continuously differentiable neural networks converge faster than non-differentiable neural networks. Next, we analyze the problem of $L_{1}$ regularization and show that the solutions produced by deep learning solvers are incorrect and counter-intuitive even for the $L_{1}$ penalized linear model. Finally, we analyze the Edge of Stability problem, where we show that all convex, non-smooth, Lipschitz continuous functions display unstable convergence, and provide an example of a result derived using twice differentiable functions which fails in the once differentiable setting. More generally, our results suggest that accounting for the non-linearity of neural networks in the training process is essential for us to develop better algorithms, and to get a better understanding of the training process in general.

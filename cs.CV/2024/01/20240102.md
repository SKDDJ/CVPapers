- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes, objects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover, current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically, given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas. Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image, the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to improve the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the Interhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms conventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page: \url{https://github.com/XuanHuang0/VANeRF}.

- **Summary**: Detection of small, undetermined moving objects or objects in an occluded environment with a cluttered background is the main problem of computer vision. This greatly affects the detection accuracy of deep learning models. To overcome these problems, we concentrate on deep learning models for real-time detection of cars and tanks in an occluded environment with a cluttered background employing SSD and YOLO algorithms and improved precision of detection and reduce problems faced by these models. The developed method makes the custom dataset and employs a preprocessing technique to clean the noisy dataset. For training the developed model we apply the data augmentation technique to balance and diversify the data. We fine-tuned, trained, and evaluated these models on the established dataset by applying these techniques and highlighting the results we got more accurately than without applying these techniques. The accuracy and frame per second of the SSD-Mobilenet v2 model are higher than YOLO V3 and YOLO V4. Furthermore, by employing various techniques like data enhancement, noise reduction, parameter optimization, and model fusion we improve the effectiveness of detection and recognition. We further added a counting algorithm, and target attributes experimental comparison, and made a graphical user interface system for the developed model with features of object counting, alerts, status, resolution, and frame per second. Subsequently, to justify the importance of the developed method analysis of YOLO V3, V4, and SSD were incorporated. Which resulted in the overall completion of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: The rise of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in language-based driving tasks. However, existing research typically focuses on limited tasks and often omits key multi-view and temporal information which is crucial for robust autonomous driving. To bridge these gaps, we introduce NuInstruct, a novel dataset with 91K multi-view video-QA pairs across 17 subtasks, where each task demands holistic information (e.g., temporal, multi-view, and spatial), significantly elevating the challenge level. To obtain NuInstruct, we propose a novel SQL-based method to generate instruction-response pairs automatically, which is inspired by the driving logical progression of humans. We further present BEV-InMLLM, an end-to-end method for efficiently deriving instruction-aware Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, language-aligned for large language models. BEV-InMLLM integrates multi-view, spatial awareness, and temporal semantics to enhance MLLMs' capabilities on NuInstruct tasks. Moreover, our proposed BEV injection module is a plug-and-play method for existing MLLMs. Our experiments on NuInstruct demonstrate that BEV-InMLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, e.g. around 9% improvement on various tasks. We plan to release our NuInstruct for future research development.

- **Summary**: Since distribution shifts are likely to occur after a model's deployment and can drastically decrease the model's performance, online test-time adaptation (TTA) continues to update the model during test-time, leveraging the current test data. In real-world scenarios, test data streams are not always independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Instead, they are frequently temporally correlated, making them non-i.i.d. Many existing methods struggle to cope with this scenario. In response, we propose a diversity-aware and category-balanced buffer that can simulate an i.i.d. data stream, even in non-i.i.d. scenarios. Combined with a diversity and entropy-weighted entropy loss, we show that a stable adaptation is possible on a wide range of corruptions and natural domain shifts, based on ImageNet. We achieve state-of-the-art results on most considered benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) with incremental training is crucial in industrial manufacturing, as unpredictable defects make obtaining sufficient labeled data infeasible. However, continual learning methods primarily rely on supervised annotations, while the application in UAD is limited due to the absence of supervision. Current UAD methods train separate models for different classes sequentially, leading to catastrophic forgetting and a heavy computational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Detection framework called UCAD, which equips the UAD with continual learning capability through contrastively-learned prompts. In the proposed UCAD, we design a Continual Prompting Module (CPM) by utilizing a concise key-prompt-knowledge memory bank to guide task-invariant `anomaly' model predictions using task-specific `normal' knowledge. Moreover, Structure-based Contrastive Learning (SCL) is designed with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve prompt learning and anomaly segmentation results. Specifically, by treating SAM's masks as structure, we draw features within the same mask closer and push others apart for general feature representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and set the benchmark on unsupervised continual anomaly detection and segmentation, demonstrating that our method is significantly better than anomaly detection methods, even with rehearsal training. The code will be available at https://github.com/shirowalker/UCAD.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation models trained on annotated data fail to generalize well when the input data distribution changes over extended time period, leading to requiring re-training to maintain performance. Classic Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to address a similar problem when there is target domain with no annotated data points through transferring knowledge from a source domain with annotated data. We develop an online UDA algorithm for semantic segmentation of images that improves model generalization on unannotated domains in scenarios where source data access is restricted during adaptation. We perform model adaptation is by minimizing the distributional distance between the source latent features and the target features in a shared embedding space. Our solution promotes a shared domain-agnostic latent feature space between the two domains, which allows for classifier generalization on the target dataset. To alleviate the need of access to source samples during adaptation, we approximate the source latent feature distribution via an appropriate surrogate distribution, in this case a Gassian mixture model (GMM). We evaluate our approach on well established semantic segmentation datasets and demonstrate it compares favorably against state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA semantic segmentation methods.

- **Summary**: Event-based cameras provide accurate and high temporal resolution measurements for performing computer vision tasks in challenging scenarios, such as high-dynamic range environments and fast-motion maneuvers. Despite their advantages, utilizing deep learning for event-based vision encounters a significant obstacle due to the scarcity of annotated data caused by the relatively recent emergence of event-based cameras. To overcome this limitation, leveraging the knowledge available from annotated data obtained with conventional frame-based cameras presents an effective solution based on unsupervised domain adaptation. We propose a new algorithm tailored for adapting a deep neural network trained on annotated frame-based data to generalize well on event-based unannotated data. Our approach incorporates uncorrelated conditioning and self-supervised learning in an adversarial learning scheme to close the gap between the two source and target domains. By applying self-supervised learning, the algorithm learns to align the representations of event-based data with those from frame-based camera data, thereby facilitating knowledge transfer.Furthermore, the inclusion of uncorrelated conditioning ensures that the adapted model effectively distinguishes between event-based and conventional data, enhancing its ability to classify event-based images accurately.Through empirical experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses existing approaches designed for the same purpose using two benchmarks. The superior performance of our solution is attributed to its ability to effectively utilize annotated data from frame-based cameras and transfer the acquired knowledge to the event-based vision domain.

- **Summary**: The demand for the retrieval of complex scene data in autonomous driving is increasing, especially as passenger vehicles have been equipped with the ability to navigate urban settings, with the imperative to address long-tail scenarios. Meanwhile, under the pre-existing two dimensional image retrieval method, some problems may arise with scene retrieval, such as lack of global feature representation and subpar text retrieval ability. To address these issues, we have proposed \textbf{BEV-CLIP}, the first multimodal Bird's-Eye View(BEV) retrieval methodology that utilizes descriptive text as an input to retrieve corresponding scenes. This methodology applies the semantic feature extraction abilities of a large language model (LLM) to facilitate zero-shot retrieval of extensive text descriptions, and incorporates semi-structured information from a knowledge graph to improve the semantic richness and variety of the language embedding. Our experiments result in 87.66% accuracy on NuScenes dataset in text-to-BEV feature retrieval. The demonstrated cases in our paper support that our retrieval method is also indicated to be effective in identifying certain long-tail corner scenes.

- **Summary**: Due to the poor illumination and the difficulty in annotating, nighttime conditions pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicle perception systems. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely applied to semantic segmentation on such images to adapt models from normal conditions to target nighttime-condition domains. Self-training (ST) is a paradigm in UDA, where a momentum teacher is utilized for pseudo-label prediction, but a confirmation bias issue exists. Because the one-directional knowledge transfer from a single teacher is insufficient to adapt to a large domain shift. To mitigate this issue, we propose to alleviate domain gap by incrementally considering style influence and illumination change. Therefore, we introduce a one-stage Dual-Teacher Bi-directional Self-training (DTBS) framework for smooth knowledge transfer and feedback. Based on two teacher models, we present a novel pipeline to respectively decouple style and illumination shift. In addition, we propose a new Re-weight exponential moving average (EMA) to merge the knowledge of style and illumination factors, and provide feedback to the student model. In this way, our method can be embedded in other UDA methods to enhance their performance. For example, the Cityscapes to ACDC night task yielded 53.8 mIoU (\%), which corresponds to an improvement of +5\% over the previous state-of-the-art.

- **Summary**: Medical data collected for making a diagnostic decision are typically multi-modal and provide complementary perspectives of a subject. A computer-aided diagnosis system welcomes multi-modal inputs; however, how to effectively fuse such multi-modal data is a challenging task and attracts a lot of attention in the medical research field. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based framework, called Alifuse, for aligning and fusing multi-modal medical data. Specifically, we convert images and unstructured and structured texts into vision and language tokens, and use intramodal and intermodal attention mechanisms to learn holistic representations of all imaging and non-imaging data for classification. We apply Alifuse to classify Alzheimer's disease and obtain state-of-the-art performance on five public datasets, by outperforming eight baselines. The source code will be available online later.

- **Summary**: Monocular 3D object detection poses a significant challenge due to the lack of depth information in RGB images. Many existing methods strive to enhance the object depth estimation performance by allocating additional parameters for object depth estimation, utilizing extra modules or data. In contrast, we introduce a novel metric learning scheme that encourages the model to extract depth-discriminative features regardless of the visual attributes without increasing inference time and model size. Our method employs the distance-preserving function to organize the feature space manifold in relation to ground-truth object depth. The proposed (K, B, eps)-quasi-isometric loss leverages predetermined pairwise distance restriction as guidance for adjusting the distance among object descriptors without disrupting the non-linearity of the natural feature manifold. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary head for object-wise depth estimation, which enhances depth quality while maintaining the inference time. The broad applicability of our method is demonstrated through experiments that show improvements in overall performance when integrated into various baselines. The results show that our method consistently improves the performance of various baselines by 23.51% and 5.78% on average across KITTI and Waymo, respectively.



### Exploring Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection with Human Vision: A Small Target Aware Detector

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to localize pixel points whose spectral features differ from the background. HAD is essential in scenarios of unknown or camouflaged target features, such as water quality monitoring, crop growth monitoring and camouflaged target detection, where prior information of targets is difficult to obtain. Existing HAD methods aim to objectively detect and distinguish background and anomalous spectra, which can be achieved almost effortlessly by human perception. However, the underlying processes of human visual perception are thought to be quite complex. In this paper, we analyze hyperspectral image (HSI) features under human visual perception, and transfer the solution process of HAD to the more robust feature space for the first time. Specifically, we propose a small target aware detector (STAD), which introduces saliency maps to capture HSI features closer to human visual perception. STAD not only extracts more anomalous representations, but also reduces the impact of low-confidence regions through a proposed small target filter (STF). Furthermore, considering the possibility of HAD algorithms being applied to edge devices, we propose a full connected network to convolutional network knowledge distillation strategy. It can learn the spectral and spatial features of the HSI while lightening the network. We train the network on the HAD100 training set and validate the proposed method on the HAD100 test set. Our method provides a new solution space for HAD that is closer to human visual perception with high confidence. Sufficient experiments on real HSI with multiple method comparisons demonstrate the excellent performance and unique potential of the proposed method.

- **Summary**: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has achieved near-atomic level resolution of biomolecules by reconstructing 2D micrographs. However, the resolution and accuracy of the reconstructed particles are significantly reduced due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and complex noise structure of cryo-EM images. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion model with post-processing framework to effectively denoise and restore single particle cryo-EM images. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising methods by effectively removing structural noise that has not been addressed before. Additionally, more accurate and high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction structures can be obtained from denoised cryo-EM images.

- **Summary**: Face recognition systems have raised concerns due to their vulnerability to different presentation attacks, and system security has become an increasingly critical concern. Although many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods perform well in intra-dataset scenarios, their generalization remains a challenge. To address this issue, some methods adopt domain adversarial training (DAT) to extract domain-invariant features. However, the competition between the encoder and the domain discriminator can cause the network to be difficult to train and converge. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial attack (DAA) method to mitigate the training instability problem by adding perturbations to the input images, which makes them indistinguishable across domains and enables domain alignment. Moreover, since models trained on limited data and types of attacks cannot generalize well to unknown attacks, we propose a dual perceptual and generative knowledge distillation framework for face anti-spoofing that utilizes pre-trained face-related models containing rich face priors. Specifically, we adopt two different face-related models as teachers to transfer knowledge to the target student model. The pre-trained teacher models are not from the task of face anti-spoofing but from perceptual and generative tasks, respectively, which implicitly augment the data. By combining both DAA and dual-teacher knowledge distillation, we develop a dual teacher knowledge distillation with domain alignment framework (DTDA) for face anti-spoofing. The advantage of our proposed method has been verified through extensive ablation studies and comparison with state-of-the-art methods on public datasets across multiple protocols.

- **Summary**: Urban transformations have profound societal impact on both individuals and communities at large. Accurately assessing these shifts is essential for understanding their underlying causes and ensuring sustainable urban planning. Traditional measurements often encounter constraints in spatial and temporal granularity, failing to capture real-time physical changes. While street view imagery, capturing the heartbeat of urban spaces from a pedestrian point of view, can add as a high-definition, up-to-date, and on-the-ground visual proxy of urban change. We curate the largest street view time series dataset to date, and propose an end-to-end change detection model to effectively capture physical alterations in the built environment at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by benchmark comparisons with previous literature and implementing it at the city-wide level. Our approach has the potential to supplement existing dataset and serve as a fine-grained and accurate assessment of urban change.

- **Summary**: With the rapid evolution of the Text-to-Image (T2I) model in recent years, their unsatisfactory generation result has become a challenge. However, uniformly refining AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) of different qualities not only limited optimization capabilities for low-quality AIGIs but also brought negative optimization to high-quality AIGIs. To address this issue, a quality-award refiner named Q-Refine is proposed. Based on the preference of the Human Visual System (HVS), Q-Refine uses the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metric to guide the refining process for the first time, and modify images of different qualities through three adaptive pipelines. Experimental shows that for mainstream T2I models, Q-Refine can perform effective optimization to AIGIs of different qualities. It can be a general refiner to optimize AIGIs from both fidelity and aesthetic quality levels, thus expanding the application of the T2I generation models.

- **Summary**: Recently, text-to-image (T2I) synthesis has undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) and their enhancement in Large Vision Models (LVM), greatly enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of traditional T2I models. Nevertheless, previous methods focus on improving generation quality but introduce unsafe factors into prompts. We explore that appending specific camera descriptions to prompts can enhance safety performance. Consequently, we propose a simple and safe prompt engineering method (SSP) to improve image generation quality by providing optimal camera descriptions. Specifically, we create a dataset from multi-datasets as original prompts. To select the optimal camera, we design an optimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original prompts capable of automatically matching. Appending camera descriptions to original prompts generates optimized prompts for further LVM image generation. Experiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of 16% compared to others and safety metrics by 48.9%.

While previous works have explored image generation conditioned on scene graphs or layouts, our task is distinctive and important as it involves generating scene graphs themselves unconditionally from noise, enabling efficient and interpretable control for image generation. Our task is challenging, requiring the generation of plausible scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), including continuous object bounding boxes and discrete object and relation categories. We introduce a novel diffusion model, DiffuseSG, that jointly models the adjacency matrix along with heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore various types of encodings for the categorical data, relaxing it into a continuous space. With a graph transformer being the denoiser, DiffuseSG successively denoises the scene graph representation in a continuous space and discretizes the final representation to generate the clean scene graph. Additionally, we introduce an IoU regularization to enhance the empirical performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods in scene graph generation on the Visual Genome and COCO-Stuff datasets, both on standard and newly introduced metrics that better capture the problem complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate the additional benefits of our model in two downstream applications: 1) excelling in a series of scene graph completion tasks, and 2) improving scene graph detection models by using extra training samples generated from DiffuseSG.

- **Summary**: We describe a new general method for segmentation in MRI scans using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), offering several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. It works in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Although convoking classical ideas of TDA, such an algorithm has never been proposed separately from deep learning methods. To achieve this, our approach takes into account, in addition to the homology of the image, the localization of representative cycles, a piece of information that seems never to have been exploited in this context. In particular, it offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated data sets. TDA also provides a more interpretable and stable framework for segmentation by explicitly mapping topological features to segmentation components. By adapting the geometric object to be detected, the algorithm can be adjusted to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We carefully study the examples of glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected, as well as myocardium in cardiac MRI, involving a cylinder, and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles. We compare our method to state-of-the-art algorithms.

- **Summary**: Video content has experienced a surge in popularity, asserting its dominance over internet traffic and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Video compression has long been regarded as the primary means of efficiently managing the substantial multimedia traffic generated by video-capturing devices. Nevertheless, video compression algorithms entail significant computational demands in order to achieve substantial compression ratios. This complexity presents a formidable challenge when implementing efficient video coding standards in resource-constrained embedded systems, such as IoT edge node cameras. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces NU-Class Net, an innovative deep-learning model designed to mitigate compression artifacts stemming from lossy compression codecs. This enhancement significantly elevates the perceptible quality of low-bit-rate videos. By employing the NU-Class Net, the video encoder within the video-capturing node can reduce output quality, thereby generating low-bit-rate videos and effectively curtailing both computation and bandwidth requirements at the edge. On the decoder side, which is typically less encumbered by resource limitations, NU-Class Net is applied after the video decoder to compensate for artifacts and approximate the quality of the original video. Experimental results affirm the efficacy of the proposed model in enhancing the perceptible quality of videos, especially those streamed at low bit rates.

- **Summary**: Multi-class colorectal tissue classification is a challenging problem that is typically addressed in a setting, where it is assumed that ample amounts of training data is available. However, manual annotation of fine-grained colorectal tissue samples of multiple classes, especially the rare ones like stromal tumor and anal cancer is laborious and expensive. To address this, we propose a knowledge distillation-based approach, named KD-CTCNet, that effectively captures local texture information from few tissue samples, through a distillation loss, to improve the standard CNN features. The resulting enriched feature representation achieves improved classification performance specifically in low data regimes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets of colorectal tissues reveal the merits of the proposed contributions, with a consistent gain achieved over different approaches across low data settings. The code and models are publicly available on GitHub.

- **Summary**: We present En3D, an enhanced generative scheme for sculpting high-quality 3D human avatars. Unlike previous works that rely on scarce 3D datasets or limited 2D collections with imbalanced viewing angles and imprecise pose priors, our approach aims to develop a zero-shot 3D generative scheme capable of producing visually realistic, geometrically accurate and content-wise diverse 3D humans without relying on pre-existing 3D or 2D assets. To address this challenge, we introduce a meticulously crafted workflow that implements accurate physical modeling to learn the enhanced 3D generative model from synthetic 2D data. During inference, we integrate optimization modules to bridge the gap between realistic appearances and coarse 3D shapes. Specifically, En3D comprises three modules: a 3D generator that accurately models generalizable 3D humans with realistic appearance from synthesized balanced, diverse, and structured human images; a geometry sculptor that enhances shape quality using multi-view normal constraints for intricate human anatomy; and a texturing module that disentangles explicit texture maps with fidelity and editability, leveraging semantical UV partitioning and a differentiable rasterizer. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms prior works in terms of image quality, geometry accuracy and content diversity. We also showcase the applicability of our generated avatars for animation and editing, as well as the scalability of our approach for content-style free adaptation.

- **Summary**: Simulating high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in complex scenes has consistently presented a significant research challenge. The development of a microwave-domain surface scattering model and its reversibility are poised to play a pivotal role in enhancing the authenticity of SAR image simulations and facilitating the reconstruction of target parameters. Drawing inspiration from the field of computer graphics, this paper proposes a surface microwave rendering model that comprehensively considers both Specular and Diffuse contributions. The model is analytically represented by the coherent spatially varying bidirectional scattering distribution function (CSVBSDF) based on the Kirchhoff approximation (KA) and the perturbation method (SPM). And SAR imaging is achieved through the synergistic combination of ray tracing and fast mapping projection techniques. Furthermore, a differentiable ray tracing (DRT) engine based on SAR images was constructed for CSVBSDF surface scattering parameter learning. Within this SAR image simulation engine, the use of differentiable reverse ray tracing enables the rapid estimation of parameter gradients from SAR images. The effectiveness of this approach has been validated through simulations and comparisons with real SAR images. By learning the surface scattering parameters, substantial enhancements in SAR image simulation performance under various observation conditions have been demonstrated.

- **Summary**: Semantic segmentation techniques for extracting building footprints from high-resolution remote sensing images have been widely used in many fields such as urban planning. However, large-scale building extraction demands higher diversity in training samples. In this paper, we construct a Global Building Semantic Segmentation (GBSS) dataset (The dataset will be released), which comprises 116.9k pairs of samples (about 742k buildings) from six continents. There are significant variations of building samples in terms of size and style, so the dataset can be a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the generalization and robustness of building semantic segmentation models. We validated through quantitative and qualitative comparisons between different datasets, and further confirmed the potential application in the field of transfer learning by conducting experiments on subsets.

- **Summary**: Modern healthcare often utilises radiographic images alongside textual reports for diagnostics, encouraging the use of Vision-Language Self-Supervised Learning (VL-SSL) with large pre-trained models to learn versatile medical vision representations. However, most existing VL-SSL frameworks are trained end-to-end, which is computation-heavy and can lose vital prior information embedded in pre-trained encoders. To address both issues, we introduce the backbone-agnostic Adaptor framework, which preserves medical knowledge in pre-trained image and text encoders by keeping them frozen, and employs a lightweight Adaptor module for cross-modal learning. Experiments on medical image classification and segmentation tasks across three datasets reveal that our framework delivers competitive performance while cutting trainable parameters by over 90% compared to current pre-training approaches. Notably, when fine-tuned with just 1% of data, Adaptor outperforms several Transformer-based methods trained on full datasets in medical image segmentation.

- **Summary**: Deforestation, a major contributor to climate change, poses detrimental consequences such as agricultural sector disruption, global warming, flash floods, and landslides. Conventional approaches to urban street tree inventory suffer from inaccuracies and necessitate specialised equipment. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method that leverages deep learning techniques and mobile phone imaging for urban street tree inventory. Our approach utilises a pair of images captured by smartphone cameras to accurately segment tree trunks and compute the diameter at breast height (DBH). Compared to traditional methods, our approach exhibits several advantages, including superior accuracy, reduced dependency on specialised equipment, and applicability in hard-to-reach areas. We evaluated our method on a comprehensive dataset of 400 trees and achieved a DBH estimation accuracy with an error rate of less than 2.5%. Our method holds significant potential for substantially improving forest management practices. By enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of tree inventory, our model empowers urban management to mitigate the adverse effects of deforestation and climate change.

- **Summary**: Identifying labels that did not appear during training, known as multi-label zero-shot learning, is a non-trivial task in computer vision. To this end, recent studies have attempted to explore the multi-modal knowledge of vision-language pre-training (VLP) models by knowledge distillation, allowing to recognize unseen labels in an open-vocabulary manner. However, experimental evidence shows that knowledge distillation is suboptimal and provides limited performance gain in unseen label prediction. In this paper, a novel query-based knowledge sharing paradigm is proposed to explore the multi-modal knowledge from the pretrained VLP model for open-vocabulary multi-label classification. Specifically, a set of learnable label-agnostic query tokens is trained to extract critical vision knowledge from the input image, and further shared across all labels, allowing them to select tokens of interest as visual clues for recognition. Besides, we propose an effective prompt pool for robust label embedding, and reformulate the standard ranking learning into a form of classification to allow the magnitude of feature vectors for matching, which both significantly benefit label recognition. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot task by 5.9% and 4.5% in mAP on the NUS-WIDE and Open Images, respectively.

- **Summary**: Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, we propose a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack that resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced MAhalanobis distance (JMA) term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to a linearized version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. \cite{szegedy2013intriguing}. The experiments we carried out confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, the JMA attack is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in a complex multilabel classification scenario with 20 labels, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, the JMA attack usually requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.

- **Summary**: Skin lesions are classified in benign or malignant. Among the malignant, melanoma is a very aggressive cancer and the major cause of deaths. So, early diagnosis of skin cancer is very desired. In the last few years, there is a growing interest in computer aided diagnostic (CAD) using most image and clinical data of the lesion. These sources of information present limitations due to their inability to provide information of the molecular structure of the lesion. NIR spectroscopy may provide an alternative source of information to automated CAD of skin lesions. The most commonly used techniques and classification algorithms used in spectroscopy are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Nonetheless, there is a growing interest in applying the modern techniques of machine and deep learning (MDL) to spectroscopy. One of the main limitations to apply MDL to spectroscopy is the lack of public datasets. Since there is no public dataset of NIR spectral data to skin lesions, as far as we know, an effort has been made and a new dataset named NIR-SC-UFES, has been collected, annotated and analyzed generating the gold-standard for classification of NIR spectral data to skin cancer. Next, the machine learning algorithms XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, 1D-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) were investigated to classify cancer and non-cancer skin lesions. Experimental results indicate the best performance obtained by LightGBM with pre-processing using standard normal variate (SNV), feature extraction providing values of 0.839 for balanced accuracy, 0.851 for recall, 0.852 for precision, and 0.850 for F-score. The obtained results indicate the first steps in CAD of skin lesions aiming the automated triage of patients with skin lesions in vivo using NIR spectral data.

- **Summary**: The current approach to fetal anomaly screening is based on biometric measurements derived from individually selected ultrasound images. In this paper, we introduce a paradigm shift that attains human-level performance in biometric measurement by aggregating automatically extracted biometrics from every frame across an entire scan, with no need for operator intervention. We use a convolutional neural network to classify each frame of an ultrasound video recording. We then measure fetal biometrics in every frame where appropriate anatomy is visible. We use a Bayesian method to estimate the true value of each biometric from a large number of measurements and probabilistically reject outliers. We performed a retrospective experiment on 1457 recordings (comprising 48 million frames) of 20-week ultrasound scans, estimated fetal biometrics in those scans and compared our estimates to the measurements sonographers took during the scan. Our method achieves human-level performance in estimating fetal biometrics and estimates well-calibrated credible intervals in which the true biometric value is expected to lie.

- **Summary**: In human-centric content generation, the pre-trained text-to-image models struggle to produce user-wanted portrait images, which retain the identity of individuals while exhibiting diverse expressions. This paper introduces our efforts towards personalized face generation. To this end, we propose a novel multi-modal face generation framework, capable of simultaneous identity-expression control and more fine-grained expression synthesis. Our expression control is so sophisticated that it can be specialized by the fine-grained emotional vocabulary. We devise a novel diffusion model that can undertake the task of simultaneously face swapping and reenactment. Due to the entanglement of identity and expression, it's nontrivial to separately and precisely control them in one framework, thus has not been explored yet. To overcome this, we propose several innovative designs in the conditional diffusion model, including balancing identity and expression encoder, improved midpoint sampling, and explicitly background conditioning. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the controllability and scalability of the proposed framework, in comparison with state-of-the-art text-to-image, face swapping, and face reenactment methods.

- **Summary**: Crowd counting has gained significant popularity due to its practical applications. However, mainstream counting methods ignore precise individual localization and suffer from annotation noise because of counting from estimating density maps. Additionally, they also struggle with high-density images.To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end model called Fine-Grained Extraction Network (FGENet). Different from methods estimating density maps, FGENet directly learns the original coordinate points that represent the precise localization of individuals.This study designs a fusion module, named Fine-Grained Feature Pyramid(FGFP), that is used to fuse feature maps extracted by the backbone of FGENet. The fused features are then passed to both regression and classification heads, where the former provides predicted point coordinates for a given image, and the latter determines the confidence level for each predicted point being an individual. At the end, FGENet establishes correspondences between prediction points and ground truth points by employing the Hungarian algorithm. For training FGENet, we design a robust loss function, named Three-Task Combination (TTC), to mitigate the impact of annotation noise. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used crowd counting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FGENet. Notably, our method achieves a remarkable improvement of 3.14 points in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the ShanghaiTech Part A dataset, showcasing its superiority over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Even more impressively, FGENet surpasses previous benchmarks on the UCF\_CC\_50 dataset with an astounding enhancement of 30.16 points in MAE.

- **Summary**: Traditional manual detection for solder joint defect is no longer applied during industrial production due to low efficiency, inconsistent evaluation, high cost and lack of real-time data. A new approach has been proposed to address the issues of low accuracy, high false detection rates and computational cost of solder joint defect detection in surface mount technology of industrial scenarios. The proposed solution is a hybrid attention mechanism designed specifically for the solder joint defect detection algorithm to improve quality control in the manufacturing process by increasing the accuracy while reducing the computational cost. The hybrid attention mechanism comprises a proposed enhanced multi-head self-attention and coordinate attention mechanisms increase the ability of attention networks to perceive contextual information and enhances the utilization range of network features. The coordinate attention mechanism enhances the connection between different channels and reduces location information loss. The hybrid attention mechanism enhances the capability of the network to perceive long-distance position information and learn local features. The improved algorithm model has good detection ability for solder joint defect detection, with mAP reaching 91.5%, 4.3% higher than the You Only Look Once version 5 algorithm and better than other comparative algorithms. Compared to other versions, mean Average Precision, Precision, Recall, and Frame per Seconds indicators have also improved. The improvement of detection accuracy can be achieved while meeting real-time detection requirements.

- **Summary**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have been proposed as an innovative 3D representation method. While attracting lots of attention, NeRF faces critical issues such as information confidentiality and security. Steganography is a technique used to embed information in another object as a means of protecting information security. Currently, there are few related studies on NeRF steganography, facing challenges in low steganography quality, model weight damage, and a limited amount of steganographic information. This paper proposes a novel NeRF steganography method based on trainable noise: Noise-NeRF. Furthermore, we propose the Adaptive Pixel Selection strategy and Pixel Perturbation strategy to improve the steganography quality and efficiency. The extensive experiments on open-source datasets show that Noise-NeRF provides state-of-the-art performances in both steganography quality and rendering quality, as well as effectiveness in super-resolution image steganography.

- **Summary**: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a framework, where multiple related tasks are learned jointly and benefit from a shared representation space, or parameter transfer. To provide sufficient learning support, modern MTL uses annotated data with full, or sufficiently large overlap across tasks, i.e., each input sample is annotated for all, or most of the tasks. However, collecting such annotations is prohibitive in many real applications, and cannot benefit from datasets available for individual tasks. In this work, we challenge this setup and show that MTL can be successful with classification tasks with little, or non-overlapping annotations, or when there is big discrepancy in the size of labeled data per task. We explore task-relatedness for co-annotation and co-training, and propose a novel approach, where knowledge exchange is enabled between the tasks via distribution matching. To demonstrate the general applicability of our method, we conducted diverse case studies in the domains of affective computing, face recognition, species recognition, and shopping item classification using nine datasets. Our large-scale study of affective tasks for basic expression recognition and facial action unit detection illustrates that our approach is network agnostic and brings large performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art in both tasks and across all studied databases. In all case studies, we show that co-training via task-relatedness is advantageous and prevents negative transfer (which occurs when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model).

- **Summary**: The development of facial biometric systems has contributed greatly to the development of the computer vision field. Nowadays, there's always a need to develop a multimodal system that combines multiple biometric traits in an efficient, meaningful way. In this paper, we introduce "IdentiFace" which is a multimodal facial biometric system that combines the core of facial recognition with some of the most important soft biometric traits such as gender, face shape, and emotion. We also focused on developing the system using only VGG-16 inspired architecture with minor changes across different subsystems. This unification allows for simpler integration across modalities. It makes it easier to interpret the learned features between the tasks which gives a good indication about the decision-making process across the facial modalities and potential connection. For the recognition problem, we acquired a 99.2% test accuracy for five classes with high intra-class variations using data collected from the FERET database[1]. We achieved 99.4% on our dataset and 95.15% on the public dataset[2] in the gender recognition problem. We were also able to achieve a testing accuracy of 88.03% in the face-shape problem using the celebrity face-shape dataset[3]. Finally, we achieved a decent testing accuracy of 66.13% in the emotion task which is considered a very acceptable accuracy compared to related work on the FER2013 dataset[4].

- **Summary**: RGBT tracking has been widely used in various fields such as robotics, surveillance processing, and autonomous driving. Existing RGBT trackers fully explore the spatial information between the template and the search region and locate the target based on the appearance matching results. However, these RGBT trackers have very limited exploitation of temporal information, either ignoring temporal information or exploiting it through online sampling and training. The former struggles to cope with the object state changes, while the latter neglects the correlation between spatial and temporal information. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Adaptive RGBT Tracking framework, named as TATrack. TATrack has a spatio-temporal two-stream structure and captures temporal information by an online updated template, where the two-stream structure refers to the multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal interaction for the initial template and the online update template respectively. TATrack contributes to comprehensively exploit spatio-temporal information and multi-modal information for target localization. In addition, we design a spatio-temporal interaction (STI) mechanism that bridges two branches and enables cross-modal interaction to span longer time scales. Extensive experiments on three popular RGBT tracking benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at real-time speed.

- **Summary**: The early identification of diseases in cocoa pods is an important task to guarantee the production of high-quality cocoa. The use of artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, computer vision and deep learning are promising solutions to help identify and classify diseases in cocoa pods. In this paper we introduce the development and evaluation of a deep learning computational model applied to the identification of diseases in cocoa pods, focusing on "monilia" and "black pod" diseases. An exhaustive review of state-of-the-art of computational models was carried out, based on scientific articles related to the identification of plant diseases using computer vision and deep learning techniques. As a result of the search, EfficientDet-Lite4, an efficient and lightweight model for object detection, was selected. A dataset, including images of both healthy and diseased cocoa pods, has been utilized to train the model to detect and pinpoint disease manifestations with considerable accuracy. Significant enhancements in the model training and evaluation demonstrate the capability of recognizing and classifying diseases through image analysis. Furthermore, the functionalities of the model were integrated into an Android native mobile with an user-friendly interface, allowing to younger or inexperienced farmers a fast and accuracy identification of health status of cocoa pods

- **Summary**: The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have significantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for the given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with only one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate multi-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely manage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance of key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely VideoDrafter, for content-consistent multi-scene video generation. Technically, VideoDrafter leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to convert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits from the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a prompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as camera movement. VideoDrafter identifies the common entities throughout the script and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is then fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each entity. Finally, VideoDrafter outputs a multi-scene video by generating each scene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the descriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion model incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to strengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoDrafter outperforms the SOTA video generation models in terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference.

- **Summary**: Vector quantization-based image semantic communication systems have successfully boosted transmission efficiency, but face a challenge with conflicting requirements between codebook design and digital constellation modulation. Traditional codebooks need a wide index range, while modulation favors few discrete states. To address this, we propose a multilevel generative semantic communication system with a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, we train a high-quality codebook, using a multi-head octonary codebook (MOC) to compress the index range. We also integrate a residual vector quantization (RVQ) mechanism for effective multilevel communication. In the second stage, a noise reduction block (NRB) based on Swin Transformer is introduced, coupled with the multilevel codebook from the first stage, serving as a high-quality semantic knowledge base (SKB) for generative feature restoration. Experimental results highlight MOC-RVQ's superior performance over methods like BPG or JPEG, even without channel error correction coding.

- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication. However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can provide a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.

- **Summary**: Manual delineation of tumor regions from magnetic resonance (MR) images is time-consuming, requires an expert, and is prone to human error. In recent years, deep learning models have been the go-to approach for the segmentation of brain tumors. U-Net and its' variants for semantic segmentation of medical images have achieved good results in the literature. However, U-Net and its' variants tend to over-segment tumor regions and may not accurately segment the tumor edges. The edges of the tumor are as important as the tumor regions for accurate diagnosis, surgical precision, and treatment planning. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract edges from the ground truth using a derivative-like filter followed by edge reconstruction to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the brain tumor ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the author studies several U-Net and its' variant architectures with and without tumor edges ground truth as a target along with the tumor ground truth for brain tumor segmentation. The author used the BraTS2020 benchmark dataset to perform the study and the results are tabulated for the dice and Hausdorff95 metrics. The mean and median metrics are calculated for the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) regions. Compared to the baseline U-Net and its variants, the models that learned edges along with the tumor regions performed well in core tumor regions in both training and validation datasets. The improved performance of edge-trained models trained on baseline models like U-Net and V-Net achieved performance similar to baseline state-of-the-art models like Swin U-Net and hybrid MR-U-Net. The edge-target trained models are capable of generating edge maps that can be useful for treatment planning. Additionally, for further explainability of the results, the activation map generated by the hybrid MR-U-Net has been studied.

- **Summary**: This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban street scenes from monocular videos. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed, coupled with the critical need for high precision in tracked vehicle poses. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles all these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a dynamic spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 133 FPS (1066$\times$1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. Furthermore, the proposed representation delivers performance on par with that achieved using precise ground-truth poses, despite relying only on poses from an off-the-shelf tracker.

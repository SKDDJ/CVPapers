- **Summary**: The goal of selective prediction is to allow an a model to abstain when it may not be able to deliver a reliable prediction, which is important in safety-critical contexts. Existing approaches to selective prediction typically require access to the internals of a model, require retraining a model or study only unimodal models. However, the most powerful models (e.g. GPT-4) are typically only available as black boxes with inaccessible internals, are not retrainable by end-users, and are frequently used for multimodal tasks. We study the possibility of selective prediction for vision-language models in a realistic, black-box setting. We propose using the principle of \textit{neighborhood consistency} to identify unreliable responses from a black-box vision-language model in question answering tasks. We hypothesize that given only a visual question and model response, the consistency of the model's responses over the neighborhood of a visual question will indicate reliability. It is impossible to directly sample neighbors in feature space in a black-box setting. Instead, we show that it is possible to use a smaller proxy model to approximately sample from the neighborhood. We find that neighborhood consistency can be used to identify model responses to visual questions that are likely unreliable, even in adversarial settings or settings that are out-of-distribution to the proxy model.

- **Summary**: In recent years, skeleton-based action recognition, leveraging multimodal Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), has achieved remarkable results. However, due to their deep structure and reliance on continuous floating-point operations, GCN-based methods are energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an innovative Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation (MK-SGN). By merging the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with the graph representation capability of GCN, the proposed MK-SGN reduces energy consumption while maintaining recognition accuracy. Firstly, we convert GCN into Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (SGN) and construct a foundational Base-SGN for skeleton-based action recognition, establishing a new benchmark and paving the way for future research exploration. Secondly, we further propose a Spiking Multimodal Fusion module (SMF), leveraging mutual information to process multimodal data more efficiently. Additionally, we introduce a spiking attention mechanism and design a Spatio Graph Convolution module with a Spatial Global Spiking Attention mechanism (SA-SGC), enhancing feature learning capability. Furthermore, we delve into knowledge distillation methods from multimodal GCN to SGN and propose a novel, integrated method that simultaneously focuses on both intermediate layer distillation and soft label distillation to improve the performance of SGN. On two challenging datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, MK-SGN outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-like frameworks in reducing computational load and energy consumption. In contrast, typical GCN methods typically consume more than 35mJ per action sample, while MK-SGN reduces energy consumption by more than 98%.

- **Summary**: Gait is a behavioral biometric modality that can be used to recognize individuals by the way they walk from a far distance. Most existing gait recognition approaches rely on either silhouettes or skeletons, while their joint use is underexplored. Features from silhouettes and skeletons can provide complementary information for more robust recognition against appearance changes or pose estimation errors. To exploit the benefits of both silhouette and skeleton features, we propose a new gait recognition network, referred to as the GaitPoint+. Our approach models skeleton key points as a 3D point cloud, and employs a computational complexity-conscious 3D point processing approach to extract skeleton features, which are then combined with silhouette features for improved accuracy. Since silhouette- or CNN-based methods already require considerable amount of computational resources, it is preferable that the key point learning module is faster and more lightweight. We present a detailed analysis of the utilization of every human key point after the use of traditional max-pooling, and show that while elbow and ankle points are used most commonly, many useful points are discarded by max-pooling. Thus, we present a method to recycle some of the discarded points by a Recycling Max-Pooling module, during processing of skeleton point clouds, and achieve further performance improvement. We provide a comprehensive set of experimental results showing that (i) incorporating skeleton features obtained by a point-based 3D point cloud processing approach boosts the performance of three different state-of-the-art silhouette- and CNN-based baselines; (ii) recycling the discarded points increases the accuracy further. Ablation studies are also provided to show the effectiveness and contribution of different components of our approach.

- **Summary**: Autonomous robot navigation and manipulation in open environments require reasoning and replanning with closed-loop feedback. We present COME-robot, the first closed-loop framework utilizing the GPT-4V vision-language foundation model for open-ended reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world scenarios. We meticulously construct a library of action primitives for robot exploration, navigation, and manipulation, serving as callable execution modules for GPT-4V in task planning. On top of these modules, GPT-4V serves as the brain that can accomplish multimodal reasoning, generate action policy with code, verify the task progress, and provide feedback for replanning. Such design enables COME-robot to (i) actively perceive the environments, (ii) perform situated reasoning, and (iii) recover from failures. Through comprehensive experiments involving 8 challenging real-world tabletop and manipulation tasks, COME-robot demonstrates a significant improvement in task success rate (~25%) compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We further conduct comprehensive analyses to elucidate how COME-robot's design facilitates failure recovery, free-form instruction following, and long-horizon task planning.

- **Summary**: We analyze knowledge-based visual question answering, for which given a question, the models need to ground it into the visual modality and retrieve the relevant knowledge from a given large knowledge base (KB) to be able to answer. Our analysis has two folds, one based on designing neural architectures and training them from scratch, and another based on large pre-trained language models (LLMs). Our research questions are: 1) Can we effectively augment models by explicit supervised retrieval of the relevant KB information to solve the KB-VQA problem? 2) How do task-specific and LLM-based models perform in the integration of visual and external knowledge, and multi-hop reasoning over both sources of information? 3) Is the implicit knowledge of LLMs sufficient for KB-VQA and to what extent it can replace the explicit KB? Our results demonstrate the positive impact of empowering task-specific and LLM models with supervised external and visual knowledge retrieval models. Our findings show that though LLMs are stronger in 1-hop reasoning, they suffer in 2-hop reasoning in comparison with our fine-tuned NN model even if the relevant information from both modalities is available to the model. Moreover, we observed that LLM models outperform the NN model for KB-related questions which confirms the effectiveness of implicit knowledge in LLMs however, they do not alleviate the need for external KB.

- **Summary**: This work proposes a novel learning framework for visual hand dynamics analysis that takes into account the physiological aspects of hand motion. The existing models, which are simplified joint-actuated systems, often produce unnatural motions. To address this, we integrate a musculoskeletal system with a learnable parametric hand model, MANO, to create a new model, MS-MANO. This model emulates the dynamics of muscles and tendons to drive the skeletal system, imposing physiologically realistic constraints on the resulting torque trajectories. We further propose a simulation-in-the-loop pose refinement framework, BioPR, that refines the initial estimated pose through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Our evaluation of the accuracy of MS-MANO and the efficacy of the BioPR is conducted in two separate parts. The accuracy of MS-MANO is compared with MyoSuite, while the efficacy of BioPR is benchmarked against two large-scale public datasets and two recent state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

- **Summary**: The burgeoning volume of digital content across diverse modalities necessitates efficient storage and retrieval methods. Conventional approaches struggle to cope with the escalating complexity and scale of multimedia data. In this paper, we proposed framework addresses this challenge by fusing AI-native multi-modal search capabilities with neural image compression. First we analyze the intricate relationship between compressibility and searchability, recognizing the pivotal role each plays in the efficiency of storage and retrieval systems. Through the usage of simple adapter is to bridge the feature of Learned Image Compression(LIC) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) while retaining semantic fidelity and retrieval of multi-modal data. Experimental evaluations on Kodak datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant enhancements in compression efficiency and search accuracy compared to existing methodologies. Our work marks a significant advancement towards scalable and efficient multi-modal search systems in the era of big data.

- **Summary**: Mixture of Expert Tuning (MoE-Tuning) has effectively enhanced the performance of general MLLMs with fewer parameters, yet its application in resource-limited medical settings has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we developed MoE-TinyMed, a model tailored for medical applications that significantly lowers parameter demands. In evaluations on the VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and Path-VQA datasets, MoE-TinyMed outperformed LLaVA-Med in all Med-VQA closed settings with just 3.6B parameters. Additionally, a streamlined version with 2B parameters surpassed LLaVA-Med's performance in PathVQA, showcasing its effectiveness in resource-limited healthcare settings.

- **Summary**: In the pursuit of robust and generalizable environment perception and language understanding, the ubiquitous challenge of dataset bias continues to plague vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents, hindering their performance in unseen environments. This paper introduces the generalized cross-modal causal transformer (GOAT), a pioneering solution rooted in the paradigm of causal inference. By delving into both observable and unobservable confounders within vision, language, and history, we propose the back-door and front-door adjustment causal learning (BACL and FACL) modules to promote unbiased learning by comprehensively mitigating potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to capture global confounder features, we propose a cross-modal feature pooling (CFP) module supervised by contrastive learning, which is also shown to be effective in improving cross-modal representations during pre-training. Extensive experiments across multiple VLN datasets (R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and SOON) underscore the superiority of our proposed method over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

- **Summary**: Featurizing microscopy images for use in biological research remains a significant challenge, especially for large-scale experiments spanning millions of images. This work explores the scaling properties of weakly supervised classifiers and self-supervised masked autoencoders (MAEs) when training with increasingly larger model backbones and microscopy datasets. Our results show that ViT-based MAEs outperform weakly supervised classifiers on a variety of tasks, achieving as much as a 11.5% relative improvement when recalling known biological relationships curated from public databases. Additionally, we develop a new channel-agnostic MAE architecture (CA-MAE) that allows for inputting images of different numbers and orders of channels at inference time. We demonstrate that CA-MAEs effectively generalize by inferring and evaluating on a microscopy image dataset (JUMP-CP) generated under different experimental conditions with a different channel structure than our pretraining data (RPI-93M). Our findings motivate continued research into scaling self-supervised learning on microscopy data in order to create powerful foundation models of cellular biology that have the potential to catalyze advancements in drug discovery and beyond.

- **Summary**: Scene understanding, defined as learning, extraction, and representation of interactions among traffic elements, is one of the critical challenges toward high-level autonomous driving (AD). Current scene understanding methods mainly focus on one concrete single task, such as trajectory prediction and risk level evaluation. Although they perform well on specific metrics, the generalization ability is insufficient to adapt to the real traffic complexity and downstream demand diversity. In this study, we propose PreGSU, a generalized pre-trained scene understanding model based on graph attention network to learn the universal interaction and reasoning of traffic scenes to support various downstream tasks. After the feature engineering and sub-graph module, all elements are embedded as nodes to form a dynamic weighted graph. Then, four graph attention layers are applied to learn the relationships among agents and lanes. In the pre-train phase, the understanding model is trained on two self-supervised tasks: Virtual Interaction Force (VIF) modeling and Masked Road Modeling (MRM). Based on the artificial potential field theory, VIF modeling enables PreGSU to capture the agent-to-agent interactions while MRM extracts agent-to-road connections. In the fine-tuning process, the pre-trained parameters are loaded to derive detailed understanding outputs. We conduct validation experiments on two downstream tasks, i.e., trajectory prediction in urban scenario, and intention recognition in highway scenario, to verify the generalized ability and understanding ability. Results show that compared with the baselines, PreGSU achieves better accuracy on both tasks, indicating the potential to be generalized to various scenes and targets. Ablation study shows the effectiveness of pre-train task design.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image generation. Yet its stochastic nature prevent artists from creating consistent images of the same character. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we argue that a lightweight but intricate guidance is enough to function. Aiming at this, we lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent generation, derive a clustering-based score function and propose a novel paradigm, OneActor. We design a cluster-conditioned model which incorporates posterior samples to guide the denoising trajectories towards the target cluster. To overcome the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we devise auxiliary components to simultaneously augment the tuning and regulate the inference. This technique is later verified to significantly enhance the content diversity of generated images. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory character consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. And our method is at least 4 times faster than tuning-based baselines. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we first prove that the semantic space has the same interpolation property as the latent space dose. This property can serve as another promising tool for fine generation control.

- **Summary**: Transmittance estimators such as Occupancy Grid (OG) can accelerate the training and rendering of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) by predicting important samples that contributes much to the generated image. However, OG manages occupied regions in the form of the dense binary grid, in which there are many blocks with the same values that cause redundant examination of voxels' emptiness in ray-tracing. In our work, we introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of ray-tracing in trained OG without fine-tuning. First, we replace the dense grids with VDB grids to reduce the spatial redundancy. Second, we use hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) to efficiently trace voxels in the VDB grids. Our experiments on NeRF-Synthetic and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets show that our proposed method successfully accelerates rendering NeRF-Synthetic dataset by 12% in average and Mip-NeRF 360 dataset by 4% in average, compared to a fast implementation of OG, NerfAcc, without losing the quality of rendered images.

- **Summary**: We present EucliDreamer, a simple and effective method to generate textures for 3D models given text prompts and meshes. The texture is parametrized as an implicit function on the 3D surface, which is optimized with the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) process and differentiable rendering. To generate high-quality textures, we leverage a depth-conditioned Stable Diffusion model guided by the depth image rendered from the mesh. We test our approach on 3D models in Objaverse and conducted a user study, which shows its superior quality compared to existing texturing methods like Text2Tex. In addition, our method converges 2 times faster than DreamFusion. Through text prompting, textures of diverse art styles can be produced. We hope Euclidreamer proides a viable solution to automate a labor-intensive stage in 3D content creation.

- **Summary**: Inductive biases are crucial in disentangled representation learning for narrowing down an underspecified solution set. In this work, we consider endowing a neural network autoencoder with three select inductive biases from the literature: data compression into a grid-like latent space via quantization, collective independence amongst latents, and minimal functional influence of any latent on how other latents determine data generation. In principle, these inductive biases are deeply complementary: they most directly specify properties of the latent space, encoder, and decoder, respectively. In practice, however, naively combining existing techniques instantiating these inductive biases fails to yield significant benefits. To address this, we propose adaptations to the three techniques that simplify the learning problem, equip key regularization terms with stabilizing invariances, and quash degenerate incentives. The resulting model, Tripod, achieves state-of-the-art results on a suite of four image disentanglement benchmarks. We also verify that Tripod significantly improves upon its naive incarnation and that all three of its "legs" are necessary for best performance.

- **Summary**: Seizure recurrence is an important concern after an initial unprovoked seizure; without drug treatment, it occurs within 2 years in 40-50% of cases. The decision to treat currently relies on predictors of seizure recurrence risk that are inaccurate, resulting in unnecessary, possibly harmful, treatment in some patients and potentially preventable seizures in others. Because of the link between brain lesions and seizure recurrence, we developed a recurrence prediction tool using machine learning and clinical 3T brain MRI. We developed NeuroMorphix, a feature construction approach based on MRI brain anatomy. Each of seven NeuroMorphix features measures the absolute or relative difference between corresponding regions in each cerebral hemisphere. FreeSurfer was used to segment brain regions and to generate values for morphometric parameters (8 for each cortical region and 5 for each subcortical region). The parameters were then mapped to whole brain NeuroMorphix features, yielding a total of 91 features per subject. Features were generated for a first seizure patient cohort (n = 169) categorised into seizure recurrence and non-recurrence subgroups. State-of-the-art classification algorithms were trained and tested using NeuroMorphix features to predict seizure recurrence. Classification models using the top 5 features, ranked by sequential forward selection, demonstrated excellent performance in predicting seizure recurrence, with area under the ROC curve of 88-93%, accuracy of 83-89%, and F1 score of 83-90%. Highly ranked features aligned with structural alterations known to be associated with epilepsy. This study highlights the potential for targeted, data-driven approaches to aid clinical decision-making in brain disorders.

- **Summary**: In text-based person search endeavors, data generation has emerged as a prevailing practice, addressing concerns over privacy preservation and the arduous task of manual annotation. Although the number of synthesized data can be infinite in theory, the scientific conundrum persists that how much generated data optimally fuels subsequent model training. We observe that only a subset of the data in these constructed datasets plays a decisive role. Therefore, we introduce a new Filtering-WoRA paradigm, which contains a filtering algorithm to identify this crucial data subset and WoRA (Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation) learning strategy for light fine-tuning. The filtering algorithm is based on the cross-modality relevance to remove the lots of coarse matching synthesis pairs. As the number of data decreases, we do not need to fine-tune the entire model. Therefore, we propose a WoRA learning strategy to efficiently update a minimal portion of model parameters. WoRA streamlines the learning process, enabling heightened efficiency in extracting knowledge from fewer, yet potent, data instances. Extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of pretraining, where our model achieves advanced and efficient retrieval performance on challenging real-world benchmarks. Notably, on the CUHK-PEDES dataset, we have achieved a competitive mAP of 67.02% while reducing model training time by 19.82%.

- **Summary**: The automatic recognition of tabular data in document images presents a significant challenge due to the diverse range of table styles and complex structures. Tables offer valuable content representation, enhancing the predictive capabilities of various systems such as search engines and Knowledge Graphs. Addressing the two main problems, namely table detection (TD) and table structure recognition (TSR), has traditionally been approached independently. In this research, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates deep learning models, including DETR, CascadeTabNet, and PP OCR v2, to achieve comprehensive image-based table recognition. This integrated approach effectively handles diverse table styles, complex structures, and image distortions, resulting in improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods like Table Transformers. Our system achieves simultaneous table detection (TD), table structure recognition (TSR), and table content recognition (TCR), preserving table structures and accurately extracting tabular data from document images. The integration of multiple models addresses the intricacies of table recognition, making our approach a promising solution for image-based table understanding, data extraction, and information retrieval applications. Our proposed approach achieves an IOU of 0.96 and an OCR Accuracy of 78%, showcasing a remarkable improvement of approximately 25% in the OCR Accuracy compared to the previous Table Transformer approach.

- **Summary**: Few-shot segmentation is a task to segment objects or regions of novel classes within an image given only a few annotated examples. In the generalized setting, the task extends to segment both the base and the novel classes. The main challenge is how to train the model such that the addition of novel classes does not hurt the base classes performance, also known as catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we use SegGPT as our base model and train it on the base classes. Then, we use separate learnable prompts to handle predictions for each novel class. To handle various object sizes which typically present in remote sensing domain, we perform patch-based prediction. To address the discontinuities along patch boundaries, we propose a patch-and-stitch technique by re-framing the problem as an image inpainting task. During inference, we also utilize image similarity search over image embeddings for prompt selection and novel class filtering to reduce false positive predictions. Based on our experiments, our proposed method boosts the weighted mIoU of a simple fine-tuned SegGPT from 15.96 to 35.08 on the validation set of few-shot OpenEarthMap dataset given in the challenge.

- **Summary**: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) are commonly used in real-world visual tasks, and high-resolution ODIs help improve the performance of related visual tasks. Most existing super-resolution methods for ODIs use end-to-end learning strategies, resulting in inferior realness of generated images and a lack of effective out-of-domain generalization capabilities in training methods. Image generation methods represented by diffusion model provide strong priors for visual tasks and have been proven to be effectively applied to image restoration tasks. Leveraging the image priors of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, we achieve omnidirectional image super-resolution with both fidelity and realness, dubbed as OmniSSR. Firstly, we transform the equirectangular projection (ERP) images into tangent projection (TP) images, whose distribution approximates the planar image domain. Then, we use SD to iteratively sample initial high-resolution results. At each denoising iteration, we further correct and update the initial results using the proposed Octadecaplex Tangent Information Interaction (OTII) and Gradient Decomposition (GD) technique to ensure better consistency. Finally, the TP images are transformed back to obtain the final high-resolution results. Our method is zero-shot, requiring no training or fine-tuning. Experiments of our method on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

- **Summary**: One of the ways to make artificial intelligence more natural is to give it some room for doubt. Two main questions should be resolved in that way. First, how to train a model to estimate uncertainties of its own predictions? And then, what to do with the uncertain predictions if they appear? First, we proposed an uncertainty-aware negative log-likelihood loss for the case of N-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with spherical variance matrix to the solution of N-classes classification tasks. The loss is similar to the heteroscedastic regression loss. The proposed model regularizes uncertain predictions, and trains to calculate both the predictions and their uncertainty estimations. The model fits well with the label smoothing technique. Second, we expanded the limits of data augmentation at the training and test stages, and made the trained model to give multiple predictions for a given number of augmented versions of each test sample. Given the multi-view predictions together with their uncertainties and confidences, we proposed several methods to calculate final predictions, including mode values and bin counts with soft and hard weights. For the latter method, we formalized the model tuning task in the form of multimodal optimization with non-differentiable criteria of maximum accuracy, and applied particle swarm optimization to solve the tuning task. The proposed methodology was tested using CIFAR-10 dataset with clean and noisy labels and demonstrated good results in comparison with other uncertainty estimation methods related to sample selection, co-teaching, and label smoothing.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity as a novel explicit 3D representation. This approach relies on the representation power of Gaussian primitives to provide a high-quality rendering. However, primitives optimized at low resolution inevitably exhibit sparsity and texture deficiency, posing a challenge for achieving high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS). To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting (SRGS) to perform the optimization in a high-resolution (HR) space. The sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space, exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution (LR) views. The gradient accumulated from more viewpoints will facilitate the densification of primitives. Furthermore, a pre-trained 2D super-resolution model is integrated with the sub-pixel constraint, enabling these dense primitives to learn faithful texture features. In general, our method focuses on densification and texture learning to effectively enhance the representation ability of primitives. Experimentally, our method achieves high rendering quality on HRNVS only with LR inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets such as Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples. Related codes will be released upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) has achieved great success on segmenting objects of novel classes, supported by only a few annotated samples. However, existing FSS methods often underperform in the presence of domain shifts, especially when encountering new domain styles that are unseen during training. It is suboptimal to directly adapt or generalize the entire model to new domains in the few-shot scenario. Instead, our key idea is to adapt a small adapter for rectifying diverse target domain styles to the source domain. Consequently, the rectified target domain features can fittingly benefit from the well-optimized source domain segmentation model, which is intently trained on sufficient source domain data. Training domain-rectifying adapter requires sufficiently diverse target domains. We thus propose a novel local-global style perturbation method to simulate diverse potential target domains by perturbating the feature channel statistics of the individual images and collective statistics of the entire source domain, respectively. Additionally, we propose a cyclic domain alignment module to facilitate the adapter effectively rectifying domains using a reverse domain rectification supervision. The adapter is trained to rectify the image features from diverse synthesized target domains to align with the source domain. During testing on target domains, we start by rectifying the image features and then conduct few-shot segmentation on the domain-rectified features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving promising results on cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation tasks.

- **Summary**: Despite achieving outstanding performance on various cross-modal tasks, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucination issues, manifesting as inconsistencies between their generated responses and the corresponding images. Prior research has implicated that the low quality of instruction data, particularly the skewed balance between positive and negative samples, is a significant contributor to model hallucinations. Recently, researchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as LRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our investigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit specificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies significantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the hallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby diminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we propose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that tailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG consists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary information from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis; and targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based on diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more effective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.

- **Summary**: Targeted transfer-based attacks involving adversarial examples pose a significant threat to large visual-language models (VLMs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) transfer-based attacks incur high costs due to excessive iteration counts. Furthermore, the generated adversarial examples exhibit pronounced adversarial noise and demonstrate limited efficacy in evading defense methods such as DiffPure. To address these issues, inspired by score matching, we introduce AdvDiffVLM, which utilizes diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted adversarial examples. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM employs Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation to modify the score during the diffusion model's reverse generation process, ensuring the adversarial examples produced contain natural adversarial semantics and thus possess enhanced transferability. Simultaneously, to enhance the quality of adversarial examples further, we employ the GradCAM-guided Mask method to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image, rather than concentrating them in a specific area. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a speedup ranging from 10X to 30X compared to existing transfer-based attack methods, while maintaining superior quality of adversarial examples. Additionally, the generated adversarial examples possess strong transferability and exhibit increased robustness against adversarial defense methods. Notably, AdvDiffVLM can successfully attack commercial VLMs, including GPT-4V, in a black-box manner.

- **Summary**: In reality, images often exhibit multiple degradations, such as rain and fog at night (triple degradations). However, in many cases, individuals may not want to remove all degradations, for instance, a blurry lens revealing a beautiful snowy landscape (double degradations). In such scenarios, people may only desire to deblur. These situations and requirements shed light on a new challenge in image restoration, where a model must perceive and remove specific degradation types specified by human commands in images with multiple degradations. We term this task Referring Flexible Image Restoration (RFIR). To address this, we first construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called RFIR, comprising 153,423 samples with the degraded image, text prompt for specific degradation removal and restored image. RFIR consists of five basic degradation types: blur, rain, haze, low light and snow while six main sub-categories are included for varying degrees of degradation removal. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel transformer-based multi-task model named TransRFIR, which simultaneously perceives degradation types in the degraded image and removes specific degradation upon text prompt. TransRFIR is based on two devised attention modules, Multi-Head Agent Self-Attention (MHASA) and Multi-Head Agent Cross Attention (MHACA), where MHASA and MHACA introduce the agent token and reach the linear complexity, achieving lower computation cost than vanilla self-attention and cross-attention and obtaining competitive performances. Our TransRFIR achieves state-of-the-art performances compared with other counterparts and is proven as an effective architecture for image restoration. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/FIR-CP.

- **Summary**: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the NTIRE 2024 challenge, focusing on efficient single-image super-resolution (ESR) solutions and their outcomes. The task of this challenge is to super-resolve an input image with a magnification factor of x4 based on pairs of low and corresponding high-resolution images. The primary objective is to develop networks that optimize various aspects such as runtime, parameters, and FLOPs, while still maintaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of approximately 26.90 dB on the DIV2K_LSDIR_valid dataset and 26.99 dB on the DIV2K_LSDIR_test dataset. In addition, this challenge has 4 tracks including the main track (overall performance), sub-track 1 (runtime), sub-track 2 (FLOPs), and sub-track 3 (parameters). In the main track, all three metrics (ie runtime, FLOPs, and parameter count) were considered. The ranking of the main track is calculated based on a weighted sum-up of the scores of all other sub-tracks. In sub-track 1, the practical runtime performance of the submissions was evaluated, and the corresponding score was used to determine the ranking. In sub-track 2, the number of FLOPs was considered. The score calculated based on the corresponding FLOPs was used to determine the ranking. In sub-track 3, the number of parameters was considered. The score calculated based on the corresponding parameters was used to determine the ranking. RLFN is set as the baseline for efficiency measurement. The challenge had 262 registered participants, and 34 teams made valid submissions. They gauge the state-of-the-art in efficient single-image super-resolution. To facilitate the reproducibility of the challenge and enable other researchers to build upon these findings, the code and the pre-trained model of validated solutions are made publicly available at https://github.com/Amazingren/NTIRE2024_ESR/.

- **Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, play a foundational role in various cross-modal applications. To fully leverage VLMs' potential in adapting to downstream tasks, context optimization methods like Prompt Tuning are essential. However, one key limitation is the lack of diversity in prompt templates, whether they are hand-crafted or learned through additional modules. This limitation restricts the capabilities of pretrained VLMs and can result in incorrect predictions in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Context Optimization with Multi-Knowledge Representation (CoKnow), a framework that enhances Prompt Learning for VLMs with rich contextual knowledge. To facilitate CoKnow during inference, we trained lightweight semantic knowledge mappers, which are capable of generating Multi-Knowledge Representation for an input image without requiring additional priors. Experimentally, We conducted extensive experiments on 11 publicly available datasets, demonstrating that CoKnow outperforms a series of previous methods. We will make all resources open-source: https://github.com/EMZucas/CoKnow.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we address the Bracket Image Restoration and Enhancement (BracketIRE) task using a novel framework, which requires restoring a high-quality high dynamic range (HDR) image from a sequence of noisy, blurred, and low dynamic range (LDR) multi-exposure RAW inputs. To overcome this challenge, we present the IREANet, which improves the multiple exposure alignment and aggregation with a Flow-guide Feature Alignment Module (FFAM) and an Enhanced Feature Aggregation Module (EFAM). Specifically, the proposed FFAM incorporates the inter-frame optical flow as guidance to facilitate the deformable alignment and spatial attention modules for better feature alignment. The EFAM further employs the proposed Enhanced Residual Block (ERB) as a foundational component, wherein a unidirectional recurrent network aggregates the aligned temporal features to better reconstruct the results. To improve model generalization and performance, we additionally employ the Bayer preserving augmentation (BayerAug) strategy to augment the multi-exposure RAW inputs. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed IREANet shows state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods.

- **Summary**: Open set recognition (OSR) is a critical aspect of machine learning, addressing the challenge of detecting novel classes during inference. Within the realm of deep learning, neural classifiers trained on a closed set of data typically struggle to identify novel classes, leading to erroneous predictions. To address this issue, various heuristic methods have been proposed, allowing models to express uncertainty by stating "I don't know." However, a gap in the literature remains, as there has been limited exploration of the underlying mechanisms of these methods. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of open set recognition methods, focusing on the aspect of feature diversity. Our research reveals a significant correlation between learning diverse discriminative features and enhancing OSR performance. Building on this insight, we propose a novel OSR approach that leverages the advantages of feature diversity. The efficacy of our method is substantiated through rigorous evaluation on a standard OSR testbench, demonstrating a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: Synthetic data is gaining increasing relevance for training machine learning models. This is mainly motivated due to several factors such as the lack of real data and intra-class variability, time and errors produced in manual labeling, and in some cases privacy concerns, among others. This paper presents an overview of the 2nd edition of the Face Recognition Challenge in the Era of Synthetic Data (FRCSyn) organized at CVPR 2024. FRCSyn aims to investigate the use of synthetic data in face recognition to address current technological limitations, including data privacy concerns, demographic biases, generalization to novel scenarios, and performance constraints in challenging situations such as aging, pose variations, and occlusions. Unlike the 1st edition, in which synthetic data from DCFace and GANDiffFace methods was only allowed to train face recognition systems, in this 2nd edition we propose new sub-tasks that allow participants to explore novel face generative methods. The outcomes of the 2nd FRCSyn Challenge, along with the proposed experimental protocol and benchmarking contribute significantly to the application of synthetic data to face recognition.

- **Summary**: Human action recognition and performance assessment have been hot research topics in recent years. Recognition problems have mature solutions in the field of sign language, but past research in performance analysis has focused on competitive sports and medical training, overlooking the scoring assessment ,which is an important part of sign language teaching digitalization. In this paper, we analyze the existing technologies for performance assessment and adopt methods that perform well in human pose reconstruction tasks combined with motion rotation embedded expressions, proposing a two-stage sign language performance evaluation pipeline. Our analysis shows that choosing reconstruction tasks in the first stage can provide more expressive features, and using smoothing methods can provide an effective reference for assessment. Experiments show that our method provides good score feedback mechanisms and high consistency with professional assessments compared to end-to-end evaluations.

- **Summary**: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has gained significant attention due to the widespread use of complex deep learning models in high-stake domains such as medicine, finance, and autonomous cars. However, different explanations often present different aspects of the model's behavior. In this research manuscript, we explore the potential of ensembling explanations generated by deep classification models using convolutional model. Through experimentation and analysis, we aim to investigate the implications of combining explanations to uncover a more coherent and reliable patterns of the model's behavior, leading to the possibility of evaluating the representation learned by the model. With our method, we can uncover problems of under-representation of images in a certain class. Moreover, we discuss other side benefits like features' reduction by replacing the original image with its explanations resulting in the removal of some sensitive information. Through the use of carefully selected evaluation metrics from the Quantus library, we demonstrated the method's superior performance in terms of Localisation and Faithfulness, compared to individual explanations.

- **Summary**: Existing neural rendering-based text-to-3D-portrait generation methods typically make use of human geometry prior and diffusion models to obtain guidance. However, relying solely on geometry information introduces issues such as the Janus problem, over-saturation, and over-smoothing. We present Portrait3D, a novel neural rendering-based framework with a novel joint geometry-appearance prior to achieve text-to-3D-portrait generation that overcomes the aforementioned issues. To accomplish this, we train a 3D portrait generator, 3DPortraitGAN-Pyramid, as a robust prior. This generator is capable of producing 360{\deg} canonical 3D portraits, serving as a starting point for the subsequent diffusion-based generation process. To mitigate the "grid-like" artifact caused by the high-frequency information in the feature-map-based 3D representation commonly used by most 3D-aware GANs, we integrate a novel pyramid tri-grid 3D representation into 3DPortraitGAN-Pyramid. To generate 3D portraits from text, we first project a randomly generated image aligned with the given prompt into the pre-trained 3DPortraitGAN-Pyramid's latent space. The resulting latent code is then used to synthesize a pyramid tri-grid. Beginning with the obtained pyramid tri-grid, we use score distillation sampling to distill the diffusion model's knowledge into the pyramid tri-grid. Following that, we utilize the diffusion model to refine the rendered images of the 3D portrait and then use these refined images as training data to further optimize the pyramid tri-grid, effectively eliminating issues with unrealistic color and unnatural artifacts. Our experimental results show that Portrait3D can produce realistic, high-quality, and canonical 3D portraits that align with the prompt.

- **Summary**: Image recognition techniques heavily rely on abundant labeled data, particularly in medical contexts. Addressing the challenges associated with obtaining labeled data has led to the prominence of self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, especially in scenarios with limited annotated data. In this paper, we proposed an innovative approach by integrating self-supervised learning into semi-supervised models to enhance medical image recognition. Our methodology commences with pre-training on unlabeled data utilizing the BYOL method. Subsequently, we merge pseudo-labeled and labeled datasets to construct a neural network classifier, refining it through iterative fine-tuning. Experimental results on three different datasets demonstrate that our approach optimally leverages unlabeled data, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy for medical image recognition.

- **Summary**: Vision Transformers (ViT) have marked a paradigm shift in computer vision, outperforming state-of-the-art models across diverse tasks. However, their practical deployment is hampered by high computational and memory demands. This study addresses the challenge by evaluating four primary model compression techniques: quantization, low-rank approximation, knowledge distillation, and pruning. We methodically analyze and compare the efficacy of these techniques and their combinations in optimizing ViTs for resource-constrained environments. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that these methods facilitate a balanced compromise between model accuracy and computational efficiency, paving the way for wider application in edge computing devices.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, deep learning models have reached incredible performance in the task of image generation. Plenty of literature works address the task of face generation and editing, with human and automatic systems that struggle to distinguish what's real from generated. Whereas most systems reached excellent visual generation quality, they still face difficulties in preserving the identity of the starting input subject. Among all the explored techniques, Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) methods, whose goal is to generate an image conditioned on a semantic segmentation mask, are the most promising, even though preserving the perceived identity of the input subject is not their main concern. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problem of identity preservation in face image generation and present an SIS architecture that exploits a cross-attention mechanism to merge identity, style, and semantic features to generate faces whose identities are as similar as possible to the input ones. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method is not only suitable for preserving the identity but is also effective in the face recognition adversarial attack, i.e. hiding a second identity in the generated faces.

- **Summary**: We present a scalable framework designed to craft efficient lightweight models for video object detection utilizing self-training and knowledge distillation techniques. We scrutinize methodologies for the ideal selection of training images from video streams and the efficacy of model sharing across numerous cameras. By advocating for a camera clustering methodology, we aim to diminish the requisite number of models for training while augmenting the distillation dataset. The findings affirm that proper camera clustering notably amplifies the accuracy of distilled models, eclipsing the methodologies that employ distinct models for each camera or a universal model trained on the aggregate camera data.

- **Summary**: Motivation. While recent studies show high accuracy in the classification of Alzheimer's disease using deep neural networks, the underlying learned concepts have not been investigated.   Goals. To systematically identify changes in brain regions through concepts learned by the deep neural network for model validation.   Approach. Using quantitative R2* maps we separated Alzheimer's patients (n=117) from normal controls (n=219) by using a convolutional neural network and systematically investigated the learned concepts using Concept Relevance Propagation and compared these results to a conventional region of interest-based analysis.   Results. In line with established histological findings and the region of interest-based analyses, highly relevant concepts were primarily found in and adjacent to the basal ganglia.   Impact. The identification of concepts learned by deep neural networks for disease classification enables validation of the models and could potentially improve reliability.

- **Summary**: Pose refinement is an interesting and practically relevant research direction. Pose refinement can be used to (1) obtain a more accurate pose estimate from an initial prior (e.g., from retrieval), (2) as pre-processing, i.e., to provide a better starting point to a more expensive pose estimator, (3) as post-processing of a more accurate localizer. Existing approaches focus on learning features / scene representations for the pose refinement task. This involves training an implicit scene representation or learning features while optimizing a camera pose-based loss. A natural question is whether training specific features / representations is truly necessary or whether similar results can be already achieved with more generic features. In this work, we present a simple approach that combines pre-trained features with a particle filter and a renderable representation of the scene. Despite its simplicity, it achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating that one can easily build a pose refiner without the need for specific training.

- **Summary**: The rapid growth of the Industry 4.0 paradigm is increasing the pressure to develop effective automated monitoring systems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a convenient tool to improve the efficiency of industrial processes while reducing errors and waste. In fact, it allows the use of real-time data to increase the effectiveness of monitoring systems, minimize errors, make the production process more sustainable, and save costs. In this paper, a novel automatic monitoring system is proposed in the context of production process of plastic consumables used in analysis laboratories, with the aim to increase the effectiveness of the control process currently performed by a human operator. In particular, we considered the problem of classifying the presence or absence of a transparent anticoagulant substance inside test tubes. Specifically, a hand-designed deep network model is used and compared with some state-of-the-art models for its ability to categorize different images of vials that can be either filled with the anticoagulant or empty. Collected results indicate that the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, we increased the complexity of the task by training the models on the ability to discriminate not only the presence or absence of the anticoagulant inside the vial, but also the size of the test tube. The analysis performed in the latter scenario confirms the competitiveness of our approach. Moreover, our model is remarkably superior in terms of its generalization ability and requires significantly fewer resources. These results suggest the possibility of successfully implementing such a model in the production process of a plastic consumables company.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks are increasingly used in a wide range of technologies and services, but remain highly susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, that is, drawn from a different distribution than the original training set. A common approach to address this issue is to endow deep neural networks with the ability to detect OOD samples. Several benchmarks have been proposed to design and validate OOD detection techniques. However, many of them are based on far-OOD samples drawn from very different distributions, and thus lack the complexity needed to capture the nuances of real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for OOD detection, based on ImageNet and Places365, that assigns individual classes as in-distribution or out-of-distribution depending on the semantic similarity with the training set. Several techniques can be used to determine which classes should be considered in-distribution, yielding benchmarks with varying properties. Experimental results on different OOD detection techniques show how their measured efficacy depends on the selected benchmark and how confidence-based techniques may outperform classifier-based ones on near-OOD samples.

- **Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) technique couples 3D Gaussian primitives with differentiable rasterization to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis results while providing advanced real-time rendering performance. However, due to the flaw of its adaptive density control strategy in 3D-GS, it frequently suffers from over-reconstruction issue in intricate scenes containing high-frequency details, leading to blurry rendered images. The underlying reason for the flaw has still been under-explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the cause of aforementioned artifacts, namely gradient collision, which prevents large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions from splitting. To address this issue, we propose the novel homodirectional view-space positional gradient as the criterion for densification. Our strategy efficiently identifies large Gaussians in over-reconstructed regions, and recovers fine details by splitting. We evaluate our proposed method on various challenging datasets. The experimental results indicate that our approach achieves the best rendering quality with reduced or similar memory consumption. Our method is easy to implement and can be incorporated into a wide variety of most recent Gaussian Splatting-based methods. We will open source our codes upon formal publication.

- **Summary**: Traditional sign language teaching methods face challenges such as limited feedback and diverse learning scenarios. Although 2D resources lack real-time feedback, classroom teaching is constrained by a scarcity of teacher. Methods based on VR and AR have relatively primitive interaction feedback mechanisms. This study proposes an innovative teaching model that uses real-time monocular vision and mixed reality technology. First, we introduce an improved hand-posture reconstruction method to achieve sign language semantic retention and real-time feedback. Second, a ternary system evaluation algorithm is proposed for a comprehensive assessment, maintaining good consistency with experts in sign language. Furthermore, we use mixed reality technology to construct a scenario-based 3D sign language classroom and explore the user experience of scenario teaching. Overall, this paper presents a novel teaching method that provides an immersive learning experience, advanced posture reconstruction, and precise feedback, achieving positive feedback on user experience and learning effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Recent large vision models (e.g., SAM) enjoy great potential to facilitate intelligent perception with high accuracy. Yet, the resource constraints in the IoT environment tend to limit such large vision models to be locally deployed, incurring considerable inference latency thereby making it difficult to support real-time applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. Edge-cloud collaboration with large-small model co-inference offers a promising approach to achieving high inference accuracy and low latency. However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods are tightly coupled with the model architecture and cannot adapt to the dynamic data drifts in heterogeneous IoT environments. To address the issues, we propose LAECIPS, a new edge-cloud collaboration framework. In LAECIPS, both the large vision model on the cloud and the lightweight model on the edge are plug-and-play. We design an edge-cloud collaboration strategy based on hard input mining, optimized for both high accuracy and low latency. We propose to update the edge model and its collaboration strategy with the cloud under the supervision of the large vision model, so as to adapt to the dynamic IoT data streams. Theoretical analysis of LAECIPS proves its feasibility. Experiments conducted in a robotic semantic segmentation system using real-world datasets show that LAECIPS outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors in accuracy, latency, and communication overhead while having better adaptability to dynamic environments.

- **Summary**: Noisy label learning aims to learn robust networks under the supervision of noisy labels, which plays a critical role in deep learning. Existing work either conducts sample selection or label correction to deal with noisy labels during the model training process. In this paper, we design a simple yet effective sample selection framework, termed Two-Stream Sample Distillation (TSSD), for noisy label learning, which can extract more high-quality samples with clean labels to improve the robustness of network training. Firstly, a novel Parallel Sample Division (PSD) module is designed to generate a certain training set with sufficient reliable positive and negative samples by jointly considering the sample structure in feature space and the human prior in loss space. Secondly, a novel Meta Sample Purification (MSP) module is further designed to mine adequate semi-hard samples from the remaining uncertain training set by learning a strong meta classifier with extra golden data. As a result, more and more high-quality samples will be distilled from the noisy training set to train networks robustly in every iteration. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and Clothing-1M, show that our method has achieved state-of-the-art results over its competitors.

- **Summary**: This paper makes the first attempt towards unsupervised preference alignment in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We generate chosen and rejected responses with regard to the original and augmented image pairs, and conduct preference alignment with direct preference optimization. It is based on a core idea: properly designed augmentation to the image input will induce VLM to generate false but hard negative responses, which helps the model to learn from and produce more robust and powerful answers. The whole pipeline no longer hinges on supervision from GPT4 or human involvement during alignment, and is highly efficient with few lines of code. With only 8k randomly sampled unsupervised data, it achieves 90\% relative score to GPT-4 on complex reasoning in LLaVA-Bench, and improves LLaVA-7B/13B by 6.7\%/5.6\% score on complex multi-modal benchmark MM-Vet. Visualizations shows its improved ability to align with user-intentions. A series of ablations are firmly conducted to reveal the latent mechanism of the approach, which also indicates its potential towards further scaling. Code will be available.

- **Summary**: We present the latest generation of MobileNets, known as MobileNetV4 (MNv4), featuring universally efficient architecture designs for mobile devices. At its core, we introduce the Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) search block, a unified and flexible structure that merges Inverted Bottleneck (IB), ConvNext, Feed Forward Network (FFN), and a novel Extra Depthwise (ExtraDW) variant. Alongside UIB, we present Mobile MQA, an attention block tailored for mobile accelerators, delivering a significant 39% speedup. An optimized neural architecture search (NAS) recipe is also introduced which improves MNv4 search effectiveness. The integration of UIB, Mobile MQA and the refined NAS recipe results in a new suite of MNv4 models that are mostly Pareto optimal across mobile CPUs, DSPs, GPUs, as well as specialized accelerators like Apple Neural Engine and Google Pixel EdgeTPU - a characteristic not found in any other models tested. Finally, to further boost accuracy, we introduce a novel distillation technique. Enhanced by this technique, our MNv4-Hybrid-Large model delivers 87% ImageNet-1K accuracy, with a Pixel 8 EdgeTPU runtime of just 3.8ms.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present SPVLoc, a global indoor localization method that accurately determines the six-dimensional (6D) camera pose of a query image and requires minimal scene-specific prior knowledge and no scene-specific training. Our approach employs a novel matching procedure to localize the perspective camera's viewport, given as an RGB image, within a set of panoramic semantic layout representations of the indoor environment. The panoramas are rendered from an untextured 3D reference model, which only comprises approximate structural information about room shapes, along with door and window annotations. We demonstrate that a straightforward convolutional network structure can successfully achieve image-to-panorama and ultimately image-to-model matching. Through a viewport classification score, we rank reference panoramas and select the best match for the query image. Then, a 6D relative pose is estimated between the chosen panorama and query image. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach not only efficiently bridges the domain gap but also generalizes well to previously unseen scenes that are not part of the training data. Moreover, it achieves superior localization accuracy compared to the state of the art methods and also estimates more degrees of freedom of the camera pose. We will make our source code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/spvloc .

- **Summary**: Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed cancerous disease among men world-wide. Even with modern technology such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance tomography and guided biopsies, the process for diagnosing prostate cancer remains time consuming and requires highly trained professionals. In this paper, different convolutional neural networks (CNN) are evaluated on their abilities to reliably classify whether an MRI sequence contains malignant lesions. Implementations of a ResNet, a ConvNet and a ConvNeXt for 3D image data are trained and evaluated. The models are trained using different data augmentation techniques, learning rates, and optimizers. The data is taken from a private dataset, provided by Cantonal Hospital Aarau. The best result was achieved by a ResNet3D, yielding an average precision score of 0.4583 and AUC ROC score of 0.6214.

- **Summary**: Occlusions hinder point cloud frame alignment in LiDAR data, a challenge inadequately addressed by scene flow models tested mainly on occlusion-free datasets. Attempts to integrate occlusion handling within networks often suffer accuracy issues due to two main limitations: a) the inadequate use of occlusion information, often merging it with flow estimation without an effective integration strategy, and b) reliance on distance-weighted upsampling that falls short in correcting occlusion-related errors. To address these challenges, we introduce the Correlation Matrix Upsampling Flownet (CMU-Flownet), incorporating an occlusion estimation module within its cost volume layer, alongside an Occlusion-aware Cost Volume (OCV) mechanism. Specifically, we propose an enhanced upsampling approach that expands the sensory field of the sampling process which integrates a Correlation Matrix designed to evaluate point-level similarity. Meanwhile, our model robustly integrates occlusion data within the context of scene flow, deploying this information strategically during the refinement phase of the flow estimation. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through subsequent experimental validation. Empirical assessments reveal that CMU-Flownet establishes state-of-the-art performance within the realms of occluded Flyingthings3D and KITTY datasets, surpassing previous methodologies across a majority of evaluated metrics.

- **Summary**: Whole brain parcellation requires inferring hundreds of segmentation labels in large image volumes and thus presents significant practical challenges for deep learning approaches. We introduce label merge-and-split, a method that first greatly reduces the effective number of labels required for learning-based whole brain parcellation and then recovers original labels. Using a greedy graph colouring algorithm, our method automatically groups and merges multiple spatially separate labels prior to model training and inference. The merged labels may be semantically unrelated. A deep learning model is trained to predict merged labels. At inference time, original labels are restored using atlas-based influence regions. In our experiments, the proposed approach reduces the number of labels by up to 68% while achieving segmentation accuracy comparable to the baseline method without label merging and splitting. Moreover, model training and inference times as well as GPU memory requirements were reduced significantly. The proposed method can be applied to all semantic segmentation tasks with a large number of spatially separate classes within an atlas-based prior.

- **Summary**: Standard Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target but usually requires simultaneous access to both source and target data. Moreover, UDA approaches commonly assume that source and target domains share the same labels space. Yet, these two assumptions are hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios. This paper considers the more challenging Source-Free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting, where both assumptions are dropped. We propose a novel approach for SF-OSDA that exploits the granularity of target-private categories by segregating their samples into multiple unknown classes. Starting from an initial clustering-based assignment, our method progressively improves the segregation of target-private samples by refining their pseudo-labels with the guide of an uncertainty-based sample selection module. Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive loss, named NL-InfoNCELoss, that, integrating negative learning into self-supervised contrastive learning, enhances the model robustness to noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, additional analyses show that our method is able to learn the underlying semantics of novel classes, opening the possibility to perform novel class discovery.

- **Summary**: A key challenge in contrastive learning is to generate negative samples from a large sample set to contrast with positive samples, for learning better encoding of the data. These negative samples often follow a softmax distribution which are dynamically updated during the training process. However, sampling from this distribution is non-trivial due to the high computational costs in computing the partition function. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo negative sampling method for Contrastive learning (EMC$^2$). We follow the global contrastive learning loss as introduced in SogCLR, and propose EMC$^2$ which utilizes an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings subroutine to generate hardness-aware negative samples in an online fashion during the optimization. We prove that EMC$^2$ finds an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$-stationary point of the global contrastive loss in $T$ iterations. Compared to prior works, EMC$^2$ is the first algorithm that exhibits global convergence (to stationarity) regardless of the choice of batch size while exhibiting low computation and memory cost. Numerical experiments validate that EMC$^2$ is effective with small batch training and achieves comparable or better performance than baseline algorithms. We report the results for pre-training image encoders on STL-10 and Imagenet-100.

- **Summary**: The fusion of images from dual camera systems featuring a wide-angle and a telephoto camera has become a hotspot problem recently. By integrating simultaneously captured wide-angle and telephoto images from these systems, the resulting fused image achieves a wide field of view (FOV) coupled with high-definition quality. Existing approaches are mostly deep learning methods, and predominantly rely on supervised learning, where the training dataset plays a pivotal role. However, current datasets typically adopt a data synthesis approach generate input pairs of wide-angle and telephoto images alongside ground-truth images. Notably, the wide-angle inputs are synthesized rather than captured using real wide-angle cameras, and the ground-truth image is captured by wide-angle camera whose quality is substantially lower than that of input telephoto images captured by telephoto cameras. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel hardware setup utilizing a beam splitter to simultaneously capture three images, i.e. input pairs and ground-truth images, from two authentic cellphones equipped with wide-angle and telephoto dual cameras. Specifically, the wide-angle and telephoto images captured by cellphone 2 serve as the input pair, while the telephoto image captured by cellphone 1, which is calibrated to match the optical path of the wide-angle image from cellphone 2, serves as the ground-truth image, maintaining quality on par with the input telephoto image. Experiments validate the efficacy of our newly introduced dataset, named ReWiTe, significantly enhances the performance of various existing methods for real-world wide-angle and telephoto dual image fusion tasks.

- **Summary**: We leverage diffusion models to study the robustness-performance tradeoff of robust classifiers. Our approach introduces a simple, pretrained diffusion method to generate low-norm counterfactual examples (CEs): semantically altered data which results in different true class membership. We report that the confidence and accuracy of robust models on their clean training data are associated with the proximity of the data to their CEs. Moreover, robust models perform very poorly when evaluated on the CEs directly, as they become increasingly invariant to the low-norm, semantic changes brought by CEs. The results indicate a significant overlap between non-robust and semantic features, countering the common assumption that non-robust features are not interpretable.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), due to the remarkable visual reasoning ability to understand images and videos, have received widespread attention in the autonomous driving domain, which significantly advances the development of interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving. However, current evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in common scenarios, lacking quantifiable and automated assessment in autonomous driving contexts, let alone severe road corner cases that even the state-of-the-art autonomous driving perception systems struggle to handle. In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, a novel vision-language benchmark for self-driving, which provides the first automatic and quantitative evaluation of LVLMs for interpretable autonomous driving including general perception, regional perception, and driving suggestions. CODA-LM utilizes the texts to describe the road images, exploiting powerful text-only large language models (LLMs) without image inputs to assess the capabilities of LVLMs in autonomous driving scenarios, which reveals stronger alignment with human preferences than LVLM judges. Experiments demonstrate that even the closed-sourced commercial LVLMs like GPT-4V cannot deal with road corner cases well, suggesting that we are still far from a strong LVLM-powered intelligent driving agent, and we hope our CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote future development.

- **Summary**: A positive margin may result in an increased risk of local recurrences after breast retention surgery for any malignant tumour. In order to reduce the number of positive margins would offer surgeon real-time intra-operative information on the presence of positive resection margins. This study aims to design an intra-operative tumour margin evaluation scheme by using specimen mammography in breast-conserving surgery. Total of 30 cases were evaluated and compared with the manually determined contours by experienced physicians and pathology report. The proposed method utilizes image thresholding to extract regions of interest and then performs a deep learning model, i.e. SegNet, to segment tumour tissue. The margin width of normal tissues surrounding it is evaluated as the result. The desired size of margin around the tumor was set for 10 mm. The smallest average difference to manual sketched margin (6.53 mm +- 5.84). In the all case, the SegNet architecture was utilized to obtain tissue specimen boundary and tumor contour, respectively. The simulation results indicated that this technology is helpful in discriminating positive from negative margins in the intra-operative setting. The aim of proposed scheme was a potential procedure in the intra-operative measurement system. The experimental results reveal that deep learning techniques can draw results that are consistent with pathology reports.

- **Summary**: Leveraging multi-view diffusion models as priors for 3D optimization have alleviated the problem of 3D consistency, e.g., the Janus face problem or the content drift problem, in zero-shot text-to-3D models. However, the 3D geometric fidelity of the output remains an unresolved issue; albeit the rendered 2D views are realistic, the underlying geometry may contain errors such as unreasonable concavities. In this work, we propose CorrespondentDream, an effective method to leverage annotation-free, cross-view correspondences yielded from the diffusion U-Net to provide additional 3D prior to the NeRF optimization process. We find that these correspondences are strongly consistent with human perception, and by adopting it in our loss design, we are able to produce NeRF models with geometries that are more coherent with common sense, e.g., more smoothed object surface, yielding higher 3D fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through various comparative qualitative results and a solid user study.

- **Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus. While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses.

- **Summary**: We propose PyTorchGeoNodes, a differentiable module for reconstructing 3D objects from images using interpretable shape programs. In comparison to traditional CAD model retrieval methods, the use of shape programs for 3D reconstruction allows for reasoning about the semantic properties of reconstructed objects, editing, low memory footprint, etc. However, the utilization of shape programs for 3D scene understanding has been largely neglected in past works. As our main contribution, we enable gradient-based optimization by introducing a module that translates shape programs designed in Blender, for example, into efficient PyTorch code. We also provide a method that relies on PyTorchGeoNodes and is inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to jointly optimize discrete and continuous parameters of shape programs and reconstruct 3D objects for input scenes. In our experiments, we apply our algorithm to reconstruct 3D objects in the ScanNet dataset and evaluate our results against CAD model retrieval-based reconstructions. Our experiments indicate that our reconstructions match well the input scenes while enabling semantic reasoning about reconstructed objects.

- **Summary**: NeRF-based 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like EG3D or GIRAFFE have shown very high rendering quality under large representational variety. However, rendering with Neural Radiance Fields poses challenges for 3D applications: First, the significant computational demands of NeRF rendering preclude its use on low-power devices, such as mobiles and VR/AR headsets. Second, implicit representations based on neural networks are difficult to incorporate into explicit 3D scenes, such as VR environments or video games. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes these limitations by providing an explicit 3D representation that can be rendered efficiently at high frame rates. In this work, we present a novel approach that combines the high rendering quality of NeRF-based 3D-aware GANs with the flexibility and computational advantages of 3DGS. By training a decoder that maps implicit NeRF representations to explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting attributes, we can integrate the representational diversity and quality of 3D GANs into the ecosystem of 3D Gaussian Splatting for the first time. Additionally, our approach allows for a high resolution GAN inversion and real-time GAN editing with 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.

- **Summary**: We explore simple methods for adapting a trained multi-task UNet which predicts canopy cover and height to a new geographic setting using remotely sensed data without the need of training a domain-adaptive classifier and extensive fine-tuning. Extending previous research, we followed a selective alignment process to identify similar images in the two geographical domains and then tested an array of data-based unsupervised domain adaptation approaches in a zero-shot setting as well as with a small amount of fine-tuning. We find that the selective aligned data-based image matching methods produce promising results in a zero-shot setting, and even more so with a small amount of fine-tuning. These methods outperform both an untransformed baseline and a popular data-based image-to-image translation model. The best performing methods were pixel distribution adaptation and fourier domain adaptation on the canopy cover and height tasks respectively.

- **Summary**: Despite great improvements in semantic segmentation, challenges persist because of the lack of local/global contexts and the relationship between them. In this paper, we propose Contextrast, a contrastive learning-based semantic segmentation method that allows to capture local/global contexts and comprehend their relationships. Our proposed method comprises two parts: a) contextual contrastive learning (CCL) and b) boundary-aware negative (BANE) sampling. Contextual contrastive learning obtains local/global context from multi-scale feature aggregation and inter/intra-relationship of features for better discrimination capabilities. Meanwhile, BANE sampling selects embedding features along the boundaries of incorrectly predicted regions to employ them as harder negative samples on our contrastive learning, resolving segmentation issues along the boundary region by exploiting fine-grained details. We demonstrate that our Contextrast substantially enhances the performance of semantic segmentation networks, outperforming state-of-the-art contrastive learning approaches on diverse public datasets, e.g. Cityscapes, CamVid, PASCAL-C, COCO-Stuff, and ADE20K, without an increase in computational cost during inference.

- **Summary**: Images captured from the real world are often affected by different types of noise, which can significantly impact the performance of Computer Vision systems and the quality of visual data. This study presents a novel approach for defect detection in casting product noisy images, specifically focusing on submersible pump impellers. The methodology involves utilizing deep learning models such as VGG16, InceptionV3, and other models in both the spatial and frequency domains to identify noise types and defect status. The research process begins with preprocessing images, followed by applying denoising techniques tailored to specific noise categories. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and robustness of defect detection by integrating noise detection and denoising into the classification pipeline. The study achieved remarkable results using VGG16 for noise type classification in the frequency domain, achieving an accuracy of over 99%. Removal of salt and pepper noise resulted in an average SSIM of 87.9, while Gaussian noise removal had an average SSIM of 64.0, and periodic noise removal yielded an average SSIM of 81.6. This comprehensive approach showcases the effectiveness of the deep AutoEncoder model and median filter, for denoising strategies in real-world industrial applications. Finally, our study reports significant improvements in binary classification accuracy for defect detection compared to previous methods. For the VGG16 classifier, accuracy increased from 94.6% to 97.0%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed noise detection and denoising approach. Similarly, for the InceptionV3 classifier, accuracy improved from 84.7% to 90.0%, further validating the benefits of integrating noise analysis into the classification pipeline.

- **Summary**: We introduce VASA, a framework for generating lifelike talking faces with appealing visual affective skills (VAS) given a single static image and a speech audio clip. Our premiere model, VASA-1, is capable of not only producing lip movements that are exquisitely synchronized with the audio, but also capturing a large spectrum of facial nuances and natural head motions that contribute to the perception of authenticity and liveliness. The core innovations include a holistic facial dynamics and head movement generation model that works in a face latent space, and the development of such an expressive and disentangled face latent space using videos. Through extensive experiments including evaluation on a set of new metrics, we show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods along various dimensions comprehensively. Our method not only delivers high video quality with realistic facial and head dynamics but also supports the online generation of 512x512 videos at up to 40 FPS with negligible starting latency. It paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors.

- **Summary**: Creating large-scale virtual urban scenes with variant styles is inherently challenging. To facilitate prototypes of virtual production and bypass the need for complex materials and lighting setups, we introduce the first vision-and-text-driven texture stylization system for large-scale urban scenes, StyleCity. Taking an image and text as references, StyleCity stylizes a 3D textured mesh of a large-scale urban scene in a semantics-aware fashion and generates a harmonic omnidirectional sky background. To achieve that, we propose to stylize a neural texture field by transferring 2D vision-and-text priors to 3D globally and locally. During 3D stylization, we progressively scale the planned training views of the input 3D scene at different levels in order to preserve high-quality scene content. We then optimize the scene style globally by adapting the scale of the style image with the scale of the training views. Moreover, we enhance local semantics consistency by the semantics-aware style loss which is crucial for photo-realistic stylization. Besides texture stylization, we further adopt a generative diffusion model to synthesize a style-consistent omnidirectional sky image, which offers a more immersive atmosphere and assists the semantic stylization process. The stylized neural texture field can be baked into an arbitrary-resolution texture, enabling seamless integration into conventional rendering pipelines and significantly easing the virtual production prototyping process. Extensive experiments demonstrate our stylized scenes' superiority in qualitative and quantitative performance and user preferences.

- **Summary**: We present TeSMo, a method for text-controlled scene-aware motion generation based on denoising diffusion models. Previous text-to-motion methods focus on characters in isolation without considering scenes due to the limited availability of datasets that include motion, text descriptions, and interactive scenes. Our approach begins with pre-training a scene-agnostic text-to-motion diffusion model, emphasizing goal-reaching constraints on large-scale motion-capture datasets. We then enhance this model with a scene-aware component, fine-tuned using data augmented with detailed scene information, including ground plane and object shapes. To facilitate training, we embed annotated navigation and interaction motions within scenes. The proposed method produces realistic and diverse human-object interactions, such as navigation and sitting, in different scenes with various object shapes, orientations, initial body positions, and poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses prior techniques in terms of the plausibility of human-scene interactions, as well as the realism and variety of the generated motions. Code will be released upon publication of this work at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/tesmo.

- **Summary**: Image super-resolution is a fundamentally ill-posed problem because multiple valid high-resolution images exist for one low-resolution image. Super-resolution methods based on diffusion probabilistic models can deal with the ill-posed nature by learning the distribution of high-resolution images conditioned on low-resolution images, avoiding the problem of blurry images in PSNR-oriented methods. However, existing diffusion-based super-resolution methods have high time consumption with the use of iterative sampling, while the quality and consistency of generated images are less than ideal due to problems like color shifting. In this paper, we propose Efficient Conditional Diffusion Model with Probability Flow Sampling (ECDP) for image super-resolution. To reduce the time consumption, we design a continuous-time conditional diffusion model for image super-resolution, which enables the use of probability flow sampling for efficient generation. Additionally, to improve the consistency of generated images, we propose a hybrid parametrization for the denoiser network, which interpolates between the data-predicting parametrization and the noise-predicting parametrization for different noise scales. Moreover, we design an image quality loss as a complement to the score matching loss of diffusion models, further improving the consistency and quality of super-resolution. Extensive experiments on DIV2K, ImageNet, and CelebA demonstrate that our method achieves higher super-resolution quality than existing diffusion-based image super-resolution methods while having lower time consumption.

- **Summary**: Modern smartphone camera quality heavily relies on the image signal processor (ISP) to enhance captured raw images, utilizing carefully designed modules to produce final output images encoded in a standard color space (e.g., sRGB). Neural-based end-to-end learnable ISPs offer promising advancements, potentially replacing traditional ISPs with their ability to adapt without requiring extensive tuning for each new camera model, as is often the case for nearly every module in traditional ISPs. However, the key challenge with the recent learning-based ISPs is the urge to collect large paired datasets for each distinct camera model due to the influence of intrinsic camera characteristics on the formation of input raw images. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel method for unpaired learning of raw-to-raw translation across diverse cameras. Specifically, we propose Rawformer, an unsupervised Transformer-based encoder-decoder method for raw-to-raw translation. It accurately maps raw images captured by a certain camera to the target camera, facilitating the generalization of learnable ISPs to new unseen cameras. Our method demonstrates superior performance on real camera datasets, achieving higher accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art techniques, and preserving a more robust correlation between the original and translated raw images.

- **Summary**: Harnessing visual texts represents a burgeoning frontier in the evolution of language modeling. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-training framework for a suite of pixel-based autoregressive language models, pre-training on a corpus of over 400 million documents rendered as RGB images. Our approach is characterized by a dual-modality training regimen, engaging both visual data through next patch prediction with a regression head and textual data via next token prediction with a classification head. This study is particularly focused on investigating the synergistic interplay between visual and textual modalities of language. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse array of benchmarks reveals that the confluence of visual and textual data substantially augments the efficacy of pixel-based language models. Notably, our findings show that a unidirectional pixel-based model, devoid of textual data during training, can match the performance levels of advanced bidirectional pixel-based models on various language understanding benchmarks. This work highlights the considerable untapped potential of integrating visual and textual information for language modeling purposes. We will release our code, data, and checkpoints to inspire further research advancement.

- **Summary**: Different types of staining highlight different structures in organs, thereby assisting in diagnosis. However, due to the impossibility of repeated staining, we cannot obtain different types of stained slides of the same tissue area. Translating the slide that is easy to obtain (e.g., H&E) to slides of staining types difficult to obtain (e.g., MT, PAS) is a promising way to solve this problem. However, some regions are closely connected to other regions, and to maintain this connection, they often have complex structures and are difficult to translate, which may lead to wrong translations. In this paper, we propose the Attention-Based Varifocal Generative Adversarial Network (AV-GAN), which solves multiple problems in pathologic image translation tasks, such as uneven translation difficulty in different regions, mutual interference of multiple resolution information, and nuclear deformation. Specifically, we develop an Attention-Based Key Region Selection Module, which can attend to regions with higher translation difficulty. We then develop a Varifocal Module to translate these regions at multiple resolutions. Experimental results show that our proposed AV-GAN outperforms existing image translation methods with two virtual kidney tissue staining tasks and improves FID values by 15.9 and 4.16 respectively in the H&E-MT and H&E-PAS tasks.

- **Summary**: While recent image warping approaches achieved remarkable success on existing benchmarks, they still require training separate models for each specific task and cannot generalize well to different camera models or customized manipulations. To address diverse types of warping in practice, we propose a Multiple-in-One image WArping model (named MOWA) in this work. Specifically, we mitigate the difficulty of multi-task learning by disentangling the motion estimation at both the region level and pixel level. To further enable dynamic task-aware image warping, we introduce a lightweight point-based classifier that predicts the task type, serving as prompts to modulate the feature maps for better estimation. To our knowledge, this is the first work that solves multiple practical warping tasks in one single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MOWA, which is trained on six tasks for multiple-in-one image warping, outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models across most tasks. Moreover, MOWA also exhibits promising potential to generalize into unseen scenes, as evidenced by cross-domain and zero-shot evaluations. The code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recently, prototype learning has emerged in semi-supervised medical image segmentation and achieved remarkable performance. However, the scarcity of labeled data limits the expressiveness of prototypes in previous methods, potentially hindering the complete representation of prototypes for class embedding. To address this problem, we propose the Mixed Prototype Consistency Learning (MPCL) framework, which includes a Mean Teacher and an auxiliary network. The Mean Teacher generates prototypes for labeled and unlabeled data, while the auxiliary network produces additional prototypes for mixed data processed by CutMix. Through prototype fusion, mixed prototypes provide extra semantic information to both labeled and unlabeled prototypes. High-quality global prototypes for each class are formed by fusing two enhanced prototypes, optimizing the distribution of hidden embeddings used in consistency learning. Extensive experiments on the left atrium and type B aortic dissection datasets demonstrate MPCL's superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework. The code will be released soon.

- **Summary**: We propose an end-to-end approach for gaze target detection: predicting a head-target connection between individuals and the target image regions they are looking at. Most of the existing methods use independent components such as off-the-shelf head detectors or have problems in establishing associations between heads and gaze targets. In contrast, we investigate an end-to-end multi-person Gaze target detection framework with Heads and Targets Association (GazeHTA), which predicts multiple head-target instances based solely on input scene image. GazeHTA addresses challenges in gaze target detection by (1) leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model to extract scene features for rich semantic understanding, (2) re-injecting a head feature to enhance the head priors for improved head understanding, and (3) learning a connection map as the explicit visual associations between heads and gaze targets. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that GazeHTA outperforms state-of-the-art gaze target detection methods and two adapted diffusion-based baselines on two standard datasets.

- **Summary**: One of the most widely used approaches in continual learning is referred to as replay. Replay methods support interleaved learning by storing past experiences in a replay buffer. Although there are methods for selectively constructing the buffer and reprocessing its contents, there is limited exploration of the problem of selectively retrieving samples from the buffer. Current solutions have been tested in limited settings and, more importantly, in isolation. Existing work has also not explored the impact of duplicate replays on performance. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating selective retrieval strategies, categorized by simple, independent class- and sample-selective primitives. We evaluated several combinations of existing strategies for selective retrieval and present their performances. Furthermore, we propose a set of strategies to prevent duplicate replays and explore whether new samples with low loss values can be learned without replay. In an effort to match our problem setting to a realistic continual learning pipeline, we restrict our experiments to a setting involving a large, pre-trained, open vocabulary object detection model, which is fully fine-tuned on a sequence of 15 datasets.

- **Summary**: Anomaly detection (AD) is often focused on detecting anomaly areas for industrial quality inspection and medical lesion examination. However, due to the specific scenario targets, the data scale for AD is relatively small, and evaluation metrics are still deficient compared to classic vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. To fill these gaps, this work first constructs a large-scale and general-purpose COCO-AD dataset by extending COCO to the AD field. This enables fair evaluation and sustainable development for different methods on this challenging benchmark. Moreover, current metrics such as AU-ROC have nearly reached saturation on simple datasets, which prevents a comprehensive evaluation of different methods. Inspired by the metrics in the segmentation field, we further propose several more practical threshold-dependent AD-specific metrics, ie, m$F_1$$^{.2}_{.8}$, mAcc$^{.2}_{.8}$, mIoU$^{.2}_{.8}$, and mIoU-max. Motivated by GAN inversion's high-quality reconstruction capability, we propose a simple but more powerful InvAD framework to achieve high-quality feature reconstruction. Our method improves the effectiveness of reconstruction-based methods on popular MVTec AD, VisA, and our newly proposed COCO-AD datasets under a multi-class unsupervised setting, where only a single detection model is trained to detect anomalies from different classes. Extensive ablation experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of each component of our InvAD. Full codes and models are available at https://github.com/zhangzjn/ader.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have exhibited remarkable capabilities in text-to-image generation. However, their performance in image-to-text generation, specifically image captioning, has lagged behind Auto-Regressive (AR) models, casting doubt on their applicability for such tasks. In this work, we revisit diffusion models, highlighting their capacity for holistic context modeling and parallel decoding. With these benefits, diffusion models can alleviate the inherent limitations of AR methods, including their slow inference speed, error propagation, and unidirectional constraints. Furthermore, we identify the prior underperformance of diffusion models stemming from the absence of an effective latent space for image-text alignment, and the discrepancy between continuous diffusion processes and discrete textual data. In response, we introduce a novel architecture, LaDiC, which utilizes a split BERT to create a dedicated latent space for captions and integrates a regularization module to manage varying text lengths. Our framework also includes a diffuser for semantic image-to-text conversion and a Back&Refine technique to enhance token interactivity during inference. LaDiC achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffusion-based methods on the MS COCO dataset with 38.2 BLEU@4 and 126.2 CIDEr, demonstrating exceptional performance without pre-training or ancillary modules. This indicates strong competitiveness with AR models, revealing the previously untapped potential of diffusion models in image-to-text generation.

- **Summary**: Neural reconstruction approaches are rapidly emerging as the preferred representation for 3D scenes, but their limited editability is still posing a challenge. In this work, we propose an approach for 3D scene inpainting -- the task of coherently replacing parts of the reconstructed scene with desired content. Scene inpainting is an inherently ill-posed task as there exist many solutions that plausibly replace the missing content. A good inpainting method should therefore not only enable high-quality synthesis but also a high degree of control. Based on this observation, we focus on enabling explicit control over the inpainted content and leverage a reference image as an efficient means to achieve this goal. Specifically, we introduce RefFusion, a novel 3D inpainting method based on a multi-scale personalization of an image inpainting diffusion model to the given reference view. The personalization effectively adapts the prior distribution to the target scene, resulting in a lower variance of score distillation objective and hence significantly sharper details. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results for object removal while maintaining high controllability. We further demonstrate the generality of our formulation on other downstream tasks such as object insertion, scene outpainting, and sparse view reconstruction.

- **Summary**: Two-dimensional (2D) freehand ultrasonography is one of the most commonly used medical imaging modalities, particularly in obstetrics and gynaecology. However, it only captures 2D cross-sectional views of inherently 3D anatomies, losing valuable contextual information. As an alternative to requiring costly and complex 3D ultrasound scanners, 3D volumes can be constructed from 2D scans using machine learning. However this usually requires long computational time. Here, we propose RapidVol: a neural representation framework to speed up slice-to-volume ultrasound reconstruction. We use tensor-rank decomposition, to decompose the typical 3D volume into sets of tri-planes, and store those instead, as well as a small neural network. A set of 2D ultrasound scans, with their ground truth (or estimated) 3D position and orientation (pose) is all that is required to form a complete 3D reconstruction. Reconstructions are formed from real fetal brain scans, and then evaluated by requesting novel cross-sectional views. When compared to prior approaches based on fully implicit representation (e.g. neural radiance fields), our method is over 3x quicker, 46% more accurate, and if given inaccurate poses is more robust. Further speed-up is also possible by reconstructing from a structural prior rather than from scratch.

- **Summary**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis results, while allowing the rendering of high-resolution images in real-time. However, leveraging 3D Gaussians for surface reconstruction poses significant challenges due to the explicit and disconnected nature of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we present Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF), a novel approach for efficient, high-quality, and compact surface reconstruction in unbounded scenes. Our GOF is derived from ray-tracing-based volume rendering of 3D Gaussians, enabling direct geometry extraction from 3D Gaussians by identifying its levelset, without resorting to Poisson reconstruction or TSDF fusion as in previous work. We approximate the surface normal of Gaussians as the normal of the ray-Gaussian intersection plane, enabling the application of regularization that significantly enhances geometry. Furthermore, we develop an efficient geometry extraction method utilizing marching tetrahedra, where the tetrahedral grids are induced from 3D Gaussians and thus adapt to the scene's complexity. Our evaluations reveal that GOF surpasses existing 3DGS-based methods in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Further, it compares favorably to, or even outperforms, neural implicit methods in both quality and speed.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the problem of embodied multi-agent cooperation, where decentralized agents must cooperate given only partial egocentric views of the world. To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. To evaluate the efficacy of our methods, we create two challenging embodied multi-agent long-horizon cooperation tasks using the ThreeDWorld simulator and conduct experiments with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed framework.

- **Summary**: The aim of this work is to establish how accurately a recent semantic-based foveal active perception model is able to complete visual tasks that are regularly performed by humans, namely, scene exploration and visual search. This model exploits the ability of current object detectors to localize and classify a large number of object classes and to update a semantic description of a scene across multiple fixations. It has been used previously in scene exploration tasks. In this paper, we revisit the model and extend its application to visual search tasks. To illustrate the benefits of using semantic information in scene exploration and visual search tasks, we compare its performance against traditional saliency-based models. In the task of scene exploration, the semantic-based method demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional saliency-based model in accurately representing the semantic information present in the visual scene. In visual search experiments, searching for instances of a target class in a visual field containing multiple distractors shows superior performance compared to the saliency-driven model and a random gaze selection algorithm. Our results demonstrate that semantic information, from the top-down, influences visual exploration and search tasks significantly, suggesting a potential area of research for integrating it with traditional bottom-up cues.

- **Summary**: In recent years, pre-trained multimodal large models have attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding performance in various multimodal applications. Nonetheless, the extensive computational resources and vast datasets required for their training present significant hurdles for deployment in environments with limited computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dynamic self-adaptive multiscale distillation from pre-trained multimodal large model for efficient cross-modal representation learning for the first time. Unlike existing distillation methods, our strategy employs a multiscale perspective, enabling the extraction structural knowledge across from the pre-trained multimodal large model. Ensuring that the student model inherits a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the teacher knowledge. To optimize each distillation loss in a balanced and efficient manner, we propose a dynamic self-adaptive distillation loss balancer, a novel component eliminating the need for manual loss weight adjustments and dynamically balances each loss item during the distillation process. Our methodology streamlines pre-trained multimodal large models using only their output features and original image-level information, requiring minimal computational resources. This efficient approach is suited for various applications and allows the deployment of advanced multimodal technologies even in resource-limited settings. Extensive experiments has demonstrated that our method maintains high performance while significantly reducing model complexity and training costs. Moreover, our distilled student model utilizes only image-level information to achieve state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks, surpassing previous methods that relied on region-level information.

- **Summary**: Methane emissions from livestock, particularly cattle, significantly contribute to climate change. Effective methane emission mitigation strategies are crucial as the global population and demand for livestock products increase. We introduce Gasformer, a novel semantic segmentation architecture for detecting low-flow rate methane emissions from livestock, and controlled release experiments using optical gas imaging. We present two unique datasets captured with a FLIR GF77 OGI camera. Gasformer leverages a Mix Vision Transformer encoder and a Light-Ham decoder to generate multi-scale features and refine segmentation maps. Gasformer outperforms other state-of-the-art models on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and segmenting methane plumes in controlled and real-world scenarios. On the livestock dataset, Gasformer achieves mIoU of 88.56%, surpassing other state-of-the-art models. Materials are available at: github.com/toqitahamid/Gasformer.

- **Summary**: The automatic detection of tree-ring boundaries and other anatomical features using image analysis has progressed substantially over the past decade with advances in machine learning and imagery technology, as well as increasing demands from the dendrochronology community. This paper presents a publicly available database of 64 scanned images of transverse sections of commercially grown Pinus taeda trees from northern Uruguay, ranging from 17 to 24 years old. The collection contains several challenging features for automatic ring detection, including illumination and surface preparation variation, fungal infection (blue stains), knot formation, missing cortex or interruptions in outer rings, and radial cracking. This dataset can be used to develop and test automatic tree ring detection algorithms. This paper presents to the dendrochronology community one such method, Cross-Section Tree-Ring Detection (CS-TRD), which identifies and marks complete annual rings in cross-sections for tree species presenting a clear definition between early and latewood. We compare the CS-TRD performance against the ground truth manual delineation of all rings over the UruDendro dataset. The CS-TRD software identified rings with an average F-score of 89% and RMSE error of 5.27px for the entire database in less than 20 seconds per image. Finally, we propose a robust measure of the ring growth using the \emph{equivalent radius} of a circle having the same area enclosed by the detected tree ring. Overall, this study contributes to the dendrochronologist's toolbox of fast and low-cost methods to automatically detect rings in conifer species, particularly for measuring diameter growth rates and stem transverse area using entire cross-sections.

- **Summary**: Large vision-language models revolutionized image classification and semantic segmentation paradigms. However, they typically assume a pre-defined set of categories, or vocabulary, at test time for composing textual prompts. This assumption is impractical in scenarios with unknown or evolving semantic context. Here, we address this issue and introduce the Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC) task, which aims to assign a class from an unconstrained language-induced semantic space to an input image without needing a known vocabulary. VIC is challenging due to the vastness of the semantic space, which contains millions of concepts, including fine-grained categories. To address VIC, we propose Category Search from External Databases (CaSED), a training-free method that leverages a pre-trained vision-language model and an external database. CaSED first extracts the set of candidate categories from the most semantically similar captions in the database and then assigns the image to the best-matching candidate category according to the same vision-language model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CaSED can be applied locally to generate a coarse segmentation mask that classifies image regions, introducing the task of Vocabulary-free Semantic Segmentation. CaSED and its variants outperform other more complex vision-language models, on classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks, while using much fewer parameters.

- **Summary**: An object detector's ability to detect and flag \textit{novel} objects during open-world deployments is critical for many real-world applications. Unfortunately, much of the work in open object detection today is disjointed and fails to adequately address applications that prioritize unknown object recall \textit{in addition to} known-class accuracy. To close this gap, we present a new task called Open-Set Object Detection and Discovery (OSODD) and as a solution propose the Open-Set Regions with ViT features (OSR-ViT) detection framework. OSR-ViT combines a class-agnostic proposal network with a powerful ViT-based classifier. Its modular design simplifies optimization and allows users to easily swap proposal solutions and feature extractors to best suit their application. Using our multifaceted evaluation protocol, we show that OSR-ViT obtains performance levels that far exceed state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our method also excels in low-data settings, outperforming supervised baselines using a fraction of the training data.

- **Summary**: Understanding human motion from video is essential for a range of applications, including pose estimation, mesh recovery and action recognition. While state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, these approaches have limitations in practical scenarios. Transformers are slower when sequentially predicting on a continuous stream of frames in real-time, and do not generalize to new frame rates. In light of these constraints, we propose a novel attention-free spatiotemporal model for human motion understanding building upon recent advancements in state space models. Our model not only matches the performance of transformer-based models in various motion understanding tasks but also brings added benefits like adaptability to different video frame rates and enhanced training speed when working with longer sequence of keypoints. Moreover, the proposed model supports both offline and real-time applications. For real-time sequential prediction, our model is both memory efficient and several times faster than transformer-based approaches while maintaining their high accuracy.

- **Summary**: With the wealth of medical image data, efficient curation is essential. Assigning the sequence type to magnetic resonance images is necessary for scientific studies and artificial intelligence-based analysis. However, incomplete or missing metadata prevents effective automation. We therefore propose a deep-learning method for classification of prostate cancer scanning sequences based on a combination of image data and DICOM metadata. We demonstrate superior results compared to metadata or image data alone, and make our code publicly available at https://github.com/deepakri201/DICOMScanClassification.

- **Summary**: Accurate cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in digital pathology, largely due to the gigapixel size and complex spatial relationships present in whole slide images. Traditional multiple instance learning (MIL) methods often struggle with these intricacies, especially in preserving the necessary context for accurate diagnosis. In response, we introduce a novel framework named Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance (SAG), which includes 1) a technique for converting diagnostically relevant entities into attention signals, and 2) a flexible attention loss that efficiently integrates various semantically significant information, such as tissue anatomy and cancerous regions. Our experiments on two distinct cancer datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall with two state-of-the-art baseline models. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the incorporation of heuristic guidance enables the model to focus on regions critical for diagnosis. SAG is not only effective for the models discussed here, but its adaptability extends to any attention-based diagnostic model. This opens up exciting possibilities for further improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnostics.

- **Summary**: This paper starts with a simple lossless ~1.5:1 compression algorithm for the weights of the Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 7B [1] that can be implemented in ~200 LUTs in AMD FPGAs, processing over 800 million bfloat16 numbers per second. This framework is then extended to variable precision, variable range, compressed numerical data types that are a user defined super set of both floats and posits [2]. The paper then discusses a simple hardware implementation of such format based on ANS (Asymmetrical Numeral Systems) [3] that acts as a bridge between this flexible data format and a computational engine while, at the same time, achieving bandwidth reduction. An example of a token factory using weight compression and sharing is also given.

- **Summary**: Human communication is multi-modal; e.g., face-to-face interaction involves auditory signals (speech) and visual signals (face movements and hand gestures). Hence, it is essential to exploit multiple modalities when designing machine learning-based facial expression recognition systems. In addition, given the ever-growing quantities of video data that capture human facial expressions, such systems should utilize raw unlabeled videos without requiring expensive annotations. Therefore, in this work, we employ a multitask multi-modal self-supervised learning method for facial expression recognition from in-the-wild video data. Our model combines three self-supervised objective functions: First, a multi-modal contrastive loss, that pulls diverse data modalities of the same video together in the representation space. Second, a multi-modal clustering loss that preserves the semantic structure of input data in the representation space. Finally, a multi-modal data reconstruction loss. We conduct a comprehensive study on this multimodal multi-task self-supervised learning method on three facial expression recognition benchmarks. To that end, we examine the performance of learning through different combinations of self-supervised tasks on the facial expression recognition downstream task. Our model ConCluGen outperforms several multi-modal self-supervised and fully supervised baselines on the CMU-MOSEI dataset. Our results generally show that multi-modal self-supervision tasks offer large performance gains for challenging tasks such as facial expression recognition, while also reducing the amount of manual annotations required. We release our pre-trained models as well as source code publicly

- **Summary**: We propose a new tiling strategy, Flip-n-Slide, which has been developed for specific use with large Earth observation satellite images when the location of objects-of-interest (OoI) is unknown and spatial context can be necessary for class disambiguation. Flip-n-Slide is a concise and minimalistic approach that allows OoI to be represented at multiple tile positions and orientations. This strategy introduces multiple views of spatio-contextual information, without introducing redundancies into the training set. By maintaining distinct transformation permutations for each tile overlap, we enhance the generalizability of the training set without misrepresenting the true data distribution. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of Flip-n-Slide in the task of semantic segmentation, a necessary data product in geophysical studies. We find that Flip-n-Slide outperforms the previous state-of-the-art augmentation routines for tiled data in all evaluation metrics. For underrepresented classes, Flip-n-Slide increases precision by as much as 15.8%.

- **Summary**: Moving object segmentation is critical to interpret scene dynamics for robotic navigation systems in challenging environments. Neuromorphic vision sensors are tailored for motion perception due to their asynchronous nature, high temporal resolution, and reduced power consumption. However, their unconventional output requires novel perception paradigms to leverage their spatially sparse and temporally dense nature. In this work, we propose a novel event-based motion segmentation algorithm using a Graph Transformer Neural Network, dubbed GTNN. Our proposed algorithm processes event streams as 3D graphs by a series of nonlinear transformations to unveil local and global spatiotemporal correlations between events. Based on these correlations, events belonging to moving objects are segmented from the background without prior knowledge of the dynamic scene geometry. The algorithm is trained on publicly available datasets including MOD, EV-IMO, and \textcolor{black}{EV-IMO2} using the proposed training scheme to facilitate efficient training on extensive datasets. Moreover, we introduce the Dynamic Object Mask-aware Event Labeling (DOMEL) approach for generating approximate ground-truth labels for event-based motion segmentation datasets. We use DOMEL to label our own recorded Event dataset for Motion Segmentation (EMS-DOMEL), which we release to the public for further research and benchmarking. Rigorous experiments are conducted on several unseen publicly-available datasets where the results revealed that GTNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of dynamic background variations, motion patterns, and multiple dynamic objects with varying sizes and velocities. GTNN achieves significant performance gains with an average increase of 9.4% and 4.5% in terms of motion segmentation accuracy (IoU%) and detection rate (DR%), respectively.

- **Summary**: We demonstrate that adding a weighting factor to decay the strength of identity shortcuts within residual networks substantially improves semantic feature learning in the state-of-the-art self-supervised masked autoencoding (MAE) paradigm. Our modification to the identity shortcuts within a VIT-B/16 backbone of an MAE boosts linear probing accuracy on ImageNet from 67.3% to 72.3%. This significant gap suggests that, while residual connection structure serves an essential role in facilitating gradient propagation, it may have a harmful side effect of reducing capacity for abstract learning by virtue of injecting an echo of shallower representations into deeper layers. We ameliorate this downside via a fixed formula for monotonically decreasing the contribution of identity connections as layer depth increases. Our design promotes the gradual development of feature abstractions, without impacting network trainability. Analyzing the representations learned by our modified residual networks, we find correlation between low effective feature rank and downstream task performance.

- **Summary**: It is well known that training a denoising score-based diffusion models requires tens of thousands of epochs and a substantial number of image data to train the model. In this paper, we propose to increase the efficiency in training score-based diffusion models. Our method allows us to decrease the number of epochs needed to train the diffusion model. We accomplish this by solving the log-density Fokker-Planck (FP) Equation numerically to compute the score \textit{before} training. The pre-computed score is embedded into the image to encourage faster training under slice Wasserstein distance. Consequently, it also allows us to decrease the number of images we need to train the neural network to learn an accurate score. We demonstrate through our numerical experiments the improved performance of our proposed method compared to standard score-based diffusion models. Our proposed method achieves a similar quality to the standard method meaningfully faster.

- **Summary**: Document Presentation Attack Detection (DPAD) is an important measure in protecting the authenticity of a document image. However, recent DPAD methods demand additional resources, such as manual effort in collecting additional data or knowing the parameters of acquisition devices. This work proposes a DPAD method based on multi-modal disentangled traces (MMDT) without the above drawbacks. We first disentangle the recaptured traces by a self-supervised disentanglement and synthesis network to enhance the generalization capacity in document images with different contents and layouts. Then, unlike the existing DPAD approaches that rely only on data in the RGB domain, we propose to explicitly employ the disentangled recaptured traces as new modalities in the transformer backbone through adaptive multi-modal adapters to fuse RGB/trace features efficiently. Visualization of the disentangled traces confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in different document contents. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MMDT method on representing forensic traces of recapturing distortion.

- **Summary**: Robust integration of physical knowledge and data is key to improve computational simulations, such as Earth system models. Data assimilation is crucial for achieving this goal because it provides a systematic framework to calibrate model outputs with observations, which can include remote sensing imagery and ground station measurements, with uncertainty quantification. Conventional methods, including Kalman filters and variational approaches, inherently rely on simplifying linear and Gaussian assumptions, and can be computationally expensive. Nevertheless, with the rapid adoption of data-driven methods in many areas of computational sciences, we see the potential of emulating traditional data assimilation with deep learning, especially generative models. In particular, the diffusion-based probabilistic framework has large overlaps with data assimilation principles: both allows for conditional generation of samples with a Bayesian inverse framework. These models have shown remarkable success in text-conditioned image generation or image-controlled video synthesis. Likewise, one can frame data assimilation as observation-conditioned state calibration. In this work, we propose SLAMS: Score-based Latent Assimilation in Multimodal Setting. Specifically, we assimilate in-situ weather station data and ex-situ satellite imagery to calibrate the vertical temperature profiles, globally. Through extensive ablation, we demonstrate that SLAMS is robust even in low-resolution, noisy, and sparse data settings. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep generative framework for multimodal data assimilation using real-world datasets; an important step for building robust computational simulators, including the next-generation Earth system models.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexual scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block explicit NSFW-related content (e.g., naked or sexy) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate unsafe content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate unsafe visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating unsafe content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.1% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (UVI-ReID) has recently gained great attention due to its potential for enhancing human detection in diverse environments without labeling. Previous methods utilize intra-modality clustering and cross-modality feature matching to achieve UVI-ReID. However, there exist two challenges: 1) noisy pseudo labels might be generated in the clustering process, and 2) the cross-modality feature alignment via matching the marginal distribution of visible and infrared modalities may misalign the different identities from two modalities. In this paper, we first conduct a theoretic analysis where an interpretable generalization upper bound is introduced. Based on the analysis, we then propose a novel unsupervised cross-modality person re-identification framework (PRAISE). Specifically, to address the first challenge, we propose a pseudo-label correction strategy that utilizes a Beta Mixture Model to predict the probability of mis-clustering based network's memory effect and rectifies the correspondence by adding a perceptual term to contrastive learning. Next, we introduce a modality-level alignment strategy that generates paired visible-infrared latent features and reduces the modality gap by aligning the labeling function of visible and infrared features to learn identity discriminative and modality-invariant features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance than the unsupervised visible-ReID methods.

- **Summary**: Previous methods for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) have encountered challenges, notably the manifestation of blur and ghosting effects. These issues can be traced back to two pivotal factors: unavoidable motion errors and misalignment in supervision. In practice, motion estimates often prove to be error-prone, resulting in misaligned features. Furthermore, the reconstruction loss tends to bring blurry results, particularly in misaligned regions. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a new paradigm called PerVFI (Perception-oriented Video Frame Interpolation). Our approach incorporates an Asymmetric Synergistic Blending module (ASB) that utilizes features from both sides to synergistically blend intermediate features. One reference frame emphasizes primary content, while the other contributes complementary information. To impose a stringent constraint on the blending process, we introduce a self-learned sparse quasi-binary mask which effectively mitigates ghosting and blur artifacts in the output. Additionally, we employ a normalizing flow-based generator and utilize the negative log-likelihood loss to learn the conditional distribution of the output, which further facilitates the generation of clear and fine details. Experimental results validate the superiority of PerVFI, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality compared to existing methods.

- **Summary**: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is favored in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise property. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static is violated in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object moving, resulting in ripple-like errors in the point clouds. We propose a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable binomial self-compensation (BSC) algorithm to effectively and flexibly eliminate motion error in the four-step PSP. Our mathematical model demonstrates that by summing successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients, motion error exponentially diminishes as the binomial order increases, accomplishing automatic error compensation through the motion-affected phase sequence, without the assistance of any intermediate variable. Extensive experiments show that our BSC outperforms the existing methods in reducing motion error, while achieving a depth map frame rate equal to the camera's acquisition rate (90 fps), enabling high-accuracy 3D reconstruction with a quasi-single-shot frame rate.

- **Summary**: The emergence of Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection (MC3D-Det), facilitated by bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, signifies a notable progression in 3D object detection. Scaling MC3D-Det training effectively accommodates varied camera parameters and urban landscapes, paving the way for the MC3D-Det foundation model. However, the multi-view fusion stage of the MC3D-Det method relies on the ill-posed monocular perception during training rather than surround refinement ability, leading to what we term "surround refinement degradation". To this end, our study presents a weak-to-strong eliciting framework aimed at enhancing surround refinement while maintaining robust monocular perception. Specifically, our framework employs weakly tuned experts trained on distinct subsets, and each is inherently biased toward specific camera configurations and scenarios. These biased experts can learn the perception of monocular degeneration, which can help the multi-view fusion stage to enhance surround refinement abilities. Moreover, a composite distillation strategy is proposed to integrate the universal knowledge of 2D foundation models and task-specific information. Finally, for MC3D-Det joint training, the elaborate dataset merge strategy is designed to solve the problem of inconsistent camera numbers and camera parameters. We set up a multiple dataset joint training benchmark for MC3D-Det and adequately evaluated existing methods. Further, we demonstrate the proposed framework brings a generalized and significant boost over multiple baselines. Our code is at \url{https://github.com/EnVision-Research/Scale-BEV}.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce a novel Convolution-based Probability Gradient (CPG) loss for semantic segmentation. It employs convolution kernels similar to the Sobel operator, capable of computing the gradient of pixel intensity in an image. This enables the computation of gradients for both ground-truth and predicted category-wise probabilities. It enhances network performance by maximizing the similarity between these two probability gradients. Moreover, to specifically enhance accuracy near the object's boundary, we extract the object boundary based on the ground-truth probability gradient and exclusively apply the CPG loss to pixels belonging to boundaries. CPG loss proves to be highly convenient and effective. It establishes pixel relationships through convolution, calculating errors from a distinct dimension compared to pixel-wise loss functions such as cross-entropy loss. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate the impact of the CPG loss on three well-established networks (DeepLabv3-Resnet50, HRNetV2-OCR, and LRASPP_MobileNet_V3_Large) across three standard segmentation datasets (Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, ADE20K). Our extensive experimental results consistently and significantly demonstrate that the CPG loss enhances the mean Intersection over Union.

- **Summary**: One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images. However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access.

- **Summary**: 3D detection is a critical task that enables machines to identify and locate objects in three-dimensional space. It has a broad range of applications in several fields, including autonomous driving, robotics and augmented reality. Monocular 3D detection is attractive as it requires only a single camera, however, it lacks the accuracy and robustness required for real world applications. High resolution LiDAR on the other hand, can be expensive and lead to interference problems in heavy traffic given their active transmissions. We propose a balanced approach that combines the advantages of monocular and point cloud-based 3D detection. Our method requires only a small number of 3D points, that can be obtained from a low-cost, low-resolution sensor. Specifically, we use only 512 points, which is just 1% of a full LiDAR frame in the KITTI dataset. Our method reconstructs a complete 3D point cloud from this limited 3D information combined with a single image. The reconstructed 3D point cloud and corresponding image can be used by any multi-modal off-the-shelf detector for 3D object detection. By using the proposed network architecture with an off-the-shelf multi-modal 3D detector, the accuracy of 3D detection improves by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art monocular detection methods and 6% to 9% compare to the baseline multi-modal methods on KITTI and JackRabbot datasets.

- **Summary**: We present the Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in geometric volume structures without the need for additional networks, making it adept for challenging observations and uncontrolled images. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by offering an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in relaxing uncertainties by using geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies in interpretation under insufficient real-world observations. Recent research efforts aimed at addressing this issue have primarily relied on empirical methods or auxiliary networks. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a series of formulational extensions to NeRF. By introducing generalized approximations and defining density-related uncertainty, our method seamlessly extends to manage uncertainty not only for RGB but also for depth, without the need for additional networks or empirical assumptions. In experiments we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset, demonstrating the reliability of the Bayesian NeRF approach to quantifying uncertainty based on the geometric structure.

- **Summary**: The study of action recognition has attracted considerable attention recently due to its broad applications in multiple areas. However, with the issue of discontinuous training video, which not only decreases the performance of action recognition model, but complicates the data augmentation process as well, still remains under-exploration. In this study, we introduce the 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach), an innovative pipeline for data augmentation to address the problem. The main contributions remain in our work includes: (1) we investigate the problem of severe decrease on performance of action recognition task training by discontinuous video, and the limitation of existing augmentation methods on solving this problem. (2) we propose a novel augmentation pipeline, 4A, to address the problem of discontinuous video for training, while achieving a smoother and natural-looking action representation than the latest data augmentation methodology. (3) We achieve the same performance with only 10% of the original data for training as with all of the original data from the real-world dataset, and a better performance on In-the-wild videos, by employing our data augmentation techniques.

- **Summary**: Ocean eddies play a significant role both on the sea surface and beneath it, contributing to the sustainability of marine life dependent on oceanic behaviors. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate ocean eddies to monitor changes in the Earth, particularly in the oceans, and their impact on climate. This study aims to pinpoint ocean eddies using AWS cloud services, specifically SageMaker. The primary objective is to detect small-scale (<20km) ocean eddies from satellite remote images and assess the feasibility of utilizing SageMaker, which offers tools for deploying AI applications. Moreover, this research not only explores the deployment of cloud-based services for remote sensing of Earth data but also evaluates several YOLO (You Only Look Once) models using single and multi-GPU-based services in the cloud. Furthermore, this study underscores the potential of these services, their limitations, challenges related to deployment and resource management, and their user-riendliness for Earth science projects.

- **Summary**: Current monocular 3D scene reconstruction (3DR) works are either fully-supervised, or not generalizable, or implicit in 3D representation. We propose a novel framework - MonoSelfRecon that for the first time achieves explicit 3D mesh reconstruction for generalizable indoor scenes with monocular RGB views by purely self-supervision on voxel-SDF (signed distance function). MonoSelfRecon follows an Autoencoder-based architecture, decodes voxel-SDF and a generalizable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is used to guide voxel-SDF in self-supervision. We propose novel self-supervised losses, which not only support pure self-supervision, but can be used together with supervised signals to further boost supervised training. Our experiments show that "MonoSelfRecon" trained in pure self-supervision outperforms current best self-supervised indoor depth estimation models and is comparable to 3DR models trained in fully supervision with depth annotations. MonoSelfRecon is not restricted by specific model design, which can be used to any models with voxel-SDF for purely self-supervised manner.

- **Summary**: This work examines whether decoder-only Transformers such as LLaMA, which were originally designed for large language models (LLMs), can be adapted to the computer vision field. We first "LLaMAfy" a standard ViT step-by-step to align with LLaMA's architecture, and find that directly applying a casual mask to the self-attention brings an attention collapse issue, resulting in the failure to the network training. We suggest to reposition the class token behind the image tokens with a post-sequence class token technique to overcome this challenge, enabling causal self-attention to efficiently capture the entire image's information. Additionally, we develop a soft mask strategy that gradually introduces a casual mask to the self-attention at the onset of training to facilitate the optimization behavior. The tailored model, dubbed as image LLaMA (iLLaMA), is akin to LLaMA in architecture and enables direct supervised learning. Its causal self-attention boosts computational efficiency and learns complex representation by elevating attention map ranks. iLLaMA rivals the performance with its encoder-only counterparts, achieving 75.1% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with only 5.7M parameters. Scaling the model to ~310M and pre-training on ImageNet-21K further enhances the accuracy to 86.0%. Extensive experiments demonstrate iLLaMA's reliable properties: calibration, shape-texture bias, quantization compatibility, ADE20K segmentation and CIFAR transfer learning. We hope our study can kindle fresh views to visual model design in the wave of LLMs. Pre-trained models and codes are available here.

- **Summary**: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed framework for collaborative model training on devices in edge networks. However, challenges arise due to vulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs) and the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data distribution among devices, hindering the deployment of adversarially robust and accurate learning models at the edge. While adversarial training (AT) is commonly acknowledged as an effective defense strategy against adversarial attacks in centralized training, we shed light on the adverse effects of directly applying AT in FL that can severely compromise accuracy, especially in non-IID challenges. Given this limitation, this paper proposes FatCC, which incorporates local logit \underline{C}alibration and global feature \underline{C}ontrast into the vanilla federated adversarial training (\underline{FAT}) process from both logit and feature perspectives. This approach can effectively enhance the federated system's robust accuracy (RA) and clean accuracy (CA). First, we propose logit calibration, where the logits are calibrated during local adversarial updates, thereby improving adversarial robustness. Second, FatCC introduces feature contrast, which involves a global alignment term that aligns each local representation with unbiased global features, thus further enhancing robustness and accuracy in federated adversarial environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FatCC achieves comparable or superior performance gains in both CA and RA compared to other baselines.

- **Summary**: Chinese vector font generation is challenging due to the complex structure and huge amount of Chinese characters. Recent advances remain limited to generating a small set of characters with simple structure. In this work, we first observe that most Chinese characters can be disassembled into frequently-reused components. Therefore, we introduce the first efficient and scalable Chinese vector font generation approach via component composition, allowing generating numerous vector characters from a small set of components. To achieve this, we collect a large-scale dataset that contains over \textit{90K} Chinese characters with their components and layout information. Upon the dataset, we propose a simple yet effective framework based on spatial transformer networks (STN) and multiple losses tailored to font characteristics to learn the affine transformation of the components, which can be directly applied to the B\'ezier curves, resulting in Chinese characters in vector format. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art vector font generation methods in generating large-scale complex Chinese characters in both font generation and zero-shot font extension.

- **Summary**: Text-to-3D generation has achieved remarkable success via large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Nevertheless, there is no paradigm for scaling up the methodology to urban scale. Urban scenes, characterized by numerous elements, intricate arrangement relationships, and vast scale, present a formidable barrier to the interpretability of ambiguous textual descriptions for effective model optimization. In this work, we surmount the limitations by introducing a compositional 3D layout representation into text-to-3D paradigm, serving as an additional prior. It comprises a set of semantic primitives with simple geometric structures and explicit arrangement relationships, complementing textual descriptions and enabling steerable generation. Upon this, we propose two modifications -- (1) We introduce Layout-Guided Variational Score Distillation to address model optimization inadequacies. It conditions the score distillation sampling process with geometric and semantic constraints of 3D layouts. (2) To handle the unbounded nature of urban scenes, we represent 3D scene with a Scalable Hash Grid structure, incrementally adapting to the growing scale of urban scenes. Extensive experiments substantiate the capability of our framework to scale text-to-3D generation to large-scale urban scenes that cover over 1000m driving distance for the first time. We also present various scene editing demonstrations, showing the powers of steerable urban scene generation. Website: https://urbanarchitect.github.io.

- **Summary**: Medical Report Grounding is pivotal in identifying the most relevant regions in medical images based on a given phrase query, a critical aspect in medical image analysis and radiological diagnosis. However, prevailing visual grounding approaches necessitate the manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, imposing substantial burdens on both system efficiency and physicians. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Medical Report Grounding (MedRG), an end-to-end solution for utilizing a multi-modal Large Language Model to predict key phrase by incorporating a unique token, BOX, into the vocabulary to serve as an embedding for unlocking detection capabilities. Subsequently, the vision encoder-decoder jointly decodes the hidden embedding and the input medical image, generating the corresponding grounding box. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of MedRG, surpassing the performance of the existing state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the medical report grounding task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain.

- **Summary**: 3D point cloud completion is designed to recover complete shapes from partially observed point clouds. Conventional completion methods typically depend on extensive point cloud data for training %, with their effectiveness often constrained to object categories similar to those seen during training. In contrast, we propose a zero-shot framework aimed at completing partially observed point clouds across any unseen categories. Leveraging point rendering via Gaussian Splatting, we develop techniques of Point Cloud Colorization and Zero-shot Fractal Completion that utilize 2D priors from pre-trained diffusion models to infer missing regions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scanned point clouds demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in completing a variety of objects without any requirement for specific training data.

- **Summary**: Detecting anomalies in images has become a well-explored problem in both academia and industry. State-of-the-art algorithms are able to detect defects in increasingly difficult settings and data modalities. However, most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed, they suffer from excessive computation requirements, which hinder real-world usability. For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set.

- **Summary**: In this work, we target the task of text-driven style transfer in the context of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The main challenge is consistent structure preservation while enabling effective style transfer effects. The past approaches in this field directly concatenate the content and style prompts for a prompt-level style injection, leading to unavoidable structure distortions. In this work, we propose a novel solution to the text-driven style transfer task, namely, Adaptive Style Incorporation~(ASI), to achieve fine-grained feature-level style incorporation. It consists of the Siamese Cross-Attention~(SiCA) to decouple the single-track cross-attention to a dual-track structure to obtain separate content and style features, and the Adaptive Content-Style Blending (AdaBlending) module to couple the content and style information from a structure-consistent manner. Experimentally, our method exhibits much better performance in both structure preservation and stylized effects.

- **Summary**: Online construction of open-ended language scenes is crucial for robotic applications, where open-vocabulary interactive scene understanding is required. Recently, neural implicit representation has provided a promising direction for online interactive mapping. However, implementing open-vocabulary scene understanding capability into online neural implicit mapping still faces three challenges: lack of local scene updating ability, blurry spatial hierarchical semantic segmentation and difficulty in maintaining multi-view consistency. To this end, we proposed O2V-mapping, which utilizes voxel-based language and geometric features to create an open-vocabulary field, thus allowing for local updates during online training process. Additionally, we leverage a foundational model for image segmentation to extract language features on object-level entities, achieving clear segmentation boundaries and hierarchical semantic features. For the purpose of preserving consistency in 3D object properties across different viewpoints, we propose a spatial adaptive voxel adjustment mechanism and a multi-view weight selection method. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that O2V-mapping achieves online construction of language scenes while enhancing accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA method.

- **Summary**: Learning-based stereo matching techniques have made significant progress. However, existing methods inevitably lose geometrical structure information during the feature channel generation process, resulting in edge detail mismatches. In this paper, the Motif Cha}nnel Attention Stereo Matching Network (MoCha-Stereo) is designed to address this problem. We provide the Motif Channel Correlation Volume (MCCV) to determine more accurate edge matching costs. MCCV is achieved by projecting motif channels, which capture common geometric structures in feature channels, onto feature maps and cost volumes. In addition, edge variations in %potential feature channels of the reconstruction error map also affect details matching, we propose the Reconstruction Error Motif Penalty (REMP) module to further refine the full-resolution disparity estimation. REMP integrates the frequency information of typical channel features from the reconstruction error. MoCha-Stereo ranks 1st on the KITTI-2015 and KITTI-2012 Reflective leaderboards. Our structure also shows excellent performance in Multi-View Stereo. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/ZYangChen/MoCha-Stereo.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have shown remarkable results for image generation, editing and inpainting. Recent works explore diffusion models for 3D shape generation with neural implicit functions, i.e., signed distance function and occupancy function. However, they are limited to shapes with closed surfaces, which prevents them from generating diverse 3D real-world contents containing open surfaces. In this work, we present UDiFF, a 3D diffusion model for unsigned distance fields (UDFs) which is capable to generate textured 3D shapes with open surfaces from text conditions or unconditionally. Our key idea is to generate UDFs in spatial-frequency domain with an optimal wavelet transformation, which produces a compact representation space for UDF generation. Specifically, instead of selecting an appropriate wavelet transformation which requires expensive manual efforts and still leads to large information loss, we propose a data-driven approach to learn the optimal wavelet transformation for UDFs. We evaluate UDiFF to show our advantages by numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods on widely used benchmarks. Page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/UDiFF.

- **Summary**: Multi-label image classification in dynamic environments is a problem that poses significant challenges. Previous studies have primarily focused on scenarios such as Domain Incremental Learning and Class Incremental Learning, which do not fully capture the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we study the problem of classification of medical imaging in the scenario termed New Instances and New Classes, which combines the challenges of both new class arrivals and domain shifts in a single framework. Unlike traditional scenarios, it reflects the realistic nature of CL in domains such as medical imaging, where updates may introduce both new classes and changes in domain characteristics. To address the unique challenges posed by this complex scenario, we introduce a novel approach called Pseudo-Label Replay. This method aims to mitigate forgetting while adapting to new classes and domain shifts by combining the advantages of the Replay and Pseudo-Label methods and solving their limitations in the proposed scenario. We evaluate our proposed approach on a challenging benchmark consisting of two datasets, seven tasks, and nineteen classes, modeling a realistic Continual Learning scenario. Our experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of Pseudo-Label Replay in addressing the challenges posed by the complex scenario proposed. Our method surpasses existing approaches, exhibiting superior performance while showing minimal forgetting.

- **Summary**: 3D lane detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by extracting structural and traffic information from the road in 3D space to assist the self-driving car in rational, safe, and comfortable path planning and motion control. Due to the consideration of sensor costs and the advantages of visual data in color information, in practical applications, 3D lane detection based on monocular vision is one of the important research directions in the field of autonomous driving, which has attracted more and more attention in both industry and academia. Unfortunately, recent progress in visual perception seems insufficient to develop completely reliable 3D lane detection algorithms, which also hinders the development of vision-based fully autonomous self-driving cars, i.e., achieving level 5 autonomous driving, driving like human-controlled cars. This is one of the conclusions drawn from this review paper: there is still a lot of room for improvement and significant improvements are still needed in the 3D lane detection algorithm for autonomous driving cars using visual sensors. Motivated by this, this review defines, analyzes, and reviews the current achievements in the field of 3D lane detection research, and the vast majority of the current progress relies heavily on computationally complex deep learning models. In addition, this review covers the 3D lane detection pipeline, investigates the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms, analyzes the time complexity of cutting-edge modeling choices, and highlights the main achievements and limitations of current research efforts. The survey also includes a comprehensive discussion of available 3D lane detection datasets and the challenges that researchers have faced but have not yet resolved. Finally, our work outlines future research directions and welcomes researchers and practitioners to enter this exciting field.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated outstanding results in numerous domains, some important functionalities are missing. Resolution scalability is one of them. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture, dubbed RESSCAL3D, providing resolution-scalable 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds. In contrast to existing works, the proposed method does not require the whole point cloud to be available to start inference. Once a low-resolution version of the input point cloud is available, first semantic predictions can be generated in an extremely fast manner. This enables early decision-making in subsequent processing steps. As additional points become available, these are processed in parallel. To improve performance, features from previously computed scales are employed as prior knowledge at the current scale. Our experiments show that RESSCAL3D is 31-62% faster than the non-scalable baseline while keeping a limited impact on performance. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to propose a resolution-scalable approach for 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds based on deep learning.

- **Summary**: This study addresses the challenge of, without training or fine-tuning, controlling the global color aspect of images generated with a diffusion model. We rewrite the guidance equations to ensure that the outputs are closer to a known color map, and this without hindering the quality of the generation. Our method leads to new guidance equations. We show in the color guidance context that, the scaling of the guidance should not decrease but remains high throughout the diffusion process. In a second contribution, our guidance is applied in a compression framework, we combine both semantic and general color information on the image to decode the images at low cost. We show that our method is effective at improving fidelity and realism of compressed images at extremely low bit rates, when compared to other classical or more semantic oriented approaches.

- **Summary**: End-to-End paradigms use a unified framework to implement multi-tasks in an autonomous driving system. Despite simplicity and clarity, the performance of end-to-end autonomous driving methods on sub-tasks is still far behind the single-task methods. Meanwhile, the widely used dense BEV features in previous end-to-end methods make it costly to extend to more modalities or tasks. In this paper, we propose a Sparse query-centric paradigm for end-to-end Autonomous Driving (SparseAD), where the sparse queries completely represent the whole driving scenario across space, time and tasks without any dense BEV representation. Concretely, we design a unified sparse architecture for perception tasks including detection, tracking, and online mapping. Moreover, we revisit motion prediction and planning, and devise a more justifiable motion planner framework. On the challenging nuScenes dataset, SparseAD achieves SOTA full-task performance among end-to-end methods and significantly narrows the performance gap between end-to-end paradigms and single-task methods. Codes will be released soon.

- **Summary**: Online temporal action segmentation shows a strong potential to facilitate many HRI tasks where extended human action sequences must be tracked and understood in real time. Traditional action segmentation approaches, however, operate in an offline two stage approach, relying on computationally expensive video wide features for segmentation, rendering them unsuitable for online HRI applications. In order to facilitate online action segmentation on a stream of incoming video data, we introduce two methods for improved training and inference of backbone action recognition models, allowing them to be deployed directly for online frame level classification. Firstly, we introduce surround dense sampling whilst training to facilitate training vs. inference clip matching and improve segment boundary predictions. Secondly, we introduce an Online Temporally Aware Label Cleaning (O-TALC) strategy to explicitly reduce oversegmentation during online inference. As our methods are backbone invariant, they can be deployed with computationally efficient spatio-temporal action recognition models capable of operating in real time with a small segmentation latency. We show our method outperforms similar online action segmentation work as well as matches the performance of many offline models with access to full temporal resolution when operating on challenging fine-grained datasets.

- **Summary**: The increasing demand for virtual reality applications has highlighted the significance of crafting immersive 3D assets. We present a text-to-3D 360$^{\circ}$ scene generation pipeline that facilitates the creation of comprehensive 360$^{\circ}$ scenes for in-the-wild environments in a matter of minutes. Our approach utilizes the generative power of a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality and globally coherent panoramic image. This image acts as a preliminary "flat" (2D) scene representation. Subsequently, it is lifted into 3D Gaussians, employing splatting techniques to enable real-time exploration. To produce consistent 3D geometry, our pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud. This point cloud serves as the initial state for the centroids of 3D Gaussians. In order to address invisible issues inherent in single-view inputs, we impose semantic and geometric constraints on both synthesized and input camera views as regularizations. These guide the optimization of Gaussians, aiding in the reconstruction of unseen regions. In summary, our method offers a globally consistent 3D scene within a 360$^{\circ}$ perspective, providing an enhanced immersive experience over existing techniques.

- **Summary**: Large motion poses a critical challenge in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) task. Existing methods are often constrained by limited receptive fields, resulting in sub-optimal performance when handling scenarios with large motion. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline for VFI, which can effectively integrate global-level information to alleviate issues associated with large motion. Specifically, we first estimate a pair of initial intermediate flows using a high-resolution feature map for extracting local details. Then, we incorporate a sparse global matching branch to compensate for flow estimation, which consists of identifying flaws in initial flows and generating sparse flow compensation with a global receptive field. Finally, we adaptively merge the initial flow estimation with global flow compensation, yielding a more accurate intermediate flow. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in handling large motion, we carefully curate a more challenging subset from commonly used benchmarks. Our method demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on these VFI subsets with large motion.

- **Summary**: Leveraging vast training data, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated formidable general visual comprehension capabilities and achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, their performance in visual document understanding still leaves much room for improvement. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the fact that visual document understanding is a fine-grained prediction task. In natural scenes, MLLMs typically use low-resolution images, leading to a substantial loss of visual information. Furthermore, general-purpose MLLMs do not excel in handling document-oriented instructions. In this paper, we propose a High-Resolution Visual Document Assistant (HRVDA), which bridges the gap between MLLMs and visual document understanding. This model employs a content filtering mechanism and an instruction filtering module to separately filter out the content-agnostic visual tokens and instruction-agnostic visual tokens, thereby achieving efficient model training and inference for high-resolution images. In addition, we construct a document-oriented visual instruction tuning dataset and apply a multi-stage training strategy to enhance the model's document modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple document understanding datasets, while maintaining training efficiency and inference speed comparable to low-resolution models.

- **Summary**: The past several years have witnessed the emergence of learned point cloud compression (PCC) techniques. However, current learning-based lossless point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) methods either suffer from high computational complexity or deteriorated compression performance. Moreover, the significant variations in point cloud scale and sparsity encountered in real-world applications make developing an all-in-one neural model a challenging task. In this paper, we propose PoLoPCAC, an efficient and generic lossless PCAC method that achieves high compression efficiency and strong generalizability simultaneously. We formulate lossless PCAC as the task of inferring explicit distributions of attributes from group-wise autoregressive priors. A progressive random grouping strategy is first devised to efficiently resolve the point cloud into groups, and then the attributes of each group are modeled sequentially from accumulated antecedents. A locality-aware attention mechanism is utilized to exploit prior knowledge from context windows in parallel. Since our method directly operates on points, it can naturally avoids distortion caused by voxelization, and can be executed on point clouds with arbitrary scale and density. Experiments show that our method can be instantly deployed once trained on a Synthetic 2k-ShapeNet dataset while enjoying continuous bit-rate reduction over the latest G-PCCv23 on various datasets (ShapeNet, ScanNet, MVUB, 8iVFB). Meanwhile, our method reports shorter coding time than G-PCCv23 on the majority of sequences with a lightweight model size (2.6MB), which is highly attractive for practical applications. Dataset, code and trained model are available at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/PoLoPCAC.

- **Summary**: Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is recognised as the benchmark modality for the comprehensive assessment of cardiac function. Nevertheless, the acquisition process of cine CMR is considered as an impediment due to its prolonged scanning time. One commonly used strategy to expedite the acquisition process is through k-space undersampling, though it comes with a drawback of introducing aliasing effects in the reconstructed image. Lately, deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable results over traditional approaches in rapidly achieving precise CMR reconstructed images. This study aims to explore the untapped potential of attention mechanisms incorporated with a deep learning model within the context of the CMR reconstruction problem. We are motivated by the fact that attention has proven beneficial in downstream tasks such as image classification and segmentation, but has not been systematically analysed in the context of CMR reconstruction. Our primary goal is to identify the strengths and potential limitations of attention algorithms when integrated with a convolutional backbone model such as a U-Net. To achieve this, we benchmark different state-of-the-art spatial and channel attention mechanisms on the CMRxRecon dataset and quantitatively evaluate the quality of reconstruction using objective metrics. Furthermore, inspired by the best performing attention mechanism, we propose a new, simple yet effective, attention pipeline specifically optimised for the task of cardiac image reconstruction that outperforms other state-of-the-art attention methods. The layer and model code will be made publicly available.

- **Summary**: Recently, the area of adversarial attacks on image quality metrics has begun to be explored, whereas the area of defences remains under-researched. In this study, we aim to cover that case and check the transferability of adversarial purification defences from image classifiers to IQA methods. In this paper, we apply several widespread attacks on IQA models and examine the success of the defences against them. The purification methodologies covered different preprocessing techniques, including geometrical transformations, compression, denoising, and modern neural network-based methods. Also, we address the challenge of assessing the efficacy of a defensive methodology by proposing ways to estimate output visual quality and the success of neutralizing attacks. Defences were tested against attack on three IQA metrics -- Linearity, MetaIQA and SPAQ. The code for attacks and defences is available at: (link is hidden for a blind review).

- **Summary**: In response to the rising threat of the face morphing attack, this paper introduces and explores the potential of Video-based Morphing Attack Detection (V-MAD) systems in real-world operational scenarios. While current morphing attack detection methods primarily focus on a single or a pair of images, V-MAD is based on video sequences, exploiting the video streams often acquired by face verification tools available, for instance, at airport gates. Through this study, we show for the first time the advantages that the availability of multiple probe frames can bring to the morphing attack detection task, especially in scenarios where the quality of probe images is varied and might be affected, for instance, by pose or illumination variations. Experimental results on a real operational database demonstrate that video sequences represent valuable information for increasing the robustness and performance of morphing attack detection systems.

- **Summary**: Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.

- **Summary**: Typically, tennis court line detection is done by running Hough-Line-Detection to find straight lines in the image, and then computing a transformation matrix from the detected lines to create the final court structure. We propose numerous improvements and enhancements to this algorithm, including using pretrained State-of-the-Art shadow-removal and object-detection ML models to make our line-detection more robust. Compared to the original algorithm, our method can accurately detect lines on amateur, dirty courts. When combined with a robust ball-tracking system, our method will enable accurate, automatic refereeing for amateur and professional tennis matches alike.

- **Summary**: In spectral CT reconstruction, the basis materials decomposition involves solving a large-scale nonlinear system of integral equations, which is highly ill-posed mathematically. This paper proposes a model that parameterizes the attenuation coefficients of the object using a neural field representation, thereby avoiding the complex calculations of pixel-driven projection coefficient matrices during the discretization process of line integrals. It introduces a lightweight discretization method for line integrals based on a ray-driven neural field, enhancing the accuracy of the integral approximation during the discretization process. The basis materials are represented as continuous vector-valued implicit functions to establish a neural field parameterization model for the basis materials. The auto-differentiation framework of deep learning is then used to solve the implicit continuous function of the neural base-material fields. This method is not limited by the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, and the network has compact and regular properties. Experimental validation shows that our method performs exceptionally well in addressing the spectral CT reconstruction. Additionally, it fulfils the requirements for the generation of high-resolution reconstruction images.

- **Summary**: Fractional Brownian trajectories (fBm) feature both randomness and strong scale-free correlations, challenging generative models to reproduce the intrinsic memory characterizing the underlying process. Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

- **Summary**: Every day, countless surgeries are performed worldwide, each within the distinct settings of operating rooms (ORs) that vary not only in their setups but also in the personnel, tools, and equipment used. This inherent diversity poses a substantial challenge for achieving a holistic understanding of the OR, as it requires models to generalize beyond their initial training datasets. To reduce this gap, we introduce ORacle, an advanced vision-language model designed for holistic OR domain modeling, which incorporates multi-view and temporal capabilities and can leverage external knowledge during inference, enabling it to adapt to previously unseen surgical scenarios. This capability is further enhanced by our novel data augmentation framework, which significantly diversifies the training dataset, ensuring ORacle's proficiency in applying the provided knowledge effectively. In rigorous testing, in scene graph generation, and downstream tasks on the 4D-OR dataset, ORacle not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance but does so requiring less data than existing models. Furthermore, its adaptability is displayed through its ability to interpret unseen views, actions, and appearances of tools and equipment. This demonstrates ORacle's potential to significantly enhance the scalability and affordability of OR domain modeling and opens a pathway for future advancements in surgical data science. We will release our code and data upon acceptance.

- **Summary**: Semi-supervised segmentation presents a promising approach for large-scale medical image analysis, effectively reducing annotation burdens while achieving comparable performance. This methodology holds substantial potential for streamlining the segmentation process and enhancing its feasibility within clinical settings for translational investigations. While cross-supervised training, based on distinct co-training sub-networks, has become a prevalent paradigm for this task, addressing critical issues such as predication disagreement and label-noise suppression requires further attention and progress in cross-supervised training. In this paper, we introduce an Evidential Tri-Branch Consistency learning framework (ETC-Net) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. ETC-Net employs three branches: an evidential conservative branch, an evidential progressive branch, and an evidential fusion branch. The first two branches exhibit complementary characteristics, allowing them to address prediction diversity and enhance training stability. We also integrate uncertainty estimation from the evidential learning into cross-supervised training, mitigating the negative impact of erroneous supervision signals. Additionally, the evidential fusion branch capitalizes on the complementary attributes of the first two branches and leverages an evidence-based Dempster-Shafer fusion strategy, supervised by more reliable and accurate pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments conducted on LA, Pancreas-CT, and ACDC datasets demonstrate that ETC-Net surpasses other state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised segmentation. The code will be made available in the near future at https://github.com/Medsemiseg.

- **Summary**: Many safety-critical applications, especially in autonomous driving, require reliable object detectors. They can be very effectively assisted by a method to search for and identify potential failures and systematic errors before these detectors are deployed. Systematic errors are characterized by combinations of attributes such as object location, scale, orientation, and color, as well as the composition of their respective backgrounds. To identify them, one must rely on something other than real images from a test set because they do not account for very rare but possible combinations of attributes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a pipeline for generating realistic synthetic scenes with fine-grained control, allowing the creation of complex scenes with multiple objects. Our approach, BEV2EGO, allows for a realistic generation of the complete scene with road-contingent control that maps 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) scene configurations to a first-person view (EGO). In addition, we propose a benchmark for controlled scene generation to select the most appropriate generative outpainting model for BEV2EGO. We further use it to perform a systematic analysis of multiple state-of-the-art object detection models and discover differences between them.

- **Summary**: In the field of computer vision, visible light images often exhibit low contrast in low-light conditions, presenting a significant challenge. While infrared imagery provides a potential solution, its utilization entails high costs and practical limitations. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly the deployment of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have facilitated the transformation of visible light images to infrared images. However, these methods often experience unstable training phases and may produce suboptimal outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end Transformer-based model that efficiently converts visible light images into high-fidelity infrared images. Initially, the Texture Mapping Module and Color Perception Adapter collaborate to extract texture and color features from the visible light image. The Dynamic Fusion Aggregation Module subsequently integrates these features. Finally, the transformation into an infrared image is refined through the synergistic action of the Color Perception Adapter and the Enhanced Perception Attention mechanism. Comprehensive benchmarking experiments confirm that our model outperforms existing methods, producing infrared images of markedly superior quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the proposed model enables more effective downstream applications for infrared images than other methods.

- **Summary**: Recognising emotions in context involves identifying the apparent emotions of an individual, taking into account contextual cues from the surrounding scene. Previous approaches to this task have involved the design of explicit scene-encoding architectures or the incorporation of external scene-related information, such as captions. However, these methods often utilise limited contextual information or rely on intricate training pipelines. In this work, we leverage the groundbreaking capabilities of Vision-and-Large-Language Models (VLLMs) to enhance in-context emotion classification without introducing complexity to the training process in a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we propose prompting VLLMs to generate descriptions in natural language of the subject's apparent emotion relative to the visual context. In the second stage, the descriptions are used as contextual information and, along with the image input, are used to train a transformer-based architecture that fuses text and visual features before the final classification task. Our experimental results show that the text and image features have complementary information, and our fused architecture significantly outperforms the individual modalities without any complex training methods. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, namely, EMOTIC, CAER-S, and BoLD, and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable accuracy across all datasets and metrics compared to much more complex approaches.

- **Summary**: This paper presents Key2Mesh, a model that takes a set of 2D human pose keypoints as input and estimates the corresponding body mesh. Since this process does not involve any visual (i.e. RGB image) data, the model can be trained on large-scale motion capture (MoCap) datasets, thereby overcoming the scarcity of image datasets with 3D labels. To enable the model's application on RGB images, we first run an off-the-shelf 2D pose estimator to obtain the 2D keypoints, and then feed these 2D keypoints to Key2Mesh. To improve the performance of our model on RGB images, we apply an adversarial domain adaptation (DA) method to bridge the gap between the MoCap and visual domains. Crucially, our DA method does not require 3D labels for visual data, which enables adaptation to target sets without the need for costly labels. We evaluate Key2Mesh for the task of estimating 3D human meshes from 2D keypoints, in the absence of RGB and mesh label pairs. Our results on widely used H3.6M and 3DPW datasets show that Key2Mesh sets the new state-of-the-art by outperforming other models in PA-MPJPE for both datasets, and in MPJPE and PVE for the 3DPW dataset. Thanks to our model's simple architecture, it operates at least 12x faster than the prior state-of-the-art model, LGD. Additional qualitative samples and code are available on the project website: https://key2mesh.github.io/.

- **Summary**: We tackle the long-standing challenge of reconstructing 3D structures and camera positions from videos. The problem is particularly hard when objects are transformed in a non-rigid way. Current approaches to this problem make unrealistic assumptions or require a long optimization time.   We present TracksTo4D, a novel deep learning-based approach that enables inferring 3D structure and camera positions from dynamic content originating from in-the-wild videos using a single feed-forward pass on a sparse point track matrix. To achieve this, we leverage recent advances in 2D point tracking and design an equivariant neural architecture tailored for directly processing 2D point tracks by leveraging their symmetries. TracksTo4D is trained on a dataset of in-the-wild videos utilizing only the 2D point tracks extracted from the videos, without any 3D supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that TracksTo4D generalizes well to unseen videos of unseen semantic categories at inference time, producing equivalent results to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the runtime compared to other baselines.

- **Summary**: Point cloud completion aims to generate a complete and high-fidelity point cloud from an initially incomplete and low-quality input. A prevalent strategy involves leveraging Transformer-based models to encode global features and facilitate the reconstruction process. However, the adoption of pooling operations to obtain global feature representations often results in the loss of local details within the point cloud. Moreover, the attention mechanism inherent in Transformers introduces additional computational complexity, rendering it challenging to handle long sequences effectively. To address these issues, we propose 3DMambaComplete, a point cloud completion network built on the novel Mamba framework. It comprises three modules: HyperPoint Generation encodes point cloud features using Mamba's selection mechanism and predicts a set of Hyperpoints. A specific offset is estimated, and the down-sampled points become HyperPoints. The HyperPoint Spread module disperses these HyperPoints across different spatial locations to avoid concentration. Finally, a deformation method transforms the 2D mesh representation of HyperPoints into a fine-grained 3D structure for point cloud reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on various established benchmarks demonstrate that 3DMambaComplete surpasses state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods, as confirmed by qualitative and quantitative analyses.

- **Summary**: Natural environments such as forests and grasslands are challenging for robotic navigation because of the false perception of rigid obstacles from high grass, twigs, or bushes. In this work, we present Wild Visual Navigation (WVN), an online self-supervised learning system for visual traversability estimation. The system is able to continuously adapt from a short human demonstration in the field, only using onboard sensing and computing. One of the key ideas to achieve this is the use of high-dimensional features from pre-trained self-supervised models, which implicitly encode semantic information that massively simplifies the learning task. Further, the development of an online scheme for supervision generator enables concurrent training and inference of the learned model in the wild. We demonstrate our approach through diverse real-world deployments in forests, parks, and grasslands. Our system is able to bootstrap the traversable terrain segmentation in less than 5 min of in-field training time, enabling the robot to navigate in complex, previously unseen outdoor terrains.

- **Summary**: Deep subspace clustering methods are now prominent in clustering, typically using fully connected networks and a self-representation loss function. However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel method to estimate a driver's points-of-gaze using a pair of ordinary cameras mounted on the windshield and dashboard of a car. This is a challenging problem due to the dynamics of traffic environments with 3D scenes of unknown depths. This problem is further complicated by the volatile distance between the driver and the camera system. To tackle these challenges, we develop a novel convolutional network that simultaneously analyzes the image of the scene and the image of the driver's face. This network has a camera calibration module that can compute an embedding vector that represents the spatial configuration between the driver and the camera system. This calibration module improves the overall network's performance, which can be jointly trained end to end.   We also address the lack of annotated data for training and evaluation by introducing a large-scale driving dataset with point-of-gaze annotations. This is an in situ dataset of real driving sessions in an urban city, containing synchronized images of the driving scene as well as the face and gaze of the driver. Experiments on this dataset show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, having the mean prediction error of 29.69 pixels, which is relatively small compared to the $1280{\times}720$ resolution of the scene camera.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel pipeline designed to bring ultrasound (US) plane pose estimation closer to clinical use for more effective navigation to the standard planes (SPs) in the fetal brain. We propose a semi-supervised segmentation model utilizing both labeled SPs and unlabeled 3D US volume slices. Our model enables reliable segmentation across a diverse set of fetal brain images. Furthermore, the model incorporates a classification mechanism to identify the fetal brain precisely. Our model not only filters out frames lacking the brain but also generates masks for those containing it, enhancing the relevance of plane pose regression in clinical settings. We focus on fetal brain navigation from 2D ultrasound (US) video analysis and combine this model with a US plane pose regression network to provide sensorless proximity detection to SPs and non-SPs planes; we emphasize the importance of proximity detection to SPs for guiding sonographers, offering a substantial advantage over traditional methods by allowing earlier and more precise adjustments during scanning. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through validation on real fetal scan videos obtained from sonographers of varying expertise levels. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to complement existing fetal US technologies and advance prenatal diagnostic practices.

- **Summary**: Deep neural networks that achieve remarkable performance in image classification have previously been shown to be easily fooled by tiny transformations such as a one pixel translation of the input image. In order to address this problem, two approaches have been proposed in recent years. The first approach suggests using huge datasets together with data augmentation in the hope that a highly varied training set will teach the network to learn to be invariant. The second approach suggests using architectural modifications based on sampling theory to deal explicitly with image translations. In this paper, we show that these approaches still fall short in robustly handling 'natural' image translations that simulate a subtle change in camera orientation. Our findings reveal that a mere one-pixel translation can result in a significant change in the predicted image representation for approximately 40% of the test images in state-of-the-art models (e.g. open-CLIP trained on LAION-2B or DINO-v2) , while models that are explicitly constructed to be robust to cyclic translations can still be fooled with 1 pixel realistic (non-cyclic) translations 11% of the time. We present Robust Inference by Crop Selection: a simple method that can be proven to achieve any desired level of consistency, although with a modest tradeoff with the model's accuracy. Importantly, we demonstrate how employing this method reduces the ability to fool state-of-the-art models with a 1 pixel translation to less than 5% while suffering from only a 1% drop in classification accuracy. Additionally, we show that our method can be easy adjusted to deal with circular shifts as well. In such case we achieve 100% robustness to integer shifts with state-of-the-art accuracy, and with no need for any further training.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Unified Language-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation (ULDA), a novel task setting that enables a single model to adapt to diverse target domains without explicit domain-ID knowledge. We identify the constraints in the existing language-driven zero-shot domain adaptation task, particularly the requirement for domain IDs and domain-specific models, which may restrict flexibility and scalability. To overcome these issues, we propose a new framework for ULDA, consisting of Hierarchical Context Alignment (HCA), Domain Consistent Representation Learning (DCRL), and Text-Driven Rectifier (TDR). These components work synergistically to align simulated features with target text across multiple visual levels, retain semantic correlations between different regional representations, and rectify biases between simulated and real target visual features, respectively. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that this framework achieves competitive performance in both settings, surpassing even the model that requires domain-ID, showcasing its superiority and generalization ability. The proposed method is not only effective but also maintains practicality and efficiency, as it does not introduce additional computational costs during inference.

- **Summary**: Monocular depth estimation from a single image is an ill-posed problem for computer vision due to insufficient reliable cues as the prior knowledge. Besides the inter-frame supervision, namely stereo and adjacent frames, extensive prior information is available in the same frame. Reflections from specular surfaces, informative intra-frame priors, enable us to reformulate the ill-posed depth estimation task as a multi-view synthesis. This paper proposes the first self-supervision for deep-learning depth estimation on water scenes via intra-frame priors, known as reflection supervision and geometrical constraints. In the first stage, a water segmentation network is performed to separate the reflection components from the entire image. Next, we construct a self-supervised framework to predict the target appearance from reflections, perceived as other perspectives. The photometric re-projection error, incorporating SmoothL1 and a novel photometric adaptive SSIM, is formulated to optimize pose and depth estimation by aligning the transformed virtual depths and source ones. As a supplement, the water surface is determined from real and virtual camera positions, which complement the depth of the water area. Furthermore, to alleviate these laborious ground truth annotations, we introduce a large-scale water reflection scene (WRS) dataset rendered from Unreal Engine 4. Extensive experiments on the WRS dataset prove the feasibility of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art depth estimation techniques.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models generate images with an unprecedented level of quality, but how can we freely rearrange image layouts? Recent works generate controllable scenes via learning spatially disentangled latent codes, but these methods do not apply to diffusion models due to their fixed forward process. In this work, we propose SceneDiffusion to optimize a layered scene representation during the diffusion sampling process. Our key insight is that spatial disentanglement can be obtained by jointly denoising scene renderings at different spatial layouts. Our generated scenes support a wide range of spatial editing operations, including moving, resizing, cloning, and layer-wise appearance editing operations, including object restyling and replacing. Moreover, a scene can be generated conditioned on a reference image, thus enabling object moving for in-the-wild images. Notably, this approach is training-free, compatible with general text-to-image diffusion models, and responsive in less than a second.

- **Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently empowered various novel computer vision (CV) tasks. In GNN-based CV tasks, a combination of CNN layers and GNN layers or only GNN layers are employed. This paper introduces GCV-Turbo, a domain-specific accelerator on FPGA for end-to-end acceleration of GNN-based CV tasks. GCV-Turbo consists of two key components: (1) a \emph{novel} hardware architecture optimized for the computation kernels in both CNNs and GNNs using the same set of computation resources. (2) a PyTorch-compatible compiler that takes a user-defined model as input, performs end-to-end optimization for the computation graph of a given GNN-based CV task, and produces optimized code for hardware execution. The hardware architecture and the compiler work synergistically to support a variety of GNN-based CV tasks. We implement GCV-Turbo on a state-of-the-art FPGA and evaluate its performance across six representative GNN-based CV tasks with diverse input data modalities (e.g., image, human skeleton, point cloud). Compared with state-of-the-art CPU (GPU) implementations, GCV-Turbo achieves an average latency reduction of $68.4\times$ ($4.1\times$) on these six GNN-based CV tasks. Moreover, GCV-Turbo supports the execution of the standalone CNNs or GNNs, achieving performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art CNN (GNN) accelerators for widely used CNN-only (GNN-only) models.

- **Summary**: We present InstantMesh, a feed-forward framework for instant 3D mesh generation from a single image, featuring state-of-the-art generation quality and significant training scalability. By synergizing the strengths of an off-the-shelf multiview diffusion model and a sparse-view reconstruction model based on the LRM architecture, InstantMesh is able to create diverse 3D assets within 10 seconds. To enhance the training efficiency and exploit more geometric supervisions, e.g, depths and normals, we integrate a differentiable iso-surface extraction module into our framework and directly optimize on the mesh representation. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that InstantMesh significantly outperforms other latest image-to-3D baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We release all the code, weights, and demo of InstantMesh, with the intention that it can make substantial contributions to the community of 3D generative AI and empower both researchers and content creators.

- **Summary**: We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generation of general forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our technique optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts. We initialize these splats by utilizing the state-of-the-art text-to-image generators, lifting their samples into 3D, and computing the occlusion volume. We then optimize this representation across multiple views as a 3D inpainting task with image-conditional diffusion models. To learn correct geometric structure, we incorporate a depth diffusion model by conditioning on the samples from the inpainting model, giving rich geometric structure. Finally, we finetune the model using sharpened samples from image generators. Notably, our technique does not require video or multi-view data and can synthesize a variety of high-quality 3D scenes in different styles, consisting of multiple objects. Its generality additionally allows 3D synthesis from a single image.

- **Summary**: We address prevailing challenges of the brain-powered research, departing from the observation that the literature hardly recover accurate spatial information and require subject-specific models. To address these challenges, we propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to extract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we introduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from subsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a cross-subject training strategy mapping subject-specific features to a common feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects without extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-specific models. Further, we demonstrate this supports weakly-supervised adaptation to new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments demonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly introduced tasks but also outperforms methods in well established tasks. To assess our method, we construct and share with the community a comprehensive brain understanding benchmark BrainHub. Our code and benchmark are available at https://weihaox.github.io/UMBRAE.

- **Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) are typically composed of a vision encoder, e.g. CLIP, and a language model (LM) that interprets the encoded features to solve downstream tasks. Despite remarkable progress, VLMs are subject to several shortcomings due to the limited capabilities of vision encoders, e.g. "blindness" to certain image features, visual hallucination, etc. To address these issues, we study broadening the visual encoding capabilities of VLMs. We first comprehensively benchmark several vision encoders with different inductive biases for solving VLM tasks. We observe that there is no single encoding configuration that consistently achieves top performance across different tasks, and encoders with different biases can perform surprisingly similarly. Motivated by this, we introduce a method, named BRAVE, that consolidates features from multiple frozen encoders into a more versatile representation that can be directly fed as the input to a frozen LM. BRAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of captioning and VQA benchmarks and significantly reduces the aforementioned issues of VLMs, while requiring a smaller number of trainable parameters than existing methods and having a more compressed representation. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating different visual biases for a more broad and contextualized visual understanding of VLMs.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce GoodDrag, a novel approach to improve the stability and image quality of drag editing. Unlike existing methods that struggle with accumulated perturbations and often result in distortions, GoodDrag introduces an AlDD framework that alternates between drag and denoising operations within the diffusion process, effectively improving the fidelity of the result. We also propose an information-preserving motion supervision operation that maintains the original features of the starting point for precise manipulation and artifact reduction. In addition, we contribute to the benchmarking of drag editing by introducing a new dataset, Drag100, and developing dedicated quality assessment metrics, Dragging Accuracy Index and Gemini Score, utilizing Large Multimodal Models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GoodDrag compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant progress in deep learning for dense visual recognition problems, such as semantic segmentation, traditional methods are constrained by fixed class sets. Meanwhile, vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have showcased remarkable effectiveness in numerous zero-shot image-level tasks, owing to their robust generalizability. Recently, a body of work has investigated utilizing these models in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However, existing approaches often rely on impractical supervised pre-training or access to additional pre-trained networks. In this work, we propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS, termed Neighbour-Aware CLIP (NACLIP), representing a straightforward adaptation of CLIP tailored for this scenario. Our method enforces localization of patches in the self-attention of CLIP's vision transformer which, despite being crucial for dense prediction tasks, has been overlooked in the OVSS literature. By incorporating design choices favouring segmentation, our approach significantly improves performance without requiring additional data, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning, making it highly practical for real-world applications. Experiments are performed on 8 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding state-of-the-art performance on most scenarios.

- **Summary**: Domain shift differences between training data for deep learning models and the deployment context can result in severe performance issues for models which fail to generalize. We study the domain shift problem under the context of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), a technique for video-based heart rate inference. We propose metrics based on model similarity which may be used as a measure of domain shift, and we demonstrate high correlation between these metrics and empirical performance. One of the proposed metrics with viable correlations, DS-diff, does not assume access to the ground truth of the target domain, i.e. it may be applied to in-the-wild data. To that end, we investigate a model selection problem in which ground truth results for the evaluation domain is not known, demonstrating a 13.9% performance improvement over the average case baseline.

- **Summary**: The majority of image processing approaches assume images are in or can be rectified to a perspective projection. However, in many applications it is beneficial to use non conventional cameras, such as fisheye cameras, that have a larger field of view (FOV). The issue arises that these large-FOV images can't be rectified to a perspective projection without significant cropping of the original image. To address this issue we propose Rectified Convolutions (RectConv); a new approach for adapting pre-trained convolutional networks to operate with new non-perspective images, without any retraining. Replacing the convolutional layers of the network with RectConv layers allows the network to see both rectified patches and the entire FOV. We demonstrate RectConv adapting multiple pre-trained networks to perform segmentation and detection on fisheye imagery from two publicly available datasets. Our approach requires no additional data or training, and operates directly on the native image as captured from the camera. We believe this work is a step toward adapting the vast resources available for perspective images to operate across a broad range of camera geometries.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels intends to achieve dense tasks without laborious annotations. However, due to the ambiguous contexts and fuzzy regions, the performance of WSSS, especially the stages of generating Class Activation Maps (CAMs) and refining pseudo masks, widely suffers from ambiguity while being barely noticed by previous literature. In this work, we propose UniA, a unified single-staged WSSS framework, to efficiently tackle this issue from the perspective of uncertainty inference and affinity diversification, respectively. When activating class objects, we argue that the false activation stems from the bias to the ambiguous regions during the feature extraction. Therefore, we design a more robust feature representation with a probabilistic Gaussian distribution and introduce the uncertainty estimation to avoid the bias. A distribution loss is particularly proposed to supervise the process, which effectively captures the ambiguity and models the complex dependencies among features. When refining pseudo labels, we observe that the affinity from the prevailing refinement methods intends to be similar among ambiguities. To this end, an affinity diversification module is proposed to promote diversity among semantics. A mutual complementing refinement is proposed to initially rectify the ambiguous affinity with multiple inferred pseudo labels. More importantly, a contrastive affinity loss is further designed to diversify the relations among unrelated semantics, which reliably propagates the diversity into the whole feature representations and helps generate better pseudo masks. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and medical ACDC datasets, which validate the efficiency of UniA tackling ambiguity and the superiority over recent single-staged or even most multi-staged competitors.

- **Summary**: This paper investigates the performance of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) when scaled down to limited computation budgets. We explore CLIP along three dimensions: data, architecture, and training strategies. With regards to data, we demonstrate the significance of high-quality training data and show that a smaller dataset of high-quality data can outperform a larger dataset with lower quality. We also examine how model performance varies with different dataset sizes, suggesting that smaller ViT models are better suited for smaller datasets, while larger models perform better on larger datasets with fixed compute. Additionally, we provide guidance on when to choose a CNN-based architecture or a ViT-based architecture for CLIP training. We compare four CLIP training strategies - SLIP, FLIP, CLIP, and CLIP+Data Augmentation - and show that the choice of training strategy depends on the available compute resource. Our analysis reveals that CLIP+Data Augmentation can achieve comparable performance to CLIP using only half of the training data. This work provides practical insights into how to effectively train and deploy CLIP models, making them more accessible and affordable for practical use in various applications.

- **Summary**: In medical imaging, accurate image segmentation is crucial for quantifying diseases, assessing prognosis, and evaluating treatment outcomes. However, existing methods lack an in-depth integration of global and local features, failing to pay special attention to abnormal regions and boundary details in medical images. To this end, we present a novel deep learning-based approach, MIPC-Net, for precise boundary segmentation in medical images. Our approach, inspired by radiologists' working patterns, features two distinct modules: (i) \textbf{Mutual Inclusion of Position and Channel Attention (MIPC) module}: To enhance the precision of boundary segmentation in medical images, we introduce the MIPC module, which enhances the focus on channel information when extracting position features and vice versa; (ii) \textbf{GL-MIPC-Residue}: To improve the restoration of medical images, we propose the GL-MIPC-Residue, a global residual connection that enhances the integration of the encoder and decoder by filtering out invalid information and restoring the most effective information lost during the feature extraction process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model using metrics such as Dice coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) on three publicly accessible datasets: Synapse, ISIC2018-Task, and Segpc. Our ablation study shows that each module contributes to improving the quality of segmentation results. Furthermore, with the assistance of both modules, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics on the benchmark datasets, notably achieving a 2.23mm reduction in HD on the Synapse dataset, strongly evidencing our model's enhanced capability for precise image boundary segmentation.

- **Summary**: The increase of web-scale weakly labelled image-text pairs have greatly facilitated the development of large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), which have shown impressive generalization performance over a series of downstream tasks. However, the massive model size and scarcity of available data limit their applications to fine-tune the whole model in downstream tasks. Besides, fully fine-tuning the model easily forgets the generic essential knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage and overfits the downstream data. To enable high efficiency when adapting these large vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to performing continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) while preserving their generalizability, we propose a novel strategy (AdaptSign). Especially, CLIP is adopted as the visual backbone to extract frame-wise features whose parameters are fixed, and a set of learnable modules are introduced to model spatial sign variations or capture temporal sign movements. The introduced additional modules are quite lightweight, only owning 3.2% extra computations with high efficiency. The generic knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage is well-preserved in the frozen CLIP backbone in this process. Extensive experiments show that despite being efficient, AdaptSign is able to demonstrate superior performance across a series of CSLR benchmarks including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily and CSL compared to existing methods. Visualizations show that AdaptSign could learn to dynamically pay major attention to the informative spatial regions and cross-frame trajectories in sign videos.

- **Summary**: Determining dense feature points on fingerprints used in constructing deep fixed-length representations for accurate matching, particularly at the pixel level, is of significant interest. To explore the interpretability of fingerprint matching, we propose a multi-stage interpretable fingerprint matching network, namely Interpretable Fixed-length Representation for Fingerprint Matching via Vision Transformer (IFViT), which consists of two primary modules. The first module, an interpretable dense registration module, establishes a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Siamese Network to capture long-range dependencies and the global context in fingerprint pairs. It provides interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points for fingerprint alignment and enhances the interpretability in the subsequent matching stage. The second module takes into account both local and global representations of the aligned fingerprint pair to achieve an interpretable fixed-length representation extraction and matching. It employs the ViTs trained in the first module with the additional fully connected layer and retrains them to simultaneously produce the discriminative fixed-length representation and interpretable dense pixel-wise correspondences of feature points. Extensive experimental results on diverse publicly available fingerprint databases demonstrate that the proposed framework not only exhibits superior performance on dense registration and matching but also significantly promotes the interpretability in deep fixed-length representations-based fingerprint matching.

- **Summary**: Eyes serve as our primary sensory organs, responsible for processing up to 80\% of our sensory input. However, common visual aberrations like myopia and hyperopia affect a significant portion of the global population. This paper focuses on simulating a Vision Correction Display (VCD) to enhance the visual experience of individuals with various visual impairments. Utilising Blender, we digitally model the functionality of a VCD in correcting refractive errors such as myopia and hyperopia. With these simulations we can see potential improvements in visual acuity and comfort. These simulations provide valuable insights for the design and development of future VCD technologies, ultimately advancing accessibility and usability for individuals with visual challenges.

- **Summary**: The latest regularized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approaches produce poor geometry and view extrapolation for multiview stereo (MVS) benchmarks such as ETH3D. In this paper, we aim to create 3D models that provide accurate geometry and view synthesis, partially closing the large geometric performance gap between NeRF and traditional MVS methods. We propose a patch-based approach that effectively leverages monocular surface normal and relative depth predictions. The patch-based ray sampling also enables the appearance regularization of normalized cross-correlation (NCC) and structural similarity (SSIM) between randomly sampled virtual and training views. We further show that "density restrictions" based on sparse structure-from-motion points can help greatly improve geometric accuracy with a slight drop in novel view synthesis metrics. Our experiments show 4x the performance of RegNeRF and 8x that of FreeNeRF on average F1@2cm for ETH3D MVS benchmark, suggesting a fruitful research direction to improve the geometric accuracy of NeRF-based models, and sheds light on a potential future approach to enable NeRF-based optimization to eventually outperform traditional MVS.

- **Summary**: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have made significant advancements in image segmentation, allowing users to segment target portions of an image with a single click (i.e., user prompt). Given its broad applications, the robustness of SAM against adversarial attacks is a critical concern. While recent works have explored adversarial attacks against a pre-defined prompt/click, their threat model is not yet realistic: (1) they often assume the user-click position is known to the attacker (point-based attack), and (2) they often operate under a white-box setting with limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a more practical region-level attack where attackers do not need to know the precise user prompt. The attack remains effective as the user clicks on any point on the target object in the image, hiding the object from SAM. Also, by adapting a spectrum transformation method, we make the attack more transferable under a black-box setting. Both control experiments and testing against real-world SAM services confirm its effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Observations with distributed sensors are essential in analyzing a series of human and machine activities (referred to as 'events' in this paper) in complex and extensive real-world environments. This is because the information obtained from a single sensor is often missing or fragmented in such an environment; observations from multiple locations and modalities should be integrated to analyze events comprehensively. However, a learning method has yet to be established to extract joint representations that effectively combine such distributed observations. Therefore, we propose Guided Masked sELf-Distillation modeling (Guided-MELD) for inter-sensor relationship modeling. The basic idea of Guided-MELD is to learn to supplement the information from the masked sensor with information from other sensors needed to detect the event. Guided-MELD is expected to enable the system to effectively distill the fragmented or redundant target event information obtained by the sensors without being overly dependent on any specific sensors. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in novel tasks of distributed multimedia sensor event analysis, we recorded two new datasets that fit the problem setting: MM-Store and MM-Office. These datasets consist of human activities in a convenience store and an office, recorded using distributed cameras and microphones. Experimental results on these datasets show that the proposed Guided-MELD improves event tagging and detection performance and outperforms conventional inter-sensor relationship modeling methods. Furthermore, the proposed method performed robustly even when sensors were reduced.



### Struggle with Adversarial Defense? Try Diffusion

- **Summary**: Adversarial attacks induce misclassification by introducing subtle perturbations. Recently, diffusion models are applied to the image classifiers to improve adversarial robustness through adversarial training or by purifying adversarial noise. However, diffusion-based adversarial training often encounters convergence challenges and high computational expenses. Additionally, diffusion-based purification inevitably causes data shift and is deemed susceptible to stronger adaptive attacks. To tackle these issues, we propose the Truth Maximization Diffusion Classifier (TMDC), a generative Bayesian classifier that builds upon pre-trained diffusion models and the Bayesian theorem. Unlike data-driven classifiers, TMDC, guided by Bayesian principles, utilizes the conditional likelihood from diffusion models to determine the class probabilities of input images, thereby insulating against the influences of data shift and the limitations of adversarial training. Moreover, to enhance TMDC's resilience against more potent adversarial attacks, we propose an optimization strategy for diffusion classifiers. This strategy involves post-training the diffusion model on perturbed datasets with ground-truth labels as conditions, guiding the diffusion model to learn the data distribution and maximizing the likelihood under the ground-truth labels. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR10 dataset against heavy white-box attacks and strong adaptive attacks. Specifically, TMDC achieves robust accuracies of 82.81% against $l_{\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations and 86.05% against $l_{2}$ norm-bounded perturbations, respectively, with $\epsilon=0.05$.

- **Summary**: With the advent of social media, fun selfie filters have come into tremendous mainstream use affecting the functioning of facial biometric systems as well as image recognition systems. These filters vary from beautification filters and Augmented Reality (AR)-based filters to filters that modify facial landmarks. Hence, there is a need to assess the impact of such filters on the performance of existing face recognition systems. The limitation associated with existing solutions is that these solutions focus more on the beautification filters. However, the current AR-based filters and filters which distort facial key points are in vogue recently and make the faces highly unrecognizable even to the naked eye. Also, the filters considered are mostly obsolete with limited variations. To mitigate these limitations, we aim to perform a holistic impact analysis of the latest filters and propose an user recognition model with the filtered images. We have utilized a benchmark dataset for baseline images, and applied the latest filters over them to generate a beautified/filtered dataset. Next, we have introduced a model FaceFilterNet for beautified user recognition. In this framework, we also utilize our model to comment on various attributes of the person including age, gender, and ethnicity. In addition, we have also presented a filter-wise impact analysis on face recognition, age estimation, gender, and ethnicity prediction. The proposed method affirms the efficacy of our dataset with an accuracy of 87.25% and an optimal accuracy for facial attribute analysis.

- **Summary**: Breast cancer is a relatively common cancer among gynecological cancers. Its diagnosis often relies on the pathology of cells in the lesion. The pathological diagnosis of breast cancer not only requires professionals and time, but also sometimes involves subjective judgment. To address the challenges of dependence on pathologists expertise and the time-consuming nature of achieving accurate breast pathological image classification, this paper introduces an approach utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the rapid categorization of pathological images, aiming to enhance the efficiency of breast pathological image detection. And the approach enables the rapid and automatic classification of pathological images into benign and malignant groups. The methodology involves utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model leveraging the Inceptionv3 architecture and transfer learning algorithm for extracting features from pathological images. Utilizing a neural network with fully connected layers and employing the SoftMax function for image classification. Additionally, the concept of image partitioning is introduced to handle high-resolution images. To achieve the ultimate classification outcome, the classification probabilities of each image block are aggregated using three algorithms: summation, product, and maximum. Experimental validation was conducted on the BreaKHis public dataset, resulting in accuracy rates surpassing 0.92 across all four magnification coefficients (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). It demonstrates that the proposed method effectively enhances the accuracy in classifying pathological images of breast cancer.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation aims to segment an object referred to by natural language expression from an image. The primary challenge lies in the efficient propagation of fine-grained semantic information from textual features to visual features. Many recent works utilize a Transformer to address this challenge. However, conventional transformer decoders can distort linguistic information with deeper layers, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce CRFormer, a model that iteratively calibrates multi-modal features in the transformer decoder. We start by generating language queries using vision features, emphasizing different aspects of the input language. Then, we propose a novel Calibration Decoder (CDec) wherein the multi-modal features can iteratively calibrated by the input language features. In the Calibration Decoder, we use the output of each decoder layer and the original language features to generate new queries for continuous calibration, which gradually updates the language features. Based on CDec, we introduce a Language Reconstruction Module and a reconstruction loss. This module leverages queries from the final layer of the decoder to reconstruct the input language and compute the reconstruction loss. This can further prevent the language information from being lost or distorted. Our experiments consistently show the superior performance of our approach across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

- **Summary**: In recent years, there has been significant attention given to the robustness assessment of neural networks. Robustness plays a critical role in ensuring reliable operation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in complex and uncertain environments. Deep learning's robustness problem is particularly significant, highlighted by the discovery of adversarial attacks on image classification models. Researchers have dedicated efforts to evaluate robustness in diverse perturbation conditions for image recognition tasks. Robustness assessment encompasses two main techniques: robustness verification/ certification for deliberate adversarial attacks and robustness testing for random data corruptions. In this survey, we present a detailed examination of both adversarial robustness (AR) and corruption robustness (CR) in neural network assessment. Analyzing current research papers and standards, we provide an extensive overview of robustness assessment in image recognition. Three essential aspects are analyzed: concepts, metrics, and assessment methods. We investigate the perturbation metrics and range representations used to measure the degree of perturbations on images, as well as the robustness metrics specifically for the robustness conditions of classification models. The strengths and limitations of the existing methods are also discussed, and some potential directions for future research are provided.

- **Summary**: Convolutional neural networks have often been proposed for processing radar Micro-Doppler signatures, most commonly with the goal of classifying the signals. The majority of works tend to disregard phase information from the complex time-frequency representation. Here, the utility of the phase information, as well as the optimal format of the Doppler-time input for a convolutional neural network, is analysed. It is found that the performance achieved by convolutional neural network classifiers is heavily influenced by the type of input representation, even across formats with equivalent information. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the phase component of the Doppler-time representation contains rich information useful for classification and that unwrapping the phase in the temporal dimension can improve the results compared to a magnitude-only solution, improving accuracy from 0.920 to 0.938 on the tested human activity dataset. Further improvement of 0.947 is achieved by training a linear classifier on embeddings from multiple-formats.

- **Summary**: Existing angle-based contour descriptors suffer from lossy representation for non-starconvex shapes. By and large, this is the result of the shape being registered with a single global inner center and a set of radii corresponding to a polar coordinate parameterization. In this paper, we propose AdaContour, an adaptive contour descriptor that uses multiple local representations to desirably characterize complex shapes. After hierarchically encoding object shapes in a training set and constructing a contour matrix of all subdivided regions, we compute a robust low-rank robust subspace and approximate each local contour by linearly combining the shared basis vectors to represent an object. Experiments show that AdaContour is able to represent shapes more accurately and robustly than other descriptors while retaining effectiveness. We validate AdaContour by integrating it into off-the-shelf detectors to enable instance segmentation which demonstrates faithful performance. The code is available at https://github.com/tding1/AdaContour.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on improving object detection performance by addressing the issue of image distortions, commonly encountered in uncontrolled acquisition environments. High-level computer vision tasks such as object detection, recognition, and segmentation are particularly sensitive to image distortion. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach employing an image defilter to rectify image distortion prior to object detection. This method enhances object detection accuracy, as models perform optimally when trained on non-distorted images. Our experiments demonstrate that utilizing defiltered images significantly improves mean average precision compared to training object detection models on distorted images. Consequently, our proposed method offers considerable benefits for real-world applications plagued by image distortion. To our knowledge, the contribution lies in employing distortion-removal paradigm for object detection on images captured in natural settings. We achieved an improvement of 0.562 and 0.564 of mean Average precision on validation and test data.

- **Summary**: The treatment of interfering motion contributions remains one of the key challenges in the domain of radar-based vital sign monitoring. Removal of the interference to extract the vital sign contributions is demanding due to overlapping Doppler bands, the complex structure of the interference motions and significant variations in the power levels of their contributions. A novel approach to the removal of interference through the use of a probabilistic deep learning model is presented. Results show that a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network with a variational objective is capable of learning a meaningful representation space of vital sign Doppler-time distribution facilitating their extraction from a mixture signal. The approach is tested on semi-experimental data containing real vital sign signatures and simulated returns from interfering body motions. The application of the proposed network enhances the extraction of the micro-Doppler frequency corresponding to the respiration rate is demonstrated.

- **Summary**: Scanning real-life scenes with modern registration devices typically gives incomplete point cloud representations, primarily due to the limitations of partial scanning, 3D occlusions, and dynamic light conditions. Recent works on processing incomplete point clouds have always focused on point cloud completion. However, these approaches do not ensure consistency between the completed point cloud and the captured images regarding color and geometry. We propose using Generative Point-based NeRF (GPN) to reconstruct and repair a partial cloud by fully utilizing the scanning images and the corresponding reconstructed cloud. The repaired point cloud can achieve multi-view consistency with the captured images at high spatial resolution. For the finetunes of a single scene, we optimize the global latent condition by incorporating an Auto-Decoder architecture while retaining multi-view consistency. As a result, the generated point clouds are smooth, plausible, and geometrically consistent with the partial scanning images. Extensive experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that our works achieve competitive performances to the other state-of-the-art point cloud-based neural scene rendering and editing performances.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Saliency-Based Adaptive Masking (SBAM), a novel and cost-effective approach that significantly enhances the pre-training performance of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) approaches by prioritizing token salience. Our method provides robustness against variations in masking ratios, effectively mitigating the performance instability issues common in existing methods. This relaxes the sensitivity of MIM-based pre-training to masking ratios, which in turn allows us to propose an adaptive strategy for `tailored' masking ratios for each data sample, which no existing method can provide. Toward this goal, we propose an Adaptive Masking Ratio (AMR) strategy that dynamically adjusts the proportion of masking for the unique content of each image based on token salience. We show that our method significantly improves over the state-of-the-art in mask-based pre-training on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

- **Summary**: Driven by the success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), the realm of self-supervised learning for computer vision has been invigorated by the central role of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in driving recent breakthroughs. Notwithstanding the achievements of MIM across various downstream tasks, its overall efficiency is occasionally hampered by the lengthy duration of the pre-training phase. This paper presents a perspective that the optimization of masked tokens as a means of addressing the prevailing issue. Initially, we delve into an exploration of the inherent properties that a masked token ought to possess. Within the properties, we principally dedicated to articulating and emphasizing the `data singularity' attribute inherent in masked tokens. Through a comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneity between masked tokens and visible tokens within pre-trained models, we propose a novel approach termed masked token optimization (MTO), specifically designed to improve model efficiency through weight recalibration and the enhancement of the key property of masked tokens. The proposed method serves as an adaptable solution that seamlessly integrates into any MIM approach that leverages masked tokens. As a result, MTO achieves a considerable improvement in pre-training efficiency, resulting in an approximately 50% reduction in pre-training epochs required to attain converged performance of the recent approaches.



### Counterfactual Explanations for Face Forgery Detection via Adversarial Removal of Artifacts

- **Summary**: Highly realistic AI generated face forgeries known as deepfakes have raised serious social concerns. Although DNN-based face forgery detection models have achieved good performance, they are vulnerable to latest generative methods that have less forgery traces and adversarial attacks. This limitation of generalization and robustness hinders the credibility of detection results and requires more explanations. In this work, we provide counterfactual explanations for face forgery detection from an artifact removal perspective. Specifically, we first invert the forgery images into the StyleGAN latent space, and then adversarially optimize their latent representations with the discrimination supervision from the target detection model. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed explanations from two aspects: (1) Counterfactual Trace Visualization: the enhanced forgery images are useful to reveal artifacts by visually contrasting the original images and two different visualization methods; (2) Transferable Adversarial Attacks: the adversarial forgery images generated by attacking the detection model are able to mislead other detection models, implying the removed artifacts are general. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% attack success rate and superior attack transferability. Compared with naive adversarial noise methods, our method adopts both generative and discriminative model priors, and optimize the latent representations in a synthesis-by-analysis way, which forces the search of counterfactual explanations on the natural face manifold. Thus, more general counterfactual traces can be found and better adversarial attack transferability can be achieved.

- **Summary**: Multi-modal learning aims to enhance performance by unifying models from various modalities but often faces the "modality imbalance" problem in real data, leading to a bias towards dominant modalities and neglecting others, thereby limiting its overall effectiveness. To address this challenge, the core idea is to balance the optimization of each modality to achieve a joint optimum. Existing approaches often employ a modal-level control mechanism for adjusting the update of each modal parameter. However, such a global-wise updating mechanism ignores the different importance of each parameter. Inspired by subnetwork optimization, we explore a uniform sampling-based optimization strategy and find it more effective than global-wise updating. According to the findings, we further propose a novel importance sampling-based, element-wise joint optimization method, called Adaptively Mask Subnetworks Considering Modal Significance(AMSS). Specifically, we incorporate mutual information rates to determine the modal significance and employ non-uniform adaptive sampling to select foreground subnetworks from each modality for parameter updates, thereby rebalancing multi-modal learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the reliability of the AMSS strategy through convergence analysis. Building upon theoretical insights, we further enhance the multi-modal mask subnetwork strategy using unbiased estimation, referred to as AMSS+. Extensive experiments reveal the superiority of our approach over comparison methods.

- **Summary**: Neural implicit k-space representations have shown promising results for dynamic MRI at high temporal resolutions. Yet, their exclusive training in k-space limits the application of common image regularization methods to improve the final reconstruction. In this work, we introduce the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), which we incorporate as novel self-supervised k-space regularization enforcing a consistent neighborhood relationship. At no additional data cost, the proposed regularization significantly improves neural implicit k-space reconstructions on simulated data. Abdominal in-vivo reconstructions using PISCO result in enhanced spatio-temporal image quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/vjspi/PISCO-NIK.

- **Summary**: The field of Earth Observations (EO) offers a wealth of data from diverse sensors, presenting a great opportunity for advancing self-supervised multimodal learning. However, current multimodal EO datasets and models focus on a single data type, either mono-date images or time series, which limits their expressivity. We introduce OmniSat, a novel architecture that exploits the spatial alignment between multiple EO modalities to learn expressive multimodal representations without labels. To demonstrate the advantages of combining modalities of different natures, we augment two existing datasets with new modalities. As demonstrated on three downstream tasks: forestry, land cover classification, and crop mapping. OmniSat can learn rich representations in an unsupervised manner, leading to improved performance in the semi- and fully-supervised settings, even when only one modality is available for inference. The code and dataset are available at github.com/gastruc/OmniSat.

- **Summary**: The generalization of the end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for object-goal visual navigation is a long-standing challenge since object classes and placements vary in new test environments. Learning domain-independent visual representation is critical for enabling the trained DRL agent with the ability to generalize to unseen scenes and objects. In this letter, a target-directed attention network (TDANet) is proposed to learn the end-to-end object-goal visual navigation policy with zero-shot ability. TDANet features a novel target attention (TA) module that learns both the spatial and semantic relationships among objects to help TDANet focus on the most relevant observed objects to the target. With the Siamese architecture (SA) design, TDANet distinguishes the difference between the current and target states and generates the domain-independent visual representation. To evaluate the navigation performance of TDANet, extensive experiments are conducted in the AI2-THOR embodied AI environment. The simulation results demonstrate a strong generalization ability of TDANet to unseen scenes and target objects, with higher navigation success rate (SR) and success weighted by length (SPL) than other state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of self-supervised 3D scene flow estimation from real large-scale raw point cloud sequences, which is crucial to various tasks like trajectory prediction or instance segmentation. In the absence of ground truth scene flow labels, contemporary approaches concentrate on deducing optimizing flow across sequential pairs of point clouds by incorporating structure based regularization on flow and object rigidity. The rigid objects are estimated by a variety of 3D spatial clustering methods. While state-of-the-art methods successfully capture overall scene motion using the Neural Prior structure, they encounter challenges in discerning multi-object motions. We identified the structural constraints and the use of large and strict rigid clusters as the main pitfall of the current approaches and we propose a novel clustering approach that allows for combination of overlapping soft clusters as well as non-overlapping rigid clusters representation. Flow is then jointly estimated with progressively growing non-overlapping rigid clusters together with fixed size overlapping soft clusters. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets with LiDAR point clouds, demonstrating the superior performance over the self-supervised baselines reaching new state of the art results. Our method especially excels in resolving flow in complicated dynamic scenes with multiple independently moving objects close to each other which includes pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users. Our codes will be publicly available.

- **Summary**: Despite their exceptional performance in vision tasks, deep learning models often struggle when faced with domain shifts during testing. Test-Time Training (TTT) methods have recently gained popularity by their ability to enhance the robustness of models through the addition of an auxiliary objective that is jointly optimized with the main task. Being strictly unsupervised, this auxiliary objective is used at test time to adapt the model without any access to labels. In this work, we propose Noise-Contrastive Test-Time Training (NC-TTT), a novel unsupervised TTT technique based on the discrimination of noisy feature maps. By learning to classify noisy views of projected feature maps, and then adapting the model accordingly on new domains, classification performance can be recovered by an important margin. Experiments on several popular test-time adaptation baselines demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to recent approaches for this task.

- **Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous edge computing in space are emerging areas of interest to augment capabilities of nanosatellites, where modern sensors generate orders of magnitude more data than can typically be transmitted to mission control. Here, we present the hardware and software design of an onboard AI subsystem hosted on SpIRIT. The system is optimised for on-board computer vision experiments based on visible light and long wave infrared cameras. This paper highlights the key design choices made to maximise the robustness of the system in harsh space conditions, and their motivation relative to key mission requirements, such as limited compute resources, resilience to cosmic radiation, extreme temperature variations, distribution shifts, and very low transmission bandwidths. The payload, called Loris, consists of six visible light cameras, three infrared cameras, a camera control board and a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) system-on-module. Loris enables the execution of AI models with on-orbit fine-tuning as well as a next-generation image compression algorithm, including progressive coding. This innovative approach not only enhances the data processing capabilities of nanosatellites but also lays the groundwork for broader applications to remote sensing from space.

- **Summary**: Broadcast sports field registration is traditionally addressed as a homography estimation task, mapping the visible image area to a planar field model, predominantly focusing on the main camera shot. Addressing the shortcomings of previous approaches, we propose a novel calibration pipeline enabling camera calibration using a 3D soccer field model and extending the process to assess the multiple-view nature of broadcast videos. Our approach begins with a keypoint generation pipeline derived from SoccerNet dataset annotations, leveraging the geometric properties of the court. Subsequently, we execute classical camera calibration through DLT algorithm in a minimalist fashion, without further refinement. Through extensive experimentation on real-world soccer broadcast datasets such as SoccerNet-Calibration, WorldCup 2014 and TS- WorldCup, our method demonstrates superior performance in both multiple- and single-view 3D camera calibration while maintaining competitive results in homography estimation compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

- **Summary**: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information from different modalities into a single fused image to represent the imaging scene and facilitate downstream visual tasks comprehensively. In recent years, significant progress has been made in MMIF tasks due to advances in deep neural networks. However, existing methods cannot effectively and efficiently extract modality-specific and modality-fused features constrained by the inherent local reductive bias (CNN) or quadratic computational complexity (Transformers). To overcome this issue, we propose a Mamba-based Dual-phase Fusion (MambaDFuse) model. Firstly, a dual-level feature extractor is designed to capture long-range features from single-modality images by extracting low and high-level features from CNN and Mamba blocks. Then, a dual-phase feature fusion module is proposed to obtain fusion features that combine complementary information from different modalities. It uses the channel exchange method for shallow fusion and the enhanced Multi-modal Mamba (M3) blocks for deep fusion. Finally, the fused image reconstruction module utilizes the inverse transformation of the feature extraction to generate the fused result. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves promising fusion results in infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion. Additionally, in a unified benchmark, MambaDFuse has also demonstrated improved performance in downstream tasks such as object detection. Code with checkpoints will be available after the peer-review process.

- **Summary**: Pose diversity is an inherent representative characteristic of 2D images. Due to the 3D to 2D projection mechanism, there is evident content discrepancy among distinct pose images. This is the main obstacle bothering pose transformation related researches. To deal with this challenge, we propose a fine-grained incremental evolution centered pose generation framework, rather than traditional direct one-to-one in a rush. Since proposed approach actually bypasses the theoretical difficulty of directly modeling dramatic non-linear variation, the incurred content distortion and blurring could be effectively constrained, at the same time the various individual pose details, especially clothes texture, could be precisely maintained. In order to systematically guide the evolution course, both global and incremental evolution constraints are elaborately designed and merged into the overall frame?work. And a novel triple-path knowledge fusion structure is worked out to take full advantage of all available valuable knowledge to conduct high-quality pose synthesis. In addition, our framework could generate a series of valuable byproducts, namely the various intermediate poses. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code is available at https://github.com/Xiaofei-CN/Incremental-Evolution-Pose-Generation.

- **Summary**: The interactive segmentation task consists in the creation of object segmentation masks based on user interactions. The most common way to guide a model towards producing a correct segmentation consists in clicks on the object and background. The recently published Segment Anything Model (SAM) supports a generalized version of the interactive segmentation problem and has been trained on an object segmentation dataset which contains 1.1B masks. Though being trained extensively and with the explicit purpose of serving as a foundation model, we show significant limitations of SAM when being applied for interactive segmentation on novel domains or object types. On the used datasets, SAM displays a failure rate $\text{FR}_{30}@90$ of up to $72.6 \%$. Since we still want such foundation models to be immediately applicable, we present a framework that can adapt SAM during immediate usage. For this we will leverage the user interactions and masks, which are constructed during the interactive segmentation process. We use this information to generate pseudo-labels, which we use to compute a loss function and optimize a part of the SAM model. The presented method causes a relative reduction of up to $48.1 \%$ in the $\text{FR}_{20}@85$ and $46.6 \%$ in the $\text{FR}_{30}@90$ metrics.

- **Summary**: Unlike typical video action recognition, Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) does not involve distinct moving targets but relies on localized changes in facial muscles. Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.

- **Summary**: Rendering dynamic 3D human from monocular videos is crucial for various applications such as virtual reality and digital entertainment. Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area. Extensive experiments both in simulated and real-world occlusions, demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. And we improving training and inference speeds by 250x and 800x, respectively. Our code will be available for research purposes.

- **Summary**: Face recognition systems are frequently subjected to a variety of physical and digital attacks of different types. Previous methods have achieved satisfactory performance in scenarios that address physical attacks and digital attacks, respectively. However, few methods are considered to integrate a model that simultaneously addresses both physical and digital attacks, implying the necessity to develop and maintain multiple models. To jointly detect physical and digital attacks within a single model, we propose an innovative approach that can adapt to any network architecture. Our approach mainly contains two types of data augmentation, which we call Simulated Physical Spoofing Clues augmentation (SPSC) and Simulated Digital Spoofing Clues augmentation (SDSC). SPSC and SDSC augment live samples into simulated attack samples by simulating spoofing clues of physical and digital attacks, respectively, which significantly improve the capability of the model to detect "unseen" attack types. Extensive experiments show that SPSC and SDSC can achieve state-of-the-art generalization in Protocols 2.1 and 2.2 of the UniAttackData dataset, respectively. Our method won first place in "Unified Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection" of the 5th Face Anti-spoofing Challenge@CVPR2024. Our final submission obtains 3.75% APCER, 0.93% BPCER, and 2.34% ACER, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xianhua-He/cvpr2024-face-anti-spoofing-challenge.

- **Summary**: Deepfakes have recently raised significant trust issues and security concerns among the public. Compared to CNN face forgery detectors, ViT-based methods take advantage of the expressivity of transformers, achieving superior detection performance. However, these approaches still exhibit the following limitations: (1). Fully fine-tuning ViT-based models from ImageNet weights demands substantial computational and storage resources; (2). ViT-based methods struggle to capture local forgery clues, leading to model bias and limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this work introduces Mixture-of-Experts modules for Face Forgery Detection (MoE-FFD), a generalized yet parameter-efficient ViT-based approach. MoE-FFD only updates lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Adapter layers while keeping the ViT backbone frozen, thereby achieving parameter-efficient training. Moreover, MoE-FFD leverages the expressivity of transformers and local priors of CNNs to simultaneously extract global and local forgery clues. Additionally, novel MoE modules are designed to scale the model's capacity and select optimal forgery experts, further enhancing forgery detection performance. The proposed MoE learning scheme can be seamlessly adapted to various transformer backbones in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art face forgery detection performance with reduced parameter overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Besides being projective invariants, the proposed markers allow producing rich panel of unique identifiers, highly required for resource-intensive navigation and augmented reality applications. The spiral topology of our markers permits the validation of an accurate identification scheme, which is based on level set methods. The robustness of the markers against acquisition and geometric distortions is validated by extensive experimental tests.



### SpectralMamba: Efficient Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification

- **Summary**: Recurrent neural networks and Transformers have recently dominated most applications in hyperspectral (HS) imaging, owing to their capability to capture long-range dependencies from spectrum sequences. However, despite the success of these sequential architectures, the non-ignorable inefficiency caused by either difficulty in parallelization or computationally prohibitive attention still hinders their practicality, especially for large-scale observation in remote sensing scenarios. To address this issue, we herein propose SpectralMamba -- a novel state space model incorporated efficient deep learning framework for HS image classification. SpectralMamba features the simplified but adequate modeling of HS data dynamics at two levels. First, in spatial-spectral space, a dynamical mask is learned by efficient convolutions to simultaneously encode spatial regularity and spectral peculiarity, thus attenuating the spectral variability and confusion in discriminative representation learning. Second, the merged spectrum can then be efficiently operated in the hidden state space with all parameters learned input-dependent, yielding selectively focused responses without reliance on redundant attention or imparallelizable recurrence. To explore the room for further computational downsizing, a piece-wise scanning mechanism is employed in-between, transferring approximately continuous spectrum into sequences with squeezed length while maintaining short- and long-term contextual profiles among hundreds of bands. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark HS datasets acquired by satellite-, aircraft-, and UAV-borne imagers, SpectralMamba surprisingly creates promising win-wins from both performance and efficiency perspectives.

- **Summary**: Capturing the 3D human body is one of the important tasks in computer vision with a wide range of applications such as virtual reality and sports analysis. However, conventional frame cameras are limited by their temporal resolution and dynamic range, which imposes constraints in real-world application setups. Event cameras have the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range (HDR), but the development of event-based methods is necessary to handle data with different characteristics. This paper proposes a novel event-based method for 3D pose estimation and human mesh recovery. Prior work on event-based human mesh recovery require frames (images) as well as event data. The proposed method solely relies on events; it carves 3D voxels by moving the event camera around a stationary body, reconstructs the human pose and mesh by attenuated rays, and fit statistical body models, preserving high-frequency details. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional frame-based methods in the estimation accuracy of both pose and body mesh. We also demonstrate results in challenging situations where a conventional camera has motion blur. This is the first to demonstrate event-only human mesh recovery, and we hope that it is the first step toward achieving robust and accurate 3D human body scanning from vision sensors.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements have empowered Large Language Models for Vision (vLLMs) to generate detailed perceptual outcomes, including bounding boxes and masks. Nonetheless, there are two constraints that restrict the further application of these vLLMs: the incapability of handling multiple targets per query and the failure to identify the absence of query objects in the image. In this study, we acknowledge that the main cause of these problems is the insufficient complexity of training queries. Consequently, we define the general sequence format for complex queries. Then we incorporate a semantic segmentation task in the current pipeline to fulfill the requirements of training data. Furthermore, we present three novel strategies to effectively handle the challenges arising from the direct integration of the proposed format. The effectiveness of our model in processing complex queries is validated by the comparable results with conventional methods on both close-set and open-set semantic segmentation datasets. Additionally, we outperform a series of vLLMs in reasoning and referring segmentation, showcasing our model's remarkable capabilities. We release the code at https://github.com/congvvc/LaSagnA.

- **Summary**: Despite the significant progress in image denoising, it is still challenging to restore fine-scale details while removing noise, especially in extremely low-light environments. Leveraging near-infrared (NIR) images to assist visible RGB image denoising shows the potential to address this issue, becoming a promising technology. Nonetheless, existing works still struggle with taking advantage of NIR information effectively for real-world image denoising, due to the content inconsistency between NIR-RGB images and the scarcity of real-world paired datasets. To alleviate the problem, we propose an efficient Selective Fusion Module (SFM), which can be plug-and-played into the advanced denoising networks to merge the deep NIR-RGB features. Specifically, we sequentially perform the global and local modulation for NIR and RGB features, and then integrate the two modulated features. Furthermore, we present a Real-world NIR-Assisted Image Denoising (Real-NAID) dataset, which covers diverse scenarios as well as various noise levels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and our real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results than state-of-the-art ones. The dataset, codes, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ronjonxu/NAID.

- **Summary**: Object counting is a popular task in deep learning applications in various domains, including agriculture. A conventional deep learning approach requires a large amount of training data, often a logistic problem in a real-world application. To address this issue, we examined how well ChatGPT (GPT4V) and a general-purpose AI (foundation model for object counting, T-Rex) can count the number of fruit bodies (coffee cherries) in 100 images. The foundation model with few-shot learning outperformed the trained YOLOv8 model (R2 = 0.923 and 0.900, respectively). ChatGPT also showed some interesting potential, especially when few-shot learning with human feedback was applied (R2 = 0.360 and 0.460, respectively). Moreover, we examined the time required for implementation as a practical question. Obtaining the results with the foundation model and ChatGPT were much shorter than the YOLOv8 model (0.83 hrs, 1.75 hrs, and 161 hrs). We interpret these results as two surprises for deep learning users in applied domains: a foundation model with few-shot domain-specific learning can drastically save time and effort compared to the conventional approach, and ChatGPT can reveal a relatively good performance. Both approaches do not need coding skills, which can foster AI education and dissemination.

- **Summary**: To make sense of their surroundings, intelligent systems must transform complex sensory inputs to structured codes that are reduced to task-relevant information such as object category. Biological agents achieve this in a largely autonomous manner, presumably via self-\allowbreak super-\allowbreak vised learning. Whereas previous attempts to model the underlying mechanisms were largely discriminative in nature, there is ample evidence that the brain employs a generative model of the world. Here, we propose that eye movements, in combination with the focused nature of primate vision, constitute a generative, self-supervised task of predicting and revealing visual information. We construct a proof-of-principle model starting from the framework of masked image modeling (MIM), a common approach in deep representation learning. To do so, we analyze how core components of MIM such as masking technique and data augmentation influence the formation of category-specific representations. This allows us not only to better understand the principles behind MIM, but to then reassemble a MIM more in line with the focused nature of biological perception. From a theoretical angle, we find that MIM disentangles neurons in latent space, a property that has been suggested to structure visual representations in primates, without explicit regulation. Together with previous findings of invariance learning, this highlights an interesting connection of MIM to latent regularization approaches for self-supervised learning.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) is a challenging task. Generating fine-grained pseudo-labels based on weak-label and then self-training a classifier is currently a promising solution. However, since the existing methods use only RGB visual modality and the utilization of category text information is neglected, thus limiting the generation of more accurate pseudo-labels and affecting the performance of self-training. Inspired by the manual labeling process based on the event description, in this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-label generation and self-training framework based on Text Prompt with Normality Guidance (TPWNG) for WSVAD. Our idea is to transfer the rich language-visual knowledge of the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model for aligning the video event description text and corresponding video frames to generate pseudo-labels. Specifically, We first fine-tune the CLIP for domain adaptation by designing two ranking losses and a distributional inconsistency loss. Further, we propose a learnable text prompt mechanism with the assist of a normality visual prompt to further improve the matching accuracy of video event description text and video frames. Then, we design a pseudo-label generation module based on the normality guidance to infer reliable frame-level pseudo-labels. Finally, we introduce a temporal context self-adaptive learning module to learn the temporal dependencies of different video events more flexibly and accurately. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, UCF-Crime and XD-Viole

- **Summary**: Contrastive learning has gained widespread adoption for retrieval tasks due to its minimal requirement for manual annotations. However, popular contrastive frameworks typically learn from binary relevance, making them ineffective at incorporating direct fine-grained rankings. In this paper, we curate a large-scale dataset featuring detailed relevance scores for each query-document pair to facilitate future research and evaluation. Subsequently, we propose Generalized Contrastive Learning for Multi-Modal Retrieval and Ranking (GCL), which is designed to learn from fine-grained rankings beyond binary relevance scores. Our results show that GCL achieves a 94.5% increase in NDCG@10 for in-domain and 26.3 to 48.8% increases for cold-start evaluations, all relative to the CLIP baseline and involving ground truth rankings.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have been made by incorporating natural language as additional guidance. Although yielding impressive results, the impact of the language prior, particularly in terms of generalization and robustness, remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate "low-level" sentences that convey object-centric, three-dimensional spatial relationships, incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data, these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally, to provide a foundation for future research, we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings. With an increasing number of methods using language for depth estimation, our findings highlight the opportunities and pitfalls that require careful consideration for effective deployment in real-world settings

- **Summary**: This study explores object detection in historical aerial photographs of Namibia to identify long-term environmental changes. Specifically, we aim to identify key objects -- \textit{Waterholes}, \textit{Omuti homesteads}, and \textit{Big trees} -- around Oshikango in Namibia using sub-meter gray-scale aerial imagery from 1943 and 1972. In this work, we propose a workflow for analyzing historical aerial imagery using a deep semantic segmentation model on sparse hand-labels. To this end, we employ a number of strategies including class-weighting, pseudo-labeling and empirical p-value-based filtering to balance skewed and sparse representations of objects in the ground truth data. Results demonstrate the benefits of these different training strategies resulting in an average $F_1=0.661$ and $F_1=0.755$ over the three objects of interest for the 1943 and 1972 imagery, respectively. We also identified that the average size of Waterhole and Big trees increased while the average size of Omutis decreased between 1943 and 1972 reflecting some of the local effects of the massive post-Second World War economic, agricultural, demographic, and environmental changes. This work also highlights the untapped potential of historical aerial photographs in understanding long-term environmental changes beyond Namibia (and Africa). With the lack of adequate satellite technology in the past, archival aerial photography offers a great alternative to uncover decades-long environmental changes.

- **Summary**: Cell segmentation is essential in biomedical research for analyzing cellular morphology and behavior. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have revolutionized cell segmentation by extracting intricate features from images. However, the robustness of these methods under microscope optical aberrations remains a critical challenge. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of cell instance segmentation models under simulated aberration conditions using the DynamicNuclearNet (DNN) and LIVECell datasets. Aberrations, including Astigmatism, Coma, Spherical, and Trefoil, were simulated using Zernike polynomial equations. Various segmentation models, such as Mask R-CNN with different network heads (FPN, C3) and backbones (ResNet, VGG19, SwinS), were trained and tested under aberrated conditions. Results indicate that FPN combined with SwinS demonstrates superior robustness in handling simple cell images affected by minor aberrations. Conversely, Cellpose2.0 proves effective for complex cell images under similar conditions. Our findings provide insights into selecting appropriate segmentation models based on cell morphology and aberration severity, enhancing the reliability of cell segmentation in biomedical applications. Further research is warranted to validate these methods with diverse aberration types and emerging segmentation models. Overall, this research aims to guide researchers in effectively utilizing cell segmentation models in the presence of minor optical aberrations.

- **Summary**: Computer vision models trained on Google Street View images can create material cadastres. However, current approaches need manually annotated datasets that are difficult to obtain and often have class imbalance. To address these challenges, this paper fine-tuned a Swin Transformer model on a synthetic dataset generated with DALL-E and compared the performance to a similar manually annotated dataset. Although manual annotation remains the gold standard, the synthetic dataset performance demonstrates a reasonable alternative. The findings will ease annotation needed to develop material cadastres, offering architects insights into opportunities for material reuse, thus contributing to the reduction of demolition waste.

- **Summary**: Intelligent vehicle systems require a deep understanding of the interplay between road conditions, surrounding entities, and the ego vehicle's driving behavior for safe and efficient navigation. This is particularly critical in developing countries where traffic situations are often dense and unstructured with heterogeneous road occupants. Existing datasets, predominantly geared towards structured and sparse traffic scenarios, fall short of capturing the complexity of driving in such environments. To fill this gap, we present IDD-X, a large-scale dual-view driving video dataset. With 697K bounding boxes, 9K important object tracks, and 1-12 objects per video, IDD-X offers comprehensive ego-relative annotations for multiple important road objects covering 10 categories and 19 explanation label categories. The dataset also incorporates rearview information to provide a more complete representation of the driving environment. We also introduce custom-designed deep networks aimed at multiple important object localization and per-object explanation prediction. Overall, our dataset and introduced prediction models form the foundation for studying how road conditions and surrounding entities affect driving behavior in complex traffic situations.

- **Summary**: Incorporating diffusion models in the image compression domain has the potential to produce realistic and detailed reconstructions, especially at extremely low bitrates. Previous methods focus on using diffusion models as expressive decoders robust to quantization errors in the conditioning signals, yet achieving competitive results in this manner requires costly training of the diffusion model and long inference times due to the iterative generative process. In this work we formulate the removal of quantization error as a denoising task, using diffusion to recover lost information in the transmitted image latent. Our approach allows us to perform less than 10\% of the full diffusion generative process and requires no architectural changes to the diffusion model, enabling the use of foundation models as a strong prior without additional fine tuning of the backbone. Our proposed codec outperforms previous methods in quantitative realism metrics, and we verify that our reconstructions are qualitatively preferred by end users, even when other methods use twice the bitrate.

- **Summary**: In the realm of fashion object detection and segmentation for online shopping images, existing state-of-the-art fashion parsing models encounter limitations, particularly when exposed to non-model-worn apparel and close-up shots. To address these failures, we introduce FashionFail; a new fashion dataset with e-commerce images for object detection and segmentation. The dataset is efficiently curated using our novel annotation tool that leverages recent foundation models. The primary objective of FashionFail is to serve as a test bed for evaluating the robustness of models. Our analysis reveals the shortcomings of leading models, such as Attribute-Mask R-CNN and Fashionformer. Additionally, we propose a baseline approach using naive data augmentation to mitigate common failure cases and improve model robustness. Through this work, we aim to inspire and support further research in fashion item detection and segmentation for industrial applications. The dataset, annotation tool, code, and models are available at \url{https://rizavelioglu.github.io/fashionfail/}.

- **Summary**: Medical image processing usually requires a model trained with carefully crafted datasets due to unique image characteristics and domain-specific challenges, especially in pathology. Primitive detection and segmentation in digitized tissue samples are essential for objective and automated diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. SAM (Segment Anything Model) has recently been developed to segment general objects from natural images with high accuracy, but it requires human prompts to generate masks. In this work, we present a novel approach that adapts pre-trained natural image encoders of SAM for detection-based region proposals. Regions proposed by a pre-trained encoder are sent to cascaded feature propagation layers for projection. Then, local semantic and global context is aggregated from multi-scale for bounding box localization and classification. Finally, the SAM decoder uses the identified bounding boxes as essential prompts to generate a comprehensive primitive segmentation map. The entire base framework, SAM, requires no additional training or fine-tuning but could produce an end-to-end result for two fundamental segmentation tasks in pathology. Our method compares with state-of-the-art models in F1 score for nuclei detection and binary/multiclass panoptic(bPQ/mPQ) and mask quality(dice) for segmentation quality on the PanNuke dataset while offering end-to-end efficiency. Our model also achieves remarkable Average Precision (+4.5%) on the secondary dataset (HuBMAP Kidney) compared to Faster RCNN.

- **Summary**: In recent years, we have seen many advancements in wood species identification. Methods like DNA analysis, Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, and Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) mass spectrometry complement the long-established wood anatomical assessment of cell and tissue morphology. However, most of these methods have some limitations such as high costs, the need for skilled experts for data interpretation, and the lack of good datasets for professional reference. Therefore, most of these methods, and certainly the wood anatomical assessment, may benefit from tools based on Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we apply two transfer learning techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a multi-view Congolese wood species dataset including sections from different orientations and viewed at different microscopic magnifications. We explore two feature extraction methods in detail, namely Global Average Pooling (GAP) and Random Encoding of Aggregated Deep Activation Maps (RADAM), for efficient and accurate wood species identification. Our results indicate superior accuracy on diverse datasets and anatomical sections, surpassing the results of other methods. Our proposal represents a significant advancement in wood species identification, offering a robust tool to support the conservation of forest ecosystems and promote sustainable forestry practices.

- **Summary**: Visual question answering (VQA) is known as an AI-complete task as it requires understanding, reasoning, and inferring about the vision and the language content. Over the past few years, numerous neural architectures have been suggested for the VQA problem. However, achieving success in zero-shot VQA remains a challenge due to its requirement for advanced generalization and reasoning skills. This study explores the impact of incorporating image captioning as an intermediary process within the VQA pipeline. Specifically, we explore the efficacy of utilizing image captions instead of images and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to establish a zero-shot setting. Since image captioning is the most crucial step in this process, we compare the impact of state-of-the-art image captioning models on VQA performance across various question types in terms of structure and semantics. We propose a straightforward and efficient question-driven image captioning approach within this pipeline to transfer contextual information into the question-answering (QA) model. This method involves extracting keywords from the question, generating a caption for each image-question pair using the keywords, and incorporating the question-driven caption into the LLM prompt. We evaluate the efficacy of using general-purpose and question-driven image captions in the VQA pipeline. Our study highlights the potential of employing image captions and harnessing the capabilities of LLMs to achieve competitive performance on GQA under the zero-shot setting.

- **Summary**: Referring image segmentation is a challenging task that involves generating pixel-wise segmentation masks based on natural language descriptions. Existing methods have relied mostly on visual features to generate the segmentation masks while treating text features as supporting components. This over-reliance on visual features can lead to suboptimal results, especially in complex scenarios where text prompts are ambiguous or context-dependent. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel framework VATEX to improve referring image segmentation by enhancing object and context understanding with Vision-Aware Text Feature. Our method involves using CLIP to derive a CLIP Prior that integrates an object-centric visual heatmap with text description, which can be used as the initial query in DETR-based architecture for the segmentation task. Furthermore, by observing that there are multiple ways to describe an instance in an image, we enforce feature similarity between text variations referring to the same visual input by two components: a novel Contextual Multimodal Decoder that turns text embeddings into vision-aware text features, and a Meaning Consistency Constraint to ensure further the coherent and consistent interpretation of language expressions with the context understanding obtained from the image. Our method achieves a significant performance improvement on three benchmark datasets RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and G-Ref. Code is available at: https://nero1342.github.io/VATEX\_RIS.



### Training-free Boost for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection with Confidence Aggregation

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) aims at localizing and recognizing visual objects from novel classes unseen at the training time. Whereas, empirical studies reveal that advanced detectors generally assign lower scores to those novel instances, which are inadvertently suppressed during inference by commonly adopted greedy strategies like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), leading to sub-optimal detection performance for novel classes. This paper systematically investigates this problem with the commonly-adopted two-stage OVOD paradigm. Specifically, in the region-proposal stage, proposals that contain novel instances showcase lower objectness scores, since they are treated as background proposals during the training phase. Meanwhile, in the object-classification stage, novel objects share lower region-text similarities (i.e., classification scores) due to the biased visual-language alignment by seen training samples. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces two advanced measures to adjust confidence scores and conserve erroneously dismissed objects: (1) a class-agnostic localization quality estimate via overlap degree of region/object proposals, and (2) a text-guided visual similarity estimate with proxy prototypes for novel classes. Integrated with adjusting techniques specifically designed for the region-proposal and object-classification stages, this paper derives the aggregated confidence estimate for the open-vocabulary object detection paradigm (AggDet). Our AggDet is a generic and training-free post-processing scheme, which consistently bolsters open-vocabulary detectors across model scales and architecture designs. For instance, AggDet receives 3.3% and 1.5% gains on OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks respectively, without any training cost.

- **Summary**: $\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect. Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831). LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2. Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2. Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements. We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis. $\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P<0.01). For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772. In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. $\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net achieved high performance in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in large-scale pretraining have yielded visual foundation models with strong capabilities. Not only can recent models generalize to arbitrary images for their training task, their intermediate representations are useful for other visual tasks such as detection and segmentation. Given that such models can classify, delineate, and localize objects in 2D, we ask whether they also represent their 3D structure? In this work, we analyze the 3D awareness of visual foundation models. We posit that 3D awareness implies that representations (1) encode the 3D structure of the scene and (2) consistently represent the surface across views. We conduct a series of experiments using task-specific probes and zero-shot inference procedures on frozen features. Our experiments reveal several limitations of the current models.

- **Summary**: In recent decades, the vision community has witnessed remarkable progress in visual recognition, partially owing to advancements in dataset benchmarks. Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. However, the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen comparatively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for thing instances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel annotations for stuff regions, which were subsequently heuristically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation annotations. These annotations, executed by different groups of raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by human raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks.

- **Summary**: Monocular egocentric 3D human motion capture is a challenging and actively researched problem. Existing methods use synchronously operating visual sensors (e.g. RGB cameras) and often fail under low lighting and fast motions, which can be restricting in many applications involving head-mounted devices. In response to the existing limitations, this paper 1) introduces a new problem, i.e., 3D human motion capture from an egocentric monocular event camera with a fisheye lens, and 2) proposes the first approach to it called EventEgo3D (EE3D). Event streams have high temporal resolution and provide reliable cues for 3D human motion capture under high-speed human motions and rapidly changing illumination. The proposed EE3D framework is specifically tailored for learning with event streams in the LNES representation, enabling high 3D reconstruction accuracy. We also design a prototype of a mobile head-mounted device with an event camera and record a real dataset with event observations and the ground-truth 3D human poses (in addition to the synthetic dataset). Our EE3D demonstrates robustness and superior 3D accuracy compared to existing solutions across various challenging experiments while supporting real-time 3D pose update rates of 140Hz.

- **Summary**: In Generalized Few-shot Segmentation (GFSS), a model is trained with a large corpus of base class samples and then adapted on limited samples of novel classes. This paper focuses on the relevance between base and novel classes, and improves GFSS in two aspects: 1) mining the similarity between base and novel classes to promote the learning of novel classes, and 2) mitigating the class imbalance issue caused by the volume difference between the support set and the training set. Specifically, we first propose a similarity transition matrix to guide the learning of novel classes with base class knowledge. Then, we leverage the Label-Distribution-Aware Margin (LDAM) loss and Transductive Inference to the GFSS task to address the problem of class imbalance as well as overfitting the support set. In addition, by extending the probability transition matrix, the proposed method can mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of base classes when learning novel classes. With a simple training phase, our proposed method can be applied to any segmentation network trained on base classes. We validated our methods on the adapted version of OpenEarthMap. Compared to existing GFSS baselines, our method excels them all from 3% to 7% and ranks second in the OpenEarthMap Land Cover Mapping Few-Shot Challenge at the completion of this paper.

- **Summary**: Artificial neural networks are often used to identify features of crop plants. However, training their models requires many annotated images, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Procedural models of plants, such as those developed with Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) can be created to produce visually realistic simulations, and hence images of plant simulations, where annotations are implicitly known. These synthetic images can either augment or completely replace real images in training neural networks for phenotyping tasks. In this paper, we systematically vary amounts of real and synthetic images used for training in both maize and canola to better understand situations where synthetic images generated from L-systems can help prediction on real images. This work also explores the degree to which realism in the synthetic images improves prediction. Furthermore, we see how neural network predictions can be used to help calibrate L-systems themselves, creating a feedback loop.

- **Summary**: The manual extraction method of Agarwood resinous compound is laborious work, requires skilled workers, and is subject to human errors. Commercial Agarwood industries have been actively exploring using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines to replace human effort for this particular task. The CNC machine accepts a G-code script produced from a binary image in which the wood region that needs to be chiselled off is marked with (0, 0, 0) as its RGB value. Rather than requiring a human expert to perform the region marking, we propose using a Deep learning image segmentation method instead. Our setup involves a camera that captures the cross-section image and then passes the image file to a computer. The computer performs the automated image segmentation and feeds the CNC machine with a G-code script. In this article, we report the initial segmentation results achieved using a state-of-the-art Deep learning segmentation method and discuss potential improvements to refine the segmentation accuracy.

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel concept of path consistency to learn robust object matching without using manual object identity supervision. Our key idea is that, to track a object through frames, we can obtain multiple different association results from a model by varying the frames it can observe, i.e., skipping frames in observation. As the differences in observations do not alter the identities of objects, the obtained association results should be consistent. Based on this rationale, we generate multiple observation paths, each specifying a different set of frames to be skipped, and formulate the Path Consistency Loss that enforces the association results are consistent across different observation paths. We use the proposed loss to train our object matching model with only self-supervision. By extensive experiments on three tracking datasets (MOT17, PersonPath22, KITTI), we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised methods with consistent margins on various evaluation metrics, and even achieves performance close to supervised methods.

- **Summary**: Accurate 3D object detection is crucial to autonomous driving. Though LiDAR-based detectors have achieved impressive performance, the high cost of LiDAR sensors precludes their widespread adoption in affordable vehicles. Camera-based detectors are cheaper alternatives but often suffer inferior performance compared to their LiDAR-based counterparts due to inherent depth ambiguities in images. In this work, we seek to improve monocular 3D detectors by leveraging unlabeled historical LiDAR data. Specifically, at inference time, we assume that the camera-based detectors have access to multiple unlabeled LiDAR scans from past traversals at locations of interest (potentially from other high-end vehicles equipped with LiDAR sensors). Under this setup, we proposed a novel, simple, and end-to-end trainable framework, termed AsyncDepth, to effectively extract relevant features from asynchronous LiDAR traversals of the same location for monocular 3D detectors. We show consistent and significant performance gain (up to 9 AP) across multiple state-of-the-art models and datasets with a negligible additional latency of 9.66 ms and a small storage cost.

- **Summary**: Medical documentation, including discharge notes, is crucial for ensuring patient care quality, continuity, and effective medical communication. However, the manual creation of these documents is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies and potential errors. The automation of this documentation process using artificial intelligence (AI) represents a promising area of innovation in healthcare. This study directly addresses the inefficiencies and inaccuracies in creating discharge notes manually, particularly for cardiac patients, by employing AI techniques, specifically large language model (LLM). Utilizing a substantial dataset from a cardiology center, encompassing wide-ranging medical records and physician assessments, our research evaluates the capability of LLM to enhance the documentation process. Among the various models assessed, Mistral-7B distinguished itself by accurately generating discharge notes that significantly improve both documentation efficiency and the continuity of care for patients. These notes underwent rigorous qualitative evaluation by medical expert, receiving high marks for their clinical relevance, completeness, readability, and contribution to informed decision-making and care planning. Coupled with quantitative analyses, these results confirm Mistral-7B's efficacy in distilling complex medical information into concise, coherent summaries. Overall, our findings illuminate the considerable promise of specialized LLM, such as Mistral-7B, in refining healthcare documentation workflows and advancing patient care. This study lays the groundwork for further integrating advanced AI technologies in healthcare, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize patient documentation and support better care outcomes.



### UniMix: Towards Domain Adaptive and Generalizable LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather

- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) is a critical task in autonomous driving and has achieved promising progress. However, prior LSS methods are conventionally investigated and evaluated on datasets within the same domain in clear weather. The robustness of LSS models in unseen scenes and all weather conditions is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in real applications. To this end, we propose UniMix, a universal method that enhances the adaptability and generalizability of LSS models. UniMix first leverages physically valid adverse weather simulation to construct a Bridge Domain, which serves to bridge the domain gap between the clear weather scenes and the adverse weather scenes. Then, a Universal Mixing operator is defined regarding spatial, intensity, and semantic distributions to create the intermediate domain with mixed samples from given domains. Integrating the proposed two techniques into a teacher-student framework, UniMix efficiently mitigates the domain gap and enables LSS models to learn weather-robust and domain-invariant representations. We devote UniMix to two main setups: 1) unsupervised domain adaption, adapting the model from the clear weather source domain to the adverse weather target domain; 2) domain generalization, learning a model that generalizes well to unseen scenes in adverse weather. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UniMix across different tasks and datasets, all achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released.

- **Summary**: In this work, we pioneer Semantic Flow, a neural semantic representation of dynamic scenes from monocular videos. In contrast to previous NeRF methods that reconstruct dynamic scenes from the colors and volume densities of individual points, Semantic Flow learns semantics from continuous flows that contain rich 3D motion information. As there is 2D-to-3D ambiguity problem in the viewing direction when extracting 3D flow features from 2D video frames, we consider the volume densities as opacity priors that describe the contributions of flow features to the semantics on the frames. More specifically, we first learn a flow network to predict flows in the dynamic scene, and propose a flow feature aggregation module to extract flow features from video frames. Then, we propose a flow attention module to extract motion information from flow features, which is followed by a semantic network to output semantic logits of flows. We integrate the logits with volume densities in the viewing direction to supervise the flow features with semantic labels on video frames. Experimental results show that our model is able to learn from multiple dynamic scenes and supports a series of new tasks such as instance-level scene editing, semantic completions, dynamic scene tracking and semantic adaption on novel scenes.

- **Summary**: Due to the complexity of medical image acquisition and the difficulty of annotation, medical image datasets inevitably contain noise. Noisy data with wrong labels affects the robustness and generalization ability of deep neural networks. Previous noise learning methods mainly considered noise arising from images being mislabeled, i.e. label noise, assuming that all mislabeled images are of high image quality. However, medical images are prone to suffering extreme quality issues, i.e. data noise, where discriminative visual features are missing for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a noise learning framework, termed as QMix, that learns a robust disease diagnosis model under mixed noise. QMix alternates between sample separation and quality-aware semisupervised training in each training epoch. In the sample separation phase, we design a joint uncertainty-loss criterion to effectively separate (1) correctly labeled images; (2) mislabeled images with high quality and (3) mislabeled images with low quality. In the semi-supervised training phase, we train a disease diagnosis model to learn robust feature representation from the separated samples. Specifically, we devise a sample-reweighing loss to mitigate the effect of mislabeled images with low quality during training. Meanwhile, a contrastive enhancement loss is proposed to further distinguish mislabeled images with low quality from correctly labeled images. QMix achieved state-of-the-art disease diagnosis performance on five public retinal image datasets and exhibited substantial improvement on robustness against mixed noise.

- **Summary**: Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technology is increasingly recognized as a pivotal solution in the global pursuit of clean and renewable energy. This technology addresses the urgent need for sustainable energy alternatives by converting solar power into electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. It not only curtails global carbon emissions but also reduces reliance on finite, non-renewable energy sources. In this context, monitoring solar panel farms becomes essential for understanding and facilitating the worldwide shift toward clean energy. This study contributes to this effort by developing the first comprehensive global dataset of multispectral satellite imagery of solar panel farms. This dataset is intended to form the basis for training robust machine learning models, which can accurately map and analyze the expansion and distribution of solar panel farms globally. The insights gained from this endeavor will be instrumental in guiding informed decision-making for a sustainable energy future. https://github.com/yzyly1992/GloSoFarID

- **Summary**: Deep learning has recently demonstrated its excellent performance on the task of multi-view stereo (MVS). However, loss functions applied for deep MVS are rarely studied. In this paper, we first analyze existing loss functions' properties for deep depth based MVS approaches. Regression based loss leads to inaccurate continuous results by computing mathematical expectation, while classification based loss outputs discretized depth values. To this end, we then propose a novel loss function, named adaptive Wasserstein loss, which is able to narrow down the difference between the true and predicted probability distributions of depth. Besides, a simple but effective offset module is introduced to better achieve sub-pixel prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks, including DTU, Tanks and Temples and BlendedMVS, show that the proposed method with the adaptive Wasserstein loss and the offset module achieves state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Traditional defect classification approaches are facing with two barriers. (1) Insufficient training data and unstable data quality. Collecting sufficient defective sample is expensive and time-costing, consequently leading to dataset variance. It introduces the difficulty on recognition and learning. (2) Over-dependence on visual modality. When the image pattern and texture is monotonic for all defect classes in a given dataset, the performance of conventional AOI system cannot be guaranteed. In scenarios where image quality is compromised due to mechanical failures or when defect information is inherently difficult to discern, the performance of deep models cannot be guaranteed. A main question is, "how to solve those two problems when they occur at the same time?" The feasible strategy is to explore another feature within dataset and combine an eminent vision-language model (VLM) and Large-Language model (LLM) with their astonishing zero-shot capability. In this work, we propose the special ASE dataset, including rich data description recorded on image, for defect classification, but the defect feature is uneasy to learn directly. Secondly, We present the prompting for VLM-LLM against defect classification with the proposed ASE dataset to activate extra-modality feature from images to enhance performance. Then, We design the novel progressive feature alignment (PFA) block to refine image-text feature to alleviate the difficulty of alignment under few-shot scenario. Finally, the proposed Cross-modality attention fusion (CMAF) module can effectively fuse different modality feature. Experiment results have demonstrated our method's effectiveness over several defect classification methods for the ASE dataset.

- **Summary**: Implicit reconstruction of ESDF (Euclidean Signed Distance Field) involves training a neural network to regress the signed distance from any point to the nearest obstacle, which has the advantages of lightweight storage and continuous querying. However, existing algorithms usually rely on conflicting raw observations as training data, resulting in poor map performance. In this paper, we propose LGSDF, an ESDF continual Global learning algorithm aided by Local updating. At the front end, axis-aligned grids are dynamically updated by pre-processed sensor observations, where incremental fusion alleviates estimation error caused by limited viewing directions. At the back end, a randomly initialized implicit ESDF neural network performs continual self-supervised learning guided by these grids to generate smooth and continuous maps. The results on multiple scenes show that LGSDF can construct more accurate ESDF maps and meshes compared with SOTA (State Of The Art) explicit and implicit mapping algorithms.

- **Summary**: While the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture gains prominence in computer vision and attracts significant attention from multimedia communities, its deficiency in prior knowledge (inductive bias) regarding shift, scale, and rotational invariance necessitates pre-training on large-scale datasets. Furthermore, the growing layers and parameters in both ViT and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) impede their applicability to mobile multimedia services, primarily owing to the constrained computational resources on edge devices. To mitigate the aforementioned challenges, this paper introduces a novel horizontally scalable vision transformer (HSViT). Specifically, a novel image-level feature embedding allows ViT to better leverage the inductive bias inherent in the convolutional layers. Based on this, an innovative horizontally scalable architecture is designed, which reduces the number of layers and parameters of the models while facilitating collaborative training and inference of ViT models across multiple nodes. The experimental results depict that, without pre-training on large-scale datasets, HSViT achieves up to 10% higher top-1 accuracy than state-of-the-art schemes, ascertaining its superior preservation of inductive bias.

- **Summary**: Given the irrevocability of biometric samples and mounting privacy concerns, biometric template security and secure matching are among the essential features of any well-designed modern biometric system. In this paper, we propose an obfuscation method that hides the biometric template information with just enough chaff. The main idea is to reduce the number of chaff points to a practical level by creating n sub-templates from the original template and hiding each sub-template with m chaff points. During verification, s closest vectors to the biometric query are retrieved from each vault and then combined to generate hash values that are compared with the stored hash value. We demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic facial images, generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), as ``random chaff points'' within a secure-vault authorization system. This approach safeguards user identities during training and deployment. We tested our protocol using the AT&T, GT, and LFW face datasets, with the ROC areas under the curve being 0.99, 0.99, and 0.90, respectively. These numbers were close to those of the unprotected templates, showing that our method does not adversely affect accuracy.

- **Summary**: We propose a novel self-supervised embedding to learn how actions sound from narrated in-the-wild egocentric videos. Whereas existing methods rely on curated data with known audio-visual correspondence, our multimodal contrastive-consensus coding (MC3) embedding reinforces the associations between audio, language, and vision when all modality pairs agree, while diminishing those associations when any one pair does not. We show our approach can successfully discover how the long tail of human actions sound from egocentric video, outperforming an array of recent multimodal embedding techniques on two datasets (Ego4D and EPIC-Sounds) and multiple cross-modal tasks.

- **Summary**: Recent progress has shown great potential of visual prompt tuning (VPT) when adapting pre-trained vision transformers to various downstream tasks. However, most existing solutions independently optimize prompts at each layer, thereby neglecting the usage of task-relevant information encoded in prompt tokens across layers. Additionally, existing prompt structures are prone to interference from task-irrelevant noise in input images, which can do harm to the sharing of task-relevant information. In this paper, we propose a novel VPT approach, \textbf{iVPT}. It innovatively incorporates a cross-layer dynamic connection (CDC) for input prompt tokens from adjacent layers, enabling effective sharing of task-relevant information. Furthermore, we design a dynamic aggregation (DA) module that facilitates selective sharing of information between layers. The combination of CDC and DA enhances the flexibility of the attention process within the VPT framework. Building upon these foundations, iVPT introduces an attentive reinforcement (AR) mechanism, by automatically identifying salient image tokens, which are further enhanced by prompt tokens in an additive manner. Extensive experiments on 24 image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed iVPT, compared to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

- **Summary**: The transformer is a powerful data modelling framework responsible for remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks. However, they are limited in terms of scalability as it is suboptimal and inefficient to process long-sequence data. To this purpose we introduce BLRP (Bidirectional Long-Range Parser), a novel and versatile attention mechanism designed to increase performance and efficiency on long-sequence tasks. It leverages short and long range heuristics in the form of a local sliding window approach combined with a global bidirectional latent space synthesis technique. We show the benefits and versatility of our approach on vision and language domains by demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods on the Long-Range-Arena and CIFAR benchmarks together with ablations demonstrating the computational efficiency.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is a challenging task due to its high complexity. Despite subspace clustering shows impressive performance for HSI, traditional methods tend to ignore the global-local interaction in HSI data. In this study, we proposed a multi-level graph subspace contrastive learning (MLGSC) for HSI clustering. The model is divided into the following main parts. Graph convolution subspace construction: utilizing spectral and texture feautures to construct two graph convolution views. Local-global graph representation: local graph representations were obtained by step-by-step convolutions and a more representative global graph representation was obtained using an attention-based pooling strategy. Multi-level graph subspace contrastive learning: multi-level contrastive learning was conducted to obtain local-global joint graph representations, to improve the consistency of the positive samples between views, and to obtain more robust graph embeddings. Specifically, graph-level contrastive learning is used to better learn global representations of HSI data. Node-level intra-view and inter-view contrastive learning is designed to learn joint representations of local regions of HSI. The proposed model is evaluated on four popular HSI datasets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, Houston, and Xu Zhou. The overall accuracies are 97.75%, 99.96%, 92.28%, and 95.73%, which significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art clustering methods.

- **Summary**: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), with a vast number of native speakers, has profound influence on society and culture. The typesetting of CJK languages carries a wide range of requirements due to the complexity of their scripts and unique literary traditions. A critical aspect of this typesetting process is that CJK fonts need to provide a set of consistent-looking glyphs for approximately one hundred thousand characters. However, creating such a font is inherently labor-intensive and expensive, which significantly hampers the development of new CJK fonts for typesetting, historical, aesthetic, or artistic purposes.   To bridge this gap, we are motivated by recent advancements in diffusion-based generative models and propose a novel diffusion method for generating glyphs in a targeted style from a \emph{single} conditioned, standard glyph form. Our experiments show that our method is capable of generating fonts of both printed and hand-written styles, the latter of which presents a greater challenge. Moreover, our approach shows remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities for non-CJK but Chinese-inspired scripts. We also show our method facilitates smooth style interpolation and generates bitmap images suitable for vectorization, which is crucial in the font creation process. In summary, our proposed method opens the door to high-quality, generative model-assisted font creation for CJK characters, for both typesetting and artistic endeavors.

- **Summary**: Gaze is an essential prompt for analyzing human behavior and attention. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in determining gaze direction from facial videos. However, video gaze estimation faces significant challenges, such as understanding the dynamic evolution of gaze in video sequences, dealing with static backgrounds, and adapting to variations in illumination. To address these challenges, we propose a simple and novel deep learning model designed to estimate gaze from videos, incorporating a specialized attention module. Our method employs a spatial attention mechanism that tracks spatial dynamics within videos. This technique enables accurate gaze direction prediction through a temporal sequence model, adeptly transforming spatial observations into temporal insights, thereby significantly improving gaze estimation accuracy. Additionally, our approach integrates Gaussian processes to include individual-specific traits, facilitating the personalization of our model with just a few labeled samples. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach, demonstrating its success in both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Specifically, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gaze360 dataset, improving by $2.5^\circ$ without personalization. Further, by personalizing the model with just three samples, we achieved an additional improvement of $0.8^\circ$.

- **Summary**: Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/Jaewoo97/T2P.

- **Summary**: With the rapid development of XR, 3D generation and editing are becoming more and more important, among which, stylization is an important tool of 3D appearance editing. It can achieve consistent 3D artistic stylization given a single reference style image and thus is a user-friendly editing way. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods face efficiency issues that affect the actual user experience and the implicit nature limits its ability to transfer the geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to exert flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable, fostering an environment conducive to creative exploration. In this paper, we introduce StylizedGS, a 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. The 3DGS brings the benefits of high efficiency. We propose a GS filter to eliminate floaters in the reconstruction which affects the stylization effects before stylization. Then the nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale and regions during the stylization to possess customized capabilities. Our method can attain high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference FPS.

- **Summary**: Recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) or multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for document understanding has been proven very promising. However, previous works that employ LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding have not fully explored and utilized the document layout information, which is vital for precise document understanding. In this paper, we propose LayoutLLM, an LLM/MLLM based method for document understanding. The core of LayoutLLM is a layout instruction tuning strategy, which is specially designed to enhance the comprehension and utilization of document layouts. The proposed layout instruction tuning strategy consists of two components: Layout-aware Pre-training and Layout-aware Supervised Fine-tuning. To capture the characteristics of document layout in Layout-aware Pre-training, three groups of pre-training tasks, corresponding to document-level, region-level and segment-level information, are introduced. Furthermore, a novel module called layout chain-of-thought (LayoutCoT) is devised to enable LayoutLLM to focus on regions relevant to the question and generate accurate answers. LayoutCoT is effective for boosting the performance of document understanding. Meanwhile, it brings a certain degree of interpretability, which could facilitate manual inspection and correction. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the proposed LayoutLLM significantly outperforms existing methods that adopt open-source 7B LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding. The training data of the LayoutLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/AdvancedLiterateMachinery/tree/main/DocumentUnderstanding/LayoutLLM

- **Summary**: The vision-language model has brought great improvement to few-shot industrial anomaly detection, which usually needs to design of hundreds of prompts through prompt engineering. For automated scenarios, we first use conventional prompt learning with many-class paradigm as the baseline to automatically learn prompts but found that it can not work well in one-class anomaly detection. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a one-class prompt learning method for few-shot anomaly detection, termed PromptAD. First, we propose semantic concatenation which can transpose normal prompts into anomaly prompts by concatenating normal prompts with anomaly suffixes, thus constructing a large number of negative samples used to guide prompt learning in one-class setting. Furthermore, to mitigate the training challenge caused by the absence of anomaly images, we introduce the concept of explicit anomaly margin, which is used to explicitly control the margin between normal prompt features and anomaly prompt features through a hyper-parameter. For image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection, PromptAD achieves first place in 11/12 few-shot settings on MVTec and VisA.

- **Summary**: Recently, a surge of 3D style transfer methods has been proposed that leverage the scene reconstruction power of a pre-trained neural radiance field (NeRF). To successfully stylize a scene this way, one must first reconstruct a photo-realistic radiance field from collected images of the scene. However, when only sparse input views are available, pre-trained few-shot NeRFs often suffer from high-frequency artifacts, which are generated as a by-product of high-frequency details for improving reconstruction quality. Is it possible to generate more faithful stylized scenes from sparse inputs by directly optimizing encoding-based scene representation with target style? In this paper, we consider the stylization of sparse-view scenes in terms of disentangling content semantics and style textures. We propose a coarse-to-fine sparse-view scene stylization framework, where a novel hierarchical encoding-based neural representation is designed to generate high-quality stylized scenes directly from implicit scene representations. We also propose a new optimization strategy with content strength annealing to achieve realistic stylization and better content preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve high-quality stylization of sparse-view scenes and outperforms fine-tuning-based baselines in terms of stylization quality and efficiency.

- **Summary**: Via thousands of papers in Explainable AI (XAI), attention maps \cite{vaswani2017attention} and feature attribution maps \cite{bansal2020sam} have been established as a common means for explaining the input features that are important to AI's decisions. It is an interesting but unexplored question whether allowing users to edit the importance scores of input features at test time would improve the human-AI team's accuracy on downstream tasks. In this paper, we address this question by taking CHM-Corr, a state-of-the-art, ante-hoc explanation method \cite{taesiri2022visual} that first predicts patch-wise correspondences between the input and the training-set images, and then uses them to make classification decisions. We build an interactive interface on top of CHM-Corr, enabling users to directly edit the initial feature attribution map provided by CHM-Corr. Via our CHM-Corr++ interface, users gain insights into if, when, and how the model changes its outputs, enhancing understanding beyond static explanations. Our user study with 18 machine learning researchers who performed $\sim$1,400 decisions shows that our interactive approach does not improve user accuracy on CUB-200 bird image classification over static explanations. This challenges the belief that interactivity inherently boosts XAI effectiveness~\cite{sokol2020one,sun2022exploring,shen2024towards,singh2024rethinking,mindlin2024beyond,lakkaraju2022rethinking,cheng2019explaining,liu2021understanding} and raises needs for future research. Our work contributes to the field by open-sourcing an interactive tool for manipulating model attention, and it lays the groundwork for future research to enable effective human-AI interaction in computer vision.

- **Summary**: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve low-illumination images. However, existing methods face two challenges: (1) uncertainty in restoration from diverse brightness degradations; (2) loss of texture and color information caused by noise suppression and light enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel enhancement approach, CodeEnhance, by leveraging quantized priors and image refinement to address these challenges. In particular, we reframe LLIE as learning an image-to-code mapping from low-light images to discrete codebook, which has been learned from high-quality images. To enhance this process, a Semantic Embedding Module (SEM) is introduced to integrate semantic information with low-level features, and a Codebook Shift (CS) mechanism, designed to adapt the pre-learned codebook to better suit the distinct characteristics of our low-light dataset. Additionally, we present an Interactive Feature Transformation (IFT) module to refine texture and color information during image reconstruction, allowing for interactive enhancement based on user preferences. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that the incorporation of prior knowledge and controllable information transfer significantly enhances LLIE performance in terms of quality and fidelity. The proposed CodeEnhance exhibits superior robustness to various degradations, including uneven illumination, noise, and color distortion.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated their ability to synthesize visual images through natural language prompts. One approach of personalizing text-to-image models, exemplified by DreamBooth, fine-tunes the pre-trained model by binding unique text identifiers with a few images of a specific subject. Although existing fine-tuning methods have demonstrated competence in rendering images according to the styles of famous painters, it is still challenging to learn to produce images encapsulating distinct art styles due to abstract and broad visual perceptions of stylistic attributes such as lines, shapes, textures, and colors. In this paper, we introduce a new method, Single-StyleForge, for personalization. It fine-tunes pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to generate diverse images in specified styles from text prompts. By using around 15-20 images of the target style, the approach establishes a foundational binding of a unique token identifier with a broad range of the target style. It also utilizes auxiliary images to strengthen this binding, resulting in offering specific guidance on representing elements such as persons in a target style-consistent manner. In addition, we present ways to improve the quality of style and text-image alignment through a method called Multi-StyleForge, which inherits the strategy used in StyleForge and learns tokens in multiple. Experimental evaluation conducted on six distinct artistic styles demonstrates substantial improvements in both the quality of generated images and the perceptual fidelity metrics, such as FID, KID, and CLIP scores.

- **Summary**: Band selection in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is critical for optimising data processing and enhancing analytical accuracy. Traditional approaches have predominantly concentrated on analysing spectral and pixel characteristics within individual bands independently. These approaches overlook the potential benefits of integrating multiple data sources, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and is further challenged by the limited availability of labeled data in HSI processing, which represents a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel unsupervised band selection framework that incorporates attention mechanisms and an Autoencoder for reconstruction-based band selection. Our methodology distinctively integrates HSI with LiDAR data through an attention score, using a convolutional Autoencoder to process the combined feature mask. This fusion effectively captures essential spatial and spectral features and reduces redundancy in hyperspectral datasets. A comprehensive comparative analysis of our innovative fused band selection approach is performed against existing unsupervised band selection and fusion models. We used data sets such as Houston 2013, Trento, and MUUFLE for our experiments. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior classification accuracy and significantly outperforms existing models. This enhancement in HSI band selection, facilitated by the incorporation of LiDAR features, underscores the considerable advantages of integrating features from different sources.

- **Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities that increasingly influence various aspects of our daily lives, constantly defining the new boundary of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Image modalities, enriched with profound semantic information and a more continuous mathematical nature compared to other modalities, greatly enhance the functionalities of MLLMs when integrated. However, this integration serves as a double-edged sword, providing attackers with expansive vulnerabilities to exploit for highly covert and harmful attacks. The pursuit of reliable AI systems like powerful MLLMs has emerged as a pivotal area of contemporary research. In this paper, we endeavor to demostrate the multifaceted risks associated with the incorporation of image modalities into MLLMs. Initially, we delineate the foundational components and training processes of MLLMs. Subsequently, we construct a threat model, outlining the security vulnerabilities intrinsic to MLLMs. Moreover, we analyze and summarize existing scholarly discourses on MLLMs' attack and defense mechanisms, culminating in suggestions for the future research on MLLM security. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to deepen the academic understanding of MLLM security challenges and propel forward the development of trustworthy MLLM systems.

- **Summary**: Customized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize instantiations of user-specified concepts and has achieved unprecedented progress in handling individual concept. However, when extending to multiple customized concepts, existing methods exhibit limitations in terms of flexibility and fidelity, only accommodating the combination of limited types of models and potentially resulting in a mix of characteristics from different concepts. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-concept guidance for Multi-concept customization, termed MC$^2$, for improved flexibility and fidelity. MC$^2$ decouples the requirements for model architecture via inference time optimization, allowing the integration of various heterogeneous single-concept customized models. It adaptively refines the attention weights between visual and textual tokens, directing image regions to focus on their associated words while diminishing the impact of irrelevant ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MC$^2$ even surpasses previous methods that require additional training in terms of consistency with input prompt and reference images. Moreover, MC$^2$ can be extended to elevate the compositional capabilities of text-to-image generation, yielding appealing results. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JIANGJiaXiu/MC-2.

- **Summary**: Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) aims to capture a sequence of video frames with only a single shot of a 2D detector, whose backbones rest in optical modulation patterns (also known as masks) and a computational reconstruction algorithm. Advanced deep learning algorithms and mature hardware are putting video SCI into practical applications. Yet, there are two clouds in the sunshine of SCI: i) low dynamic range as a victim of high temporal multiplexing, and ii) existing deep learning algorithms' degradation on real system. To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep optics framework to jointly optimize masks and a reconstruction network. Specifically, we first propose a new type of structural mask to realize motion-aware and full-dynamic-range measurement. Considering the motion awareness property in measurement domain, we develop an efficient network for video SCI reconstruction using Transformer to capture long-term temporal dependencies, dubbed Res2former. Moreover, sensor response is introduced into the forward model of video SCI to guarantee end-to-end model training close to real system. Finally, we implement the learned structural masks on a digital micro-mirror device. Experimental results on synthetic and real data validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We believe this is a milestone for real-world video SCI. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/pwangcs/DeepOpticsSCI.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection based on roadside cameras is an additional way for autonomous driving to alleviate the challenges of occlusion and short perception range from vehicle cameras. Previous methods for roadside 3D object detection mainly focus on modeling the depth or height of objects, neglecting the stationary of cameras and the characteristic of inter-frame consistency. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely MOSE, for MOnocular 3D object detection with Scene cuEs. The scene cues are the frame-invariant scene-specific features, which are crucial for object localization and can be intuitively regarded as the height between the surface of the real road and the virtual ground plane. In the proposed framework, a scene cue bank is designed to aggregate scene cues from multiple frames of the same scene with a carefully designed extrinsic augmentation strategy. Then, a transformer-based decoder lifts the aggregated scene cues as well as the 3D position embeddings for 3D object location, which boosts generalization ability in heterologous scenes. The extensive experiment results on two public benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, which surpasses the existing methods by a large margin.

- **Summary**: Object detection is critical in autonomous driving, and it is more practical yet challenging to localize objects of unknown categories: an endeavour known as Class-Agnostic Object Detection (CAOD). Existing studies on CAOD predominantly rely on ordinary cameras, but these frame-based sensors usually have high latency and limited dynamic range, leading to safety risks in real-world scenarios. In this study, we turn to a new modality enabled by the so-called event camera, featured by its sub-millisecond latency and high dynamic range, for robust CAOD. We propose Detecting Every Object in Events (DEOE), an approach tailored for achieving high-speed, class-agnostic open-world object detection in event-based vision. Built upon the fast event-based backbone: recurrent vision transformer, we jointly consider the spatial and temporal consistencies to identify potential objects. The discovered potential objects are assimilated as soft positive samples to avoid being suppressed as background. Moreover, we introduce a disentangled objectness head to separate the foreground-background classification and novel object discovery tasks, enhancing the model's generalization in localizing novel objects while maintaining a strong ability to filter out the background. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our proposed DEOE in comparison with three strong baseline methods that integrate the state-of-the-art event-based object detector with advancements in RGB-based CAOD.

- **Summary**: Multiple benchmarks have been developed to assess the alignment between deep neural networks (DNNs) and human vision. In almost all cases these benchmarks are observational in the sense they are composed of behavioural and brain responses to naturalistic images that have not been manipulated to test hypotheses regarding how DNNs or humans perceive and identify objects. Here we introduce the toolbox MindSet: Vision, consisting of a collection of image datasets and related scripts designed to test DNNs on 30 psychological findings. In all experimental conditions, the stimuli are systematically manipulated to test specific hypotheses regarding human visual perception and object recognition. In addition to providing pre-generated datasets of images, we provide code to regenerate these datasets, offering many configurable parameters which greatly extend the dataset versatility for different research contexts, and code to facilitate the testing of DNNs on these image datasets using three different methods (similarity judgments, out-of-distribution classification, and decoder method), accessible at https://github.com/MindSetVision/mindset-vision. We test ResNet-152 on each of these methods as an example of how the toolbox can be used.

- **Summary**: Graves' disease is a common condition that is diagnosed clinically by determining the smoothness of the thyroid texture and its morphology in ultrasound images. Currently, the most widely used approach for the automated diagnosis of Graves' disease utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for both feature extraction and classification. However, these methods demonstrate limited efficacy in capturing texture features. Given the high capacity of wavelets in describing texture features, this research integrates learnable wavelet modules utilizing the Lifting Scheme into CNNs and incorporates a parallel wavelet branch into the ResNet18 model to enhance texture feature extraction. Our model can analyze texture features in spatial and frequency domains simultaneously, leading to optimized classification accuracy. We conducted experiments on collected ultrasound datasets and publicly available natural image texture datasets, our proposed network achieved 97.27% accuracy and 95.60% recall on ultrasound datasets, 60.765% accuracy on natural image texture datasets, surpassing the accuracy of ResNet and conrming the effectiveness of our approach.

- **Summary**: Autonomous driving technology is increasingly being used on public roads and in industrial settings such as mines. While it is essential to detect pedestrians, vehicles, or other obstacles, adverse field conditions negatively affect the performance of classical sensors such as cameras or lidars. Radar, on the other hand, is a promising modality that is less affected by, e.g., dust, smoke, water mist or fog. In particular, modern 4D imaging radars provide target responses across the range, vertical angle, horizontal angle and Doppler velocity dimensions. We propose TMVA4D, a CNN architecture that leverages this 4D radar modality for semantic segmentation. The CNN is trained to distinguish between the background and person classes based on a series of 2D projections of the 4D radar data that include the elevation, azimuth, range, and Doppler velocity dimensions. We also outline the process of compiling a novel dataset consisting of data collected in industrial settings with a car-mounted 4D radar and describe how the ground-truth labels were generated from reference thermal images. Using TMVA4D on this dataset, we achieve an mIoU score of 78.2% and an mDice score of 86.1%, evaluated on the two classes background and person

- **Summary**: Perception systems, especially cameras, are the eyes of automated driving systems. Ensuring that they function reliably and robustly is therefore an important building block in the automation of vehicles. There are various approaches to test the perception of automated driving systems. Ultimately, however, it always comes down to the investigation of the behavior of perception systems under specific input data. Camera images are a crucial part of the input data. Image data sets are therefore collected for the testing of automated driving systems, but it is non-trivial to find specific images in these data sets. Thanks to recent developments in neural networks, there are now methods for sorting the images in a data set according to their similarity to a prompt in natural language. In order to further automate the provision of search results, we make a contribution by automating the threshold definition in these sorted results and returning only the images relevant to the prompt as a result. Our focus is on preventing false positives and false negatives equally. It is also important that our method is robust and in the case that our assumptions are not fulfilled, we provide a fallback solution.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image generation has witnessed great progress, especially with the recent advancements in diffusion models. Since texts cannot provide detailed conditions like object appearance, reference images are usually leveraged for the control of objects in the generated images. However, existing methods still suffer limited accuracy when the relationship between the foreground and background is complicated. To address this issue, we develop a framework termed Mask-ControlNet by introducing an additional mask prompt. Specifically, we first employ large vision models to obtain masks to segment the objects of interest in the reference image. Then, the object images are employed as additional prompts to facilitate the diffusion model to better understand the relationship between foreground and background regions during image generation. Experiments show that the mask prompts enhance the controllability of the diffusion model to maintain higher fidelity to the reference image while achieving better image quality. Comparison with previous text-to-image generation methods demonstrates our method's superior quantitative and qualitative performance on the benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: The automation of games using Deep Reinforcement Learning Strategies (DRL) is a well-known challenge in AI research. While for feature extraction in a video game typically the whole image is used, this is hardly practical for many real world games. Instead, using a smaller game state reducing the dimension of the parameter space to include essential parameters only seems to be a promising approach. In the game of Foosball, a compact and comprehensive game state description consists of the positional shifts and rotations of the figures and the position of the ball over time. In particular, velocities and accelerations can be derived from consecutive time samples of the game state. In this paper, a figure detection system to determine the game state in Foosball is presented. We capture a dataset containing the rotations of the rods which were measured using accelerometers and the positional shifts were derived using traditional Computer Vision techniques (in a laboratory setting). This dataset is utilized to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based end-to-end regression models to predict the rotations and shifts of each rod. We present an evaluation of our system using different state-of-the-art CNNs as base architectures for the regression model. We show that our system is able to predict the game state with high accuracy. By providing data for both black and white teams, the presented system is intended to provide the required data for future developments of Imitation Learning techniques w.r.t. to observing human players.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces MAD-MIL, a Multi-head Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning model, designed for weakly supervised Whole Slide Images (WSIs) classification in digital pathology. Inspired by the multi-head attention mechanism of the Transformer, MAD-MIL simplifies model complexity while achieving competitive results against advanced models like CLAM and DS-MIL.

- **Summary**: In Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), we cluster unlabeled samples of known and novel classes, leveraging a training dataset of known classes. A salient challenge arises due to domain shifts between these datasets. To address this, we present a novel setting: Across Domain Generalized Category Discovery (AD-GCD) and bring forth CDAD-NET (Class Discoverer Across Domains) as a remedy. CDAD-NET is architected to synchronize potential known class samples across both the labeled (source) and unlabeled (target) datasets, while emphasizing the distinct categorization of the target data. To facilitate this, we propose an entropy-driven adversarial learning strategy that accounts for the distance distributions of target samples relative to source-domain class prototypes. Parallelly, the discriminative nature of the shared space is upheld through a fusion of three metric learning objectives. In the source domain, our focus is on refining the proximity between samples and their affiliated class prototypes, while in the target domain, we integrate a neighborhood-centric contrastive learning mechanism, enriched with an adept neighborsmining approach. To further accentuate the nuanced feature interrelation among semantically aligned images, we champion the concept of conditional image inpainting, underscoring the premise that semantically analogous images prove more efficacious to the task than their disjointed counterparts. Experimentally, CDAD-NET eclipses existing literature with a performance increment of 8-15% on three AD-GCD benchmarks we present.

- **Summary**: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been widely used in text-to-image diffusion models, where the CFG scale is introduced to control the strength of text guidance on the whole image space. However, we argue that a global CFG scale results in spatial inconsistency on varying semantic strengths and suboptimal image quality. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, Semantic-aware Classifier-Free Guidance (S-CFG), to customize the guidance degrees for different semantic units in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we first design a training-free semantic segmentation method to partition the latent image into relatively independent semantic regions at each denoising step. In particular, the cross-attention map in the denoising U-net backbone is renormalized for assigning each patch to the corresponding token, while the self-attention map is used to complete the semantic regions. Then, to balance the amplification of diverse semantic units, we adaptively adjust the CFG scales across different semantic regions to rescale the text guidance degrees into a uniform level. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S-CFG over the original CFG strategy on various text-to-image diffusion models, without requiring any extra training cost. our codes are available at https://github.com/SmilesDZgk/S-CFG.

- **Summary**: Beyond class frequency, we recognize the impact of class-wise relationships among various class-specific predictions and the imbalance in label masks on long-tailed segmentation learning. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Pixel-wise Adaptive Training (PAT) technique tailored for long-tailed segmentation. PAT has two key features: 1) class-wise gradient magnitude homogenization, and 2) pixel-wise class-specific loss adaptation (PCLA). First, the class-wise gradient magnitude homogenization helps alleviate the imbalance among label masks by ensuring equal consideration of the class-wise impact on model updates. Second, PCLA tackles the detrimental impact of both rare classes within the long-tailed distribution and inaccurate predictions from previous training stages by encouraging learning classes with low prediction confidence and guarding against forgetting classes with high confidence. This combined approach fosters robust learning while preventing the model from forgetting previously learned knowledge. PAT exhibits significant performance improvements, surpassing the current state-of-the-art by 2.2% in the NyU dataset. Moreover, it enhances overall pixel-wise accuracy by 2.85% and intersection over union value by 2.07%, with a particularly notable declination of 0.39% in detecting rare classes compared to Balance Logits Variation, as demonstrated on the three popular datasets, i.e., OxfordPetIII, CityScape, and NYU.

- **Summary**: For a unified analysis of medical images from different modalities, data harmonization using image-to-image (I2I) translation is desired. We study this problem employing an optical coherence tomography (OCT) data set of Spectralis-OCT and Home-OCT images. I2I translation is challenging because the images are unpaired, and a bijective mapping does not exist due to the information discrepancy between both domains. This problem has been addressed by the Contrastive Learning for Unpaired I2I Translation (CUT) approach, but it reduces semantic consistency. To restore the semantic consistency, we support the style decoder using an additional segmentation decoder. Our approach increases the similarity between the style-translated images and the target distribution. Importantly, we improve the segmentation of biomarkers in Home-OCT images in an unsupervised domain adaptation scenario. Our data harmonization approach provides potential for the monitoring of diseases, e.g., age related macular disease, using different OCT devices.

- **Summary**: 3D hand pose estimation from images has seen considerable interest from the literature, with new methods improving overall 3D accuracy. One current challenge is to address hand-to-hand interaction where self-occlusions and finger articulation pose a significant problem to estimation. Little work has applied physical constraints that minimize the hand intersections that occur as a result of noisy estimation. This work addresses the intersection of hands by exploiting an occupancy network that represents the hand's volume as a continuous manifold. This allows us to model the probability distribution of points being inside a hand. We designed an intersection loss function to minimize the likelihood of hand-to-point intersections. Moreover, we propose a new hand mesh parameterization that is superior to the commonly used MANO model in many respects including lower mesh complexity, underlying 3D skeleton extraction, watertightness, etc. On the benchmark InterHand2.6M dataset, the models trained using our intersection loss achieve better results than the state-of-the-art by significantly decreasing the number of hand intersections while lowering the mean per-joint positional error. Additionally, we demonstrate superior performance for 3D hand uplift on Re:InterHand and SMILE datasets and show reduced hand-to-hand intersections for complex domains such as sign-language pose estimation.

- **Summary**: Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization (ZS-TAL) seeks to identify and locate actions in untrimmed videos unseen during training. Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training data. While effective, training-based ZS-TAL approaches assume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning, which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore, the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the learned model, which may adversely affect the model's generalization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically novel perspective, relaxing the requirement for training data. To this aim, we introduce a novel method that performs Test-Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T3AL). In a nutshell, T3AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Language Model (VLM). T3AL operates in three steps. First, a video-level pseudo-label of the action category is computed by aggregating information from the entire video. Then, action localization is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-supervised learning. Finally, frame-level textual descriptions extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are employed for refining the action region proposals. We validate the effectiveness of T3AL by conducting experiments on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that T3AL significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines based on state-of-the-art VLMs, confirming the benefit of a test-time adaptation approach.

- **Summary**: Long-term video generation and prediction remain challenging tasks in computer vision, particularly in partially observable scenarios where cameras are mounted on moving platforms. The interaction between observed image frames and the motion of the recording agent introduces additional complexities. To address these issues, we introduce the Action-Conditioned Video Generation (ACVG) framework, a novel approach that investigates the relationship between actions and generated image frames through a deep dual Generator-Actor architecture. ACVG generates video sequences conditioned on the actions of robots, enabling exploration and analysis of how vision and action mutually influence one another in dynamic environments. We evaluate the framework's effectiveness on an indoor robot motion dataset which consists of sequences of image frames along with the sequences of actions taken by the robotic agent, conducting a comprehensive empirical study comparing ACVG to other state-of-the-art frameworks along with a detailed ablation study.

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral data recorded from satellite platforms are often ill-suited for geo-archaeological prospection due to low spatial resolution. The established potential of hyperspectral data from airborne sensors in identifying archaeological features has, on the other side, generated increased interest in enhancing hyperspectral data to achieve higher spatial resolution. This improvement is crucial for detecting traces linked to sub-surface geo-archaeological features and can make satellite hyperspectral acquisitions more suitable for archaeological research. This research assesses the usability of pansharpened PRISMA satellite products in geo-archaeological prospections. Three pan-sharpening methods (GSA, MTF-GLP and HySure) are compared quantitatively and qualitatively and tested over the archaeological landscape of Aquileia (Italy). The results suggest that the application of pansharpening techniques makes hyperspectral satellite imagery highly suitable, under certain conditions, to the identification of sub-surface archaeological features of small and large size.

- **Summary**: Combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with external specialized tools (LLMs+tools) is a recent paradigm to solve multimodal tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). While this approach was demonstrated to work well when optimized and evaluated for each individual benchmark, in practice it is crucial for the next generation of real-world AI systems to handle a broad range of multimodal problems. Therefore we pose the VQA problem from a unified perspective and evaluate a single system on a varied suite of VQA tasks including counting, spatial reasoning, OCR-based reasoning, visual pointing, external knowledge, and more. In this setting, we demonstrate that naively applying the LLM+tools approach using the combined set of all tools leads to poor results. This motivates us to introduce HAMMR: HierArchical MultiModal React. We start from a multimodal ReAct-based system and make it hierarchical by enabling our HAMMR agents to call upon other specialized agents. This enhances the compositionality of the LLM+tools approach, which we show to be critical for obtaining high accuracy on generic VQA. Concretely, on our generic VQA suite, HAMMR outperforms the naive LLM+tools approach by 19.5%. Additionally, HAMMR achieves state-of-the-art results on this task, outperforming the generic standalone PaLI-X VQA model by 5.0%.

- **Summary**: Automatic lip-reading (ALR) aims to automatically transcribe spoken content from a speaker's silent lip motion captured in video. Current mainstream lip-reading approaches only use a single visual encoder to model input videos of a single scale. In this paper, we propose to enhance lipreading by incorporating multi-scale video data and multi-encoder. Specifically, we first propose a novel multi-scale lip extraction algorithm based on the size of the speaker's face and an enhanced ResNet3D visual front-end (VFE) to extract lip features at different scales. For the multi-encoder, in addition to the mainstream Transformer and Conformer, we also incorporate the recently proposed Branchformer and EBranchformer as visual encoders. In the experiments, we explore the influence of different video data scales and encoders on ALR system performance and fuse the texts transcribed by all ALR systems using recognizer output voting error reduction (ROVER). Finally, our proposed approach placed second in the ICME 2024 ChatCLR Challenge Task 2, with a 21.52% reduction in character error rate (CER) compared to the official baseline on the evaluation set.

- **Summary**: The reconstruction of images observed by subjects from fMRI data collected during visual stimuli has made significant strides in the past decade, thanks to the availability of extensive fMRI datasets and advancements in generative models for image generation. However, the application of visual reconstruction has remained limited. Reconstructing visual imagination presents a greater challenge, with potentially revolutionary applications ranging from aiding individuals with disabilities to verifying witness accounts in court. The primary hurdles in this field are the absence of data collection protocols for visual imagery and the lack of datasets on the subject. Traditionally, fMRI-to-image relies on data collected from subjects exposed to visual stimuli, which poses issues for generating visual imagery based on the difference of brain activity between visual stimulation and visual imagery. For the first time, we have compiled a substantial dataset (around 6h of scans) on visual imagery along with a proposed data collection protocol. We then train a modified version of an fMRI-to-image model and demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing images from two modes of imagination: from memory and from pure imagination. This marks an important step towards creating a technology that allow direct reconstruction of visual imagery.

- **Summary**: Close and continuous interaction with rich contacts is a crucial aspect of human activities (e.g. hugging, dancing) and of interest in many domains like activity recognition, motion prediction, character animation, etc. However, acquiring such skeletal motion is challenging. While direct motion capture is expensive and slow, motion editing/generation is also non-trivial, as complex contact patterns with topological and geometric constraints have to be retained. To this end, we propose a new deep learning method for two-body skeletal interaction motion augmentation, which can generate variations of contact-rich interactions with varying body sizes and proportions while retaining the key geometric/topological relations between two bodies. Our system can learn effectively from a relatively small amount of data and generalize to drastically different skeleton sizes. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show it can generate high-quality motions, has strong generalizability and outperforms traditional optimization-based methods and alternative deep learning solutions.

- **Summary**: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) results in the Lidar point cloud generation task, benefiting from their stable training and iterative refinement during sampling. However, DMs often fail to realistically model Lidar raydrop noise due to their inherent denoising process. To retain the strength of iterative sampling while enhancing the generation of raydrop noise, we introduce LidarGRIT, a generative model that uses auto-regressive transformers to iteratively sample the range images in the latent space rather than image space. Furthermore, LidarGRIT utilises VQ-VAE to separately decode range images and raydrop masks. Our results show that LidarGRIT achieves superior performance compared to SOTA models on KITTI-360 and KITTI odometry datasets. Code available at:https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/LidarGRIT.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods in LiDAR-based archaeological research often leverage visualisation techniques derived from Digital Elevation Models to enhance characteristics of archaeological objects present in the images. This paper investigates the impact of visualisations on deep learning performance through a comprehensive testing framework. The study involves the use of eight semantic segmentation models to evaluate seven diverse visualisations across two study areas, encompassing five archaeological classes. Experimental results reveal that the choice of appropriate visualisations can influence performance by up to 8%. Yet, pinpointing one visualisation that outperforms the others in segmenting all archaeological classes proves challenging. The observed performance variation, reaching up to 25% across different model configurations, underscores the importance of thoughtfully selecting model configurations and LiDAR visualisations for successfully segmenting archaeological objects.

- **Summary**: Accurately distinguishing each object is a fundamental goal of Multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. However, achieving this goal still remains challenging, primarily due to: (i) For crowded scenes with occluded objects, the high overlap of object bounding boxes leads to confusion among closely located objects. Nevertheless, humans naturally perceive the depth of elements in a scene when observing 2D videos. Inspired by this, even though the bounding boxes of objects are close on the camera plane, we can differentiate them in the depth dimension, thereby establishing a 3D perception of the objects. (ii) For videos with rapidly irregular camera motion, abrupt changes in object positions can result in ID switches. However, if the camera pose are known, we can compensate for the errors in linear motion models. In this paper, we propose \textit{DepthMOT}, which achieves: (i) detecting and estimating scene depth map \textit{end-to-end}, (ii) compensating the irregular camera motion by camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DepthMOT in VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT datasets. The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/JackWoo0831/DepthMOT}.

- **Summary**: With recent advances in image and video diffusion models for content creation, a plethora of techniques have been proposed for customizing their generated content. In particular, manipulating the cross-attention layers of Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models has shown great promise in controlling the shape and location of objects in the scene. Transferring image-editing techniques to the video domain, however, is extremely challenging as object motion and temporal consistency are difficult to capture accurately. In this work, we take a first look at the role of cross-attention in Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models for zero-shot video editing. While one-shot models have shown potential in controlling motion and camera movement, we demonstrate zero-shot control over object shape, position and movement in T2V models. We show that despite the limitations of current T2V models, cross-attention guidance can be a promising approach for editing videos.

- **Summary**: Diverse actions give rise to rich audio-visual signals in long videos. Recent works showcase that the two modalities of audio and video exhibit different temporal extents of events and distinct labels. We address the interplay between the two modalities in long videos by explicitly modelling the temporal extents of audio and visual events. We propose the Time Interval Machine (TIM) where a modality-specific time interval poses as a query to a transformer encoder that ingests a long video input. The encoder then attends to the specified interval, as well as the surrounding context in both modalities, in order to recognise the ongoing action.   We test TIM on three long audio-visual video datasets: EPIC-KITCHENS, Perception Test, and AVE, reporting state-of-the-art (SOTA) for recognition. On EPIC-KITCHENS, we beat previous SOTA that utilises LLMs and significantly larger pre-training by 2.9% top-1 action recognition accuracy. Additionally, we show that TIM can be adapted for action detection, using dense multi-scale interval queries, outperforming SOTA on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 for most metrics, and showing strong performance on the Perception Test. Our ablations show the critical role of integrating the two modalities and modelling their time intervals in achieving this performance. Code and models at: https://github.com/JacobChalk/TIM

- **Summary**: For a complete comprehension of multi-person scenes, it is essential to go beyond basic tasks like detection and tracking. Higher-level tasks, such as understanding the interactions and social activities among individuals, are also crucial. Progress towards models that can fully understand scenes involving multiple people is hindered by a lack of sufficient annotated data for such high-level tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Social-MAE, a simple yet effective transformer-based masked autoencoder framework for multi-person human motion data. The framework uses masked modeling to pre-train the encoder to reconstruct masked human joint trajectories, enabling it to learn generalizable and data efficient representations of motion in human crowded scenes. Social-MAE comprises a transformer as the MAE encoder and a lighter-weight transformer as the MAE decoder which operates on multi-person joints' trajectory in the frequency domain. After the reconstruction task, the MAE decoder is replaced with a task-specific decoder and the model is fine-tuned end-to-end for a variety of high-level social tasks. Our proposed model combined with our pre-training approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on various high-level social tasks, including multi-person pose forecasting, social grouping, and social action understanding. These improvements are demonstrated across four popular multi-person datasets encompassing both human 2D and 3D body pose.

- **Summary**: In the era of exceptionally data-hungry models, careful selection of the training data is essential to mitigate the extensive costs of deep learning. Data pruning offers a solution by removing redundant or uninformative samples from the dataset, which yields faster convergence and improved neural scaling laws. However, little is known about its impact on classification bias of the trained models. We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. At the same time, we argue that random data pruning with appropriate class ratios has potential to improve the worst-class performance. We propose a "fairness-aware" approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to further motivate our algorithm and support our findings.

- **Summary**: With recent advancements in visual synthesis, there is a growing risk of encountering images with detrimental effects, such as hate, discrimination, or privacy violations. The research on transforming harmful images into responsible ones remains unexplored. In this paper, we formulate a new task, responsible visual editing, which entails modifying specific concepts within an image to render it more responsible while minimizing changes. However, the concept that needs to be edited is often abstract, making it challenging to locate what needs to be modified and plan how to modify it. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Cognitive Editor (CoEditor) that harnesses the large multimodal model through a two-stage cognitive process: (1) a perceptual cognitive process to focus on what needs to be modified and (2) a behavioral cognitive process to strategize how to modify. To mitigate the negative implications of harmful images on research, we create a transparent and public dataset, AltBear, which expresses harmful information using teddy bears instead of humans. Experiments demonstrate that CoEditor can effectively comprehend abstract concepts within complex scenes and significantly surpass the performance of baseline models for responsible visual editing. We find that the AltBear dataset corresponds well to the harmful content found in real images, offering a consistent experimental evaluation, thereby providing a safer benchmark for future research. Moreover, CoEditor also shows great results in general editing. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/kodenii/Responsible-Visual-Editing.

- **Summary**: With the rise of deep learning, generative models have enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, presenting challenges due to their potential misuse. While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques. To address this generalisation challenge, we propose a novel Deepfake detection approach by adapting rich information encoded inside the Foundation Models with rich information encoded inside, specifically using the image encoder from CLIP which has demonstrated strong zero-shot capability for downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to guidencourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvementsuccess even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especiallytablishing a significant lead of achieving 4.4% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset.

- **Summary**: Diagnosis of hematological malignancies depends on accurate identification of white blood cells in peripheral blood smears. Deep learning techniques are emerging as a viable solution to scale and optimize this process by automatic identification of cells in laboratories. However, these techniques face several challenges such as limited generalizability, sensitivity to domain shifts and lack of explainability. Here, we are introducing a novel approach based on neural cellular automata (NCA) for white blood cell classification. We test our approach on three datasets of white blood cell images and show that we achieve competitive performance compared to conventional methods. Our NCA-based method is significantly smaller in terms of parameters and exhibits robustness to domain shifts. Furthermore, the architecture is inherently explainable, providing insights into the decision process for each classification, helping experts understand and validate model predictions. Results demonstrate that NCA not only can be used for image classification, but also address key challenges of conventional methods, indicating a high potential for applicability in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of image generation, leading to the proliferation of high-quality models and diverse downstream applications. However, despite these significant advancements, the current competitive solutions still suffer from several limitations, including inferior visual quality, a lack of aesthetic appeal, and inefficient inference, without a comprehensive solution in sight. To address these challenges, we present UniFL, a unified framework that leverages feedback learning to enhance diffusion models comprehensively. UniFL stands out as a universal, effective, and generalizable solution applicable to various diffusion models, such as SD1.5 and SDXL. Notably, UniFL incorporates three key components: perceptual feedback learning, which enhances visual quality; decoupled feedback learning, which improves aesthetic appeal; and adversarial feedback learning, which optimizes inference speed. In-depth experiments and extensive user studies validate the superior performance of our proposed method in enhancing both the quality of generated models and their acceleration. For instance, UniFL surpasses ImageReward by 17% user preference in terms of generation quality and outperforms LCM and SDXL Turbo by 57% and 20% in 4-step inference. Moreover, we have verified the efficacy of our approach in downstream tasks, including Lora, ControlNet, and AnimateDiff.

- **Summary**: In the field of visual affordance learning, previous methods mainly used abundant images or videos that delineate human behavior patterns to identify action possibility regions for object manipulation, with a variety of applications in robotic tasks. However, they encounter a main challenge of action ambiguity, illustrated by the vagueness like whether to beat or carry a drum, and the complexities involved in processing intricate scenes. Moreover, it is important for human intervention to rectify robot errors in time. To address these issues, we introduce Self-Explainable Affordance learning (SEA) with embodied caption. This innovation enables robots to articulate their intentions and bridge the gap between explainable vision-language caption and visual affordance learning. Due to a lack of appropriate dataset, we unveil a pioneering dataset and metrics tailored for this task, which integrates images, heatmaps, and embodied captions. Furthermore, we propose a novel model to effectively combine affordance grounding with self-explanation in a simple but efficient manner. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness.

- **Summary**: Face meshes in consistent topology serve as the foundation for many face-related applications, such as 3DMM constrained face reconstruction and expression retargeting. Traditional methods commonly acquire topology uniformed face meshes by two separate steps: multi-view stereo (MVS) to reconstruct shapes followed by non-rigid registration to align topology, but struggles with handling noise and non-lambertian surfaces. Recently neural volume rendering techniques have been rapidly evolved and shown great advantages in 3D reconstruction or novel view synthesis. Our goal is to leverage the superiority of neural volume rendering into multi-view reconstruction of face mesh with consistent topology. We propose a mesh volume rendering method that enables directly optimizing mesh geometry while preserving topology, and learning implicit features to model complex facial appearance from multi-view images. The key innovation lies in spreading sparse mesh features into the surrounding space to simulate radiance field required for volume rendering, which facilitates backpropagation of gradients from images to mesh geometry and implicit appearance features. Our proposed feature spreading module exhibits deformation invariance, enabling photorealistic rendering seamlessly after mesh editing. We conduct experiments on multi-view face image dataset to evaluate the reconstruction and implement an application for photorealistic rendering of animated face mesh.

- **Summary**: Nowadays, the family of Stable Diffusion (SD) models has gained prominence for its high quality outputs and scalability. This has also raised security concerns on social media, as malicious users can create and disseminate harmful content. Existing approaches involve training components or entire SDs to embed a watermark in generated images for traceability and responsibility attribution. However, in the era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the rapid iteration of SDs renders retraining with watermark models costly. To address this, we propose a training-free plug-and-play watermark framework for SDs. Without modifying any components of SDs, we embed diverse watermarks in the latent space, adapting to the denoising process. Our experimental findings reveal that our method effectively harmonizes image quality and watermark invisibility. Furthermore, it performs robustly under various attacks. We also have validated that our method is generalized to multiple versions of SDs, even without retraining the watermark model.

- **Summary**: While excellent in transfer learning, Vision-Language models (VLMs) come with high computational costs due to their large number of parameters. To address this issue, removing parameters via model pruning is a viable solution. However, existing techniques for VLMs are task-specific, and thus require pruning the network from scratch for each new task of interest. In this work, we explore a new direction: Task-Agnostic Vision-Language Pruning (TA-VLP). Given a pretrained VLM, the goal is to find a unique pruned counterpart transferable to multiple unknown downstream tasks. In this challenging setting, the transferable representations already encoded in the pretrained model are a key aspect to preserve. Thus, we propose Multimodal Flow Pruning (MULTIFLOW), a first, gradient-free, pruning framework for TA-VLP where: (i) the importance of a parameter is expressed in terms of its magnitude and its information flow, by incorporating the saliency of the neurons it connects; and (ii) pruning is driven by the emergent (multimodal) distribution of the VLM parameters after pretraining. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art pruning algorithms in the context of TA-VLP, experimenting with two VLMs, three vision-language tasks, and three pruning ratios. Our experimental results show that MULTIFLOW outperforms recent sophisticated, combinatorial competitors in the vast majority of the cases, paving the way towards addressing TA-VLP.

- **Summary**: 3D object pose estimation is a challenging task. Previous works always require thousands of object images with annotated poses for learning the 3D pose correspondence, which is laborious and time-consuming for labeling. In this paper, we propose to learn a category-level 3D object pose estimator without pose annotations. Instead of using manually annotated images, we leverage diffusion models (e.g., Zero-1-to-3) to generate a set of images under controlled pose differences and propose to learn our object pose estimator with those images. Directly using the original diffusion model leads to images with noisy poses and artifacts. To tackle this issue, firstly, we exploit an image encoder, which is learned from a specially designed contrastive pose learning, to filter the unreasonable details and extract image feature maps. Additionally, we propose a novel learning strategy that allows the model to learn object poses from those generated image sets without knowing the alignment of their canonical poses. Experimental results show that our method has the capability of category-level object pose estimation from a single shot setting (as pose definition), while significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on the few-shot category-level object pose estimation benchmarks.

- **Summary**: We introduce 3D-COCO, an extension of the original MS-COCO dataset providing 3D models and 2D-3D alignment annotations. 3D-COCO was designed to achieve computer vision tasks such as 3D reconstruction or image detection configurable with textual, 2D image, and 3D CAD model queries. We complete the existing MS-COCO dataset with 28K 3D models collected on ShapeNet and Objaverse. By using an IoU-based method, we match each MS-COCO annotation with the best 3D models to provide a 2D-3D alignment. The open-source nature of 3D-COCO is a premiere that should pave the way for new research on 3D-related topics.

- **Summary**: Self-attention mechanism is the key of the Transformer but often criticized for its computation demands. Previous token pruning works motivate their methods from the view of computation redundancy but still need to load the full network and require same memory costs. This paper introduces a novel strategy that simplifies vision transformers and reduces computational load through the selective removal of non-essential attention layers, guided by entropy considerations. We identify that regarding the attention layer in bottom blocks, their subsequent MLP layers, i.e. two feed-forward layers, can elicit the same entropy quantity. Meanwhile, the accompanied MLPs are under-exploited since they exhibit smaller feature entropy compared to those MLPs in the top blocks. Therefore, we propose to integrate the uninformative attention layers into their subsequent counterparts by degenerating them into identical mapping, yielding only MLP in certain transformer blocks. Experimental results on ImageNet-1k show that the proposed method can remove 40% attention layer of DeiT-B, improving throughput and memory bound without performance compromise.

- **Summary**: We propose a framework for automatic colorization that allows for iterative editing and modifications. The core of our framework lies in an imagination module: by understanding the content within a grayscale image, we utilize a pre-trained image generation model to generate multiple images that contain the same content. These images serve as references for coloring, mimicking the process of human experts. As the synthesized images can be imperfect or different from the original grayscale image, we propose a Reference Refinement Module to select the optimal reference composition. Unlike most previous end-to-end automatic colorization algorithms, our framework allows for iterative and localized modifications of the colorization results because we explicitly model the coloring samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing automatic colorization algorithms in editability and flexibility.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of diffusion models (DMs) and the substantially increased computational requirements, quantization emerges as a practical solution to obtain compact and efficient low-bit DMs. However, the highly discrete representation leads to severe accuracy degradation, hindering the quantization of diffusion models to ultra-low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose BinaryDM, a novel accurate quantization-aware training approach to push the weights of diffusion models towards the limit of 1-bit. Firstly, we present a Learnable Multi-basis Binarizer (LMB) to recover the representations generated by the binarized DM, which improves the information in details of representations crucial to the DM. Secondly, a Low-rank Representation Mimicking (LRM) is applied to enhance the binarization-aware optimization of the DM, alleviating the optimization direction ambiguity caused by fine-grained alignment. Moreover, a progressive initialization strategy is applied to training DMs to avoid convergence difficulties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinaryDM achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gains compared to SOTA quantization methods of DMs under ultra-low bit-widths. As the first binarization method for diffusion models, BinaryDM achieves impressive 16.0 times FLOPs and 27.1 times storage savings with 1-bit weight and 4-bit activation, showcasing its substantial advantages and potential for deploying DMs on resource-limited scenarios.

- **Summary**: In the rapidly progressing field of generative models, the development of efficient and high-fidelity text-to-image diffusion systems represents a significant frontier. This study introduces YaART, a novel production-grade text-to-image cascaded diffusion model aligned to human preferences using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). During the development of YaART, we especially focus on the choices of the model and training dataset sizes, the aspects that were not systematically investigated for text-to-image cascaded diffusion models before. In particular, we comprehensively analyze how these choices affect both the efficiency of the training process and the quality of the generated images, which are highly important in practice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained on smaller datasets of higher-quality images can successfully compete with those trained on larger datasets, establishing a more efficient scenario of diffusion models training. From the quality perspective, YaART is consistently preferred by users over many existing state-of-the-art models.

- **Summary**: A serious issue that harms the performance of zero-shot visual recognition is named objective misalignment, i.e., the learning objective prioritizes improving the recognition accuracy of seen classes rather than unseen classes, while the latter is the true target to pursue. This issue becomes more significant in zero-shot image segmentation because the stronger (i.e., pixel-level) supervision brings a larger gap between seen and unseen classes. To mitigate it, we propose a novel architecture named AlignZeg, which embodies a comprehensive improvement of the segmentation pipeline, including proposal extraction, classification, and correction, to better fit the goal of zero-shot segmentation. (1) Mutually-Refined Proposal Extraction. AlignZeg harnesses a mutual interaction between mask queries and visual features, facilitating detailed class-agnostic mask proposal extraction. (2) Generalization-Enhanced Proposal Classification. AlignZeg introduces synthetic data and incorporates multiple background prototypes to allocate a more generalizable feature space. (3) Predictive Bias Correction. During the inference stage, AlignZeg uses a class indicator to find potential unseen class proposals followed by a prediction postprocess to correct the prediction bias. Experiments demonstrate that AlignZeg markedly enhances zero-shot semantic segmentation, as shown by an average 3.8% increase in hIoU, primarily attributed to a 7.1% improvement in identifying unseen classes, and we further validate that the improvement comes from alleviating the objective misalignment issue.

- **Summary**: Real-world documents may suffer various forms of degradation, often resulting in lower accuracy in optical character recognition (OCR) systems. Therefore, a crucial preprocessing step is essential to eliminate noise while preserving text and key features of documents. In this paper, we propose NAF-DPM, a novel generative framework based on a diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) designed to restore the original quality of degraded documents. While DPMs are recognized for their high-quality generated images, they are also known for their large inference time. To mitigate this problem we provide the DPM with an efficient nonlinear activation-free (NAF) network and we employ as a sampler a fast solver of ordinary differential equations, which can converge in a few iterations. To better preserve text characters, we introduce an additional differentiable module based on convolutional recurrent neural networks, simulating the behavior of an OCR system during training. Experiments conducted on various datasets showcase the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of pixel-level and perceptual similarity metrics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a notable character error reduction made by OCR systems when transcribing real-world document images enhanced by our framework.

- **Summary**: The reasoning segmentation task, which demands a nuanced comprehension of intricate queries to accurately pinpoint object regions, is attracting increasing attention. However, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) often find it difficult to accurately localize the objects described in complex reasoning contexts. We believe that the act of reasoning segmentation should mirror the cognitive stages of human visual search, where each step is a progressive refinement of thought toward the final object. Thus we introduce the Chains of Reasoning and Segmenting (CoReS) and find this top-down visual hierarchy indeed enhances the visual search process. Specifically, we propose a dual-chain structure that generates multi-modal, chain-like outputs to aid the segmentation process. Furthermore, to steer the MLLM's outputs into this intended hierarchy, we incorporate in-context inputs as guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our CoReS, which surpasses the state-of-the-art method by 7.1\% on the ReasonSeg dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/baoxiaoyi/CoReS.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we present MoMA: an open-vocabulary, training-free personalized image model that boasts flexible zero-shot capabilities. As foundational text-to-image models rapidly evolve, the demand for robust image-to-image translation grows. Addressing this need, MoMA specializes in subject-driven personalized image generation. Utilizing an open-source, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), we train MoMA to serve a dual role as both a feature extractor and a generator. This approach effectively synergizes reference image and text prompt information to produce valuable image features, facilitating an image diffusion model. To better leverage the generated features, we further introduce a novel self-attention shortcut method that efficiently transfers image features to an image diffusion model, improving the resemblance of the target object in generated images. Remarkably, as a tuning-free plug-and-play module, our model requires only a single reference image and outperforms existing methods in generating images with high detail fidelity, enhanced identity-preservation and prompt faithfulness. Our work is open-source, thereby providing universal access to these advancements.

- **Summary**: Normalizing flows have proven their efficacy for density estimation in Euclidean space, but their application to rotational representations, crucial in various domains such as robotics or human pose modeling, remains underexplored. Probabilistic models of the human pose can benefit from approaches that rigorously consider the rotational nature of human joints. For this purpose, we introduce HuProSO3, a normalizing flow model that operates on a high-dimensional product space of SO(3) manifolds, modeling the joint distribution for human joints with three degrees of freedom. HuProSO3's advantage over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through its superior modeling accuracy in three different applications and its capability to evaluate the exact likelihood. This work not only addresses the technical challenge of learning densities on SO(3) manifolds, but it also has broader implications for domains where the probabilistic regression of correlated 3D rotations is of importance.

- **Summary**: While recent advances in 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have aided the development of near-frontal view human face synthesis, the challenge of comprehensively synthesizing a full 3D head viewable from all angles still persists. Although PanoHead proves the possibilities of using a large-scale dataset with images of both frontal and back views for full-head synthesis, it often causes artifacts for back views. Based on our in-depth analysis, we found the reasons are mainly twofold. First, from network architecture perspective, we found each plane in the utilized tri-plane/tri-grid representation space tends to confuse the features from both sides, causing "mirroring" artifacts (e.g., the glasses appear in the back). Second, from data supervision aspect, we found that existing discriminator training in 3D GANs mainly focuses on the quality of the rendered image itself, and does not care much about its plausibility with the perspective from which it was rendered. This makes it possible to generate "face" in non-frontal views, due to its easiness to fool the discriminator. In response, we propose SphereHead, a novel tri-plane representation in the spherical coordinate system that fits the human head's geometric characteristics and efficiently mitigates many of the generated artifacts. We further introduce a view-image consistency loss for the discriminator to emphasize the correspondence of the camera parameters and the images. The combination of these efforts results in visually superior outcomes with significantly fewer artifacts. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://lhyfst.github.io/spherehead.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) has been studied with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect novel objects beyond the pre-trained categories. Previous approaches improve the generalization ability to expand the knowledge of the detector, using 'positive' pseudo-labels with additional 'class' names, e.g., sock, iPod, and alligator. To extend the previous methods in two aspects, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Losses and visual Features (RALF). Our method retrieves related 'negative' classes and augments loss functions. Also, visual features are augmented with 'verbalized concepts' of classes, e.g., worn on the feet, handheld music player, and sharp teeth. Specifically, RALF consists of two modules: Retrieval Augmented Losses (RAL) and Retrieval-Augmented visual Features (RAF). RAL constitutes two losses reflecting the semantic similarity with negative vocabularies. In addition, RAF augments visual features with the verbalized concepts from a large language model (LLM). Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RALF on COCO and LVIS benchmark datasets. We achieve improvement up to 3.4 box AP$_{50}^{\text{N}}$ on novel categories of the COCO dataset and 3.6 mask AP$_{\text{r}}$ gains on the LVIS dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/RALF .

- **Summary**: Satellite imagery is crucial for tasks like environmental monitoring and urban planning. Typically, it relies on semantic segmentation or Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification to categorize each pixel. Despite the advancements brought about by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their performance in segmentation tasks is hindered by challenges such as limited availability of labeled data, class imbalance and the inherent variability and complexity of satellite images. In order to mitigate those issues, our study explores the effectiveness of a Cut-and-Paste augmentation technique for semantic segmentation in satellite images. We adapt this augmentation, which usually requires labeled instances, to the case of semantic segmentation. By leveraging the connected components in the semantic segmentation labels, we extract instances that are then randomly pasted during training. Using the DynamicEarthNet dataset and a U-Net model for evaluation, we found that this augmentation significantly enhances the mIoU score on the test set from 37.9 to 44.1. This finding highlights the potential of the Cut-and-Paste augmentation to improve the generalization capabilities of semantic segmentation models in satellite imagery.

- **Summary**: Collecting accurate camera poses of training images has been shown to well serve the learning of 3D-aware generative adversarial networks (GANs) yet can be quite expensive in practice. This work targets learning 3D-aware GANs from unposed images, for which we propose to perform on-the-fly pose estimation of training images with a learned template feature field (TeFF). Concretely, in addition to a generative radiance field as in previous approaches, we ask the generator to also learn a field from 2D semantic features while sharing the density from the radiance field. Such a framework allows us to acquire a canonical 3D feature template leveraging the dataset mean discovered by the generative model, and further efficiently estimate the pose parameters on real data. Experimental results on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art alternatives from both the qualitative and the quantitative perspectives.

- **Summary**: Effective editing of personal content holds a pivotal role in enabling individuals to express their creativity, weaving captivating narratives within their visual stories, and elevate the overall quality and impact of their visual content. Therefore, in this work, we introduce SwapAnything, a novel framework that can swap any objects in an image with personalized concepts given by the reference, while keeping the context unchanged. Compared with existing methods for personalized subject swapping, SwapAnything has three unique advantages: (1) precise control of arbitrary objects and parts rather than the main subject, (2) more faithful preservation of context pixels, (3) better adaptation of the personalized concept to the image. First, we propose targeted variable swapping to apply region control over latent feature maps and swap masked variables for faithful context preservation and initial semantic concept swapping. Then, we introduce appearance adaptation, to seamlessly adapt the semantic concept into the original image in terms of target location, shape, style, and content during the image generation process. Extensive results on both human and automatic evaluation demonstrate significant improvements of our approach over baseline methods on personalized swapping. Furthermore, SwapAnything shows its precise and faithful swapping abilities across single object, multiple objects, partial object, and cross-domain swapping tasks. SwapAnything also achieves great performance on text-based swapping and tasks beyond swapping such as object insertion.

- **Summary**: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate "any resolution" on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio (i.e., horizontal division for portrait screens and vertical division for landscape screens). Both sub-images are encoded separately before being sent to LLMs. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model's reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, perception/interaction conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.

- **Summary**: With the success of large language models (LLMs), integrating the vision model into LLMs to build vision-language foundation models has gained much more interest recently. However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.

- **Summary**: Visual Prompting is a technique for teaching models to perform a visual task via in-context examples, without any additional training. In this work, we analyze the activations of MAE-VQGAN, a recent Visual Prompting model, and find task vectors, activations that encode task-specific information. Equipped with this insight, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify the task vectors and use them to guide the network towards performing different tasks without providing any input-output examples. To find task vectors, we compute the average intermediate activations per task and use the REINFORCE algorithm to search for the subset of task vectors. The resulting task vectors guide the model towards performing a task better than the original model without the need for input-output examples.

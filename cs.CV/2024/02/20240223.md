- **Summary**: The identification and characterization of various rock types is one of the fundamental activities for geology and related areas such as mining, petroleum, environment, industry and construction. Traditionally, a human specialist is responsible for analyzing and explaining details about the type, composition, texture, shape and other properties using rock samples collected in-situ or prepared in a laboratory. The results become subjective based on experience, in addition to consuming a large investment of time and effort. The present proposal uses artificial intelligence techniques combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate a textual and verbal description from a thin section image of rock. We build a dataset of images and their respective textual descriptions for the training of a model that associates the relevant features of the image extracted by EfficientNetB7 with the textual description generated by a Transformer network, reaching an accuracy value of 0.892 and a BLEU value of 0.71. This model can be a useful resource for research, professional and academic work, so it has been deployed through a Web application for public use.

- **Summary**: Deep learning methods have led to significant improvements in the performance on the facial landmark detection (FLD) task. However, detecting landmarks in challenging settings, such as head pose changes, exaggerated expressions, or uneven illumination, continue to remain a challenge due to high variability and insufficient samples. This inadequacy can be attributed to the model's inability to effectively acquire appropriate facial structure information from the input images. To address this, we propose a novel image augmentation technique specifically designed for the FLD task to enhance the model's understanding of facial structures. To effectively utilize the newly proposed augmentation technique, we employ a Siamese architecture-based training mechanism with a Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA)-based loss to achieve collective learning of high-level feature representations from two different views of the input images. Furthermore, we employ a Transformer + CNN-based network with a custom hourglass module as the robust backbone for the Siamese framework. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms multiple state-of-the-art approaches across various benchmark datasets.

- **Summary**: Transformer-based models have significantly improved performance across a range of multimodal understanding tasks, such as visual question answering and action recognition. However, multimodal Transformers significantly suffer from a quadratic complexity of the multi-head attention with the input sequence length, especially as the number of modalities increases. To address this, we introduce Low-Cost Multimodal Transformer (LoCoMT), a novel multimodal attention mechanism that aims to reduce computational cost during training and inference with minimal performance loss. Specifically, by assigning different multimodal attention patterns to each attention head, LoCoMT can flexibly control multimodal signals and theoretically ensures a reduced computational cost compared to existing multimodal Transformer variants. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets, namely Audioset and MedVidCL demonstrate that LoCoMT not only reduces GFLOPs but also matches or even outperforms established models.

- **Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance in powering text-based AI agents, endowing them with decision-making and reasoning abilities akin to humans. Concurrently, there is an emerging research trend focused on extending these LLM-powered AI agents into the multimodal domain. This extension enables AI agents to interpret and respond to diverse multimodal user queries, thereby handling more intricate and nuanced tasks. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of LLM-driven multimodal agents, which we refer to as large multimodal agents ( LMAs for short). First, we introduce the essential components involved in developing LMAs and categorize the current body of research into four distinct types. Subsequently, we review the collaborative frameworks integrating multiple LMAs , enhancing collective efficacy. One of the critical challenges in this field is the diverse evaluation methods used across existing studies, hindering effective comparison among different LMAs . Therefore, we compile these evaluation methodologies and establish a comprehensive framework to bridge the gaps. This framework aims to standardize evaluations, facilitating more meaningful comparisons. Concluding our review, we highlight the extensive applications of LMAs and propose possible future research directions. Our discussion aims to provide valuable insights and guidelines for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

- **Summary**: Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated considerable success across various vision-language tasks, such as text-to-image retrieval, where the model is required to effectively process natural language input to produce an accurate visual output. However, current models still face limitations in dealing with linguistic variations in input queries, such as paraphrases, making it challenging to handle a broad range of user queries in real-world applications. In this study, we introduce a straightforward fine-tuning approach to enhance the representations of CLIP models for paraphrases. Our approach involves a two-step paraphrase generation process, where we automatically create two categories of paraphrases from web-scale image captions by leveraging large language models. Subsequently, we fine-tune the CLIP text encoder using these generated paraphrases while freezing the image encoder. Our resulting model, which we call ParaCLIP, exhibits significant improvements over baseline CLIP models across various tasks, including paraphrased retrieval (with rank similarity scores improved by up to 2.0% and 5.6%), Visual Genome Relation and Attribution, as well as seven semantic textual similarity tasks.



### Modified CycleGAN for the synthesization of samples for wheat head segmentation

- **Summary**: Deep learning models have been used for a variety of image processing tasks. However, most of these models are developed through supervised learning approaches, which rely heavily on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Developing such datasets is tedious and expensive. In the absence of an annotated dataset, synthetic data can be used for model development; however, due to the substantial differences between simulated and real data, a phenomenon referred to as domain gap, the resulting models often underperform when applied to real data. In this research, we aim to address this challenge by first computationally simulating a large-scale annotated dataset and then using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to fill the gap between simulated and real images. This approach results in a synthetic dataset that can be effectively utilized to train a deep-learning model. Using this approach, we developed a realistic annotated synthetic dataset for wheat head segmentation. This dataset was then used to develop a deep-learning model for semantic segmentation. The resulting model achieved a Dice score of 83.4\% on an internal dataset and Dice scores of 79.6% and 83.6% on two external Global Wheat Head Detection datasets. While we proposed this approach in the context of wheat head segmentation, it can be generalized to other crop types or, more broadly, to images with dense, repeated patterns such as those found in cellular imagery.

- **Summary**: Developing an accurate and fast anomaly detection model is an important task in real-time computer vision applications. There has been much research to develop a single model that detects either structural or logical anomalies, which are inherently distinct. The majority of the existing approaches implicitly assume that the anomaly can be represented by identifying the anomalous location. However, we argue that logical anomalies, such as the wrong number of objects, can not be well-represented by the spatial feature maps and require an alternative approach. In addition, we focused on the possibility of detecting logical anomalies by using an out-of-distribution detection approach on the feature space, which aggregates the spatial information of the feature map. As a demonstration, we propose a method that incorporates a simple out-of-distribution detection method on the feature space against state-of-the-art reconstruction-based approaches. Despite the simplicity of our proposal, our method PUAD (Picturable and Unpicturable Anomaly Detection) achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset.

- **Summary**: Blurring mean shift (BMS) algorithm, a variant of the mean shift algorithm, is a kernel-based iterative method for data clustering, where data points are clustered according to their convergent points via iterative blurring. In this paper, we analyze convergence properties of the BMS algorithm by leveraging its interpretation as an optimization procedure, which is known but has been underutilized in existing convergence studies. Whereas existing results on convergence properties applicable to multi-dimensional data only cover the case where all the blurred data point sequences converge to a single point, this study provides a convergence guarantee even when those sequences can converge to multiple points, yielding multiple clusters. This study also shows that the convergence of the BMS algorithm is fast by further leveraging geometrical characterization of the convergent points.

- **Summary**: In visual speech processing, context modeling capability is one of the most important requirements due to the ambiguous nature of lip movements. For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual Speech Processing incorporated with LLMs (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of LLMs. Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual speech recognition and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of a LLM by employing a self-supervised visual speech model. Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptors (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner. In the translation dataset, the MuAViC benchmark, we demonstrate that VSP-LLM can more effectively recognize and translate lip movements with just 15 hours of labeled data, compared to the recent translation model trained with 433 hours of labeld data.

- **Summary**: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have established themselves as a powerful method for unsupervised pre-training for computer vision tasks. While vanilla MAEs put equal emphasis on reconstructing the individual parts of the image, we propose to inform the reconstruction process through an attention-guided loss function. By leveraging advances in unsupervised object discovery, we obtain an attention map of the scene which we employ in the loss function to put increased emphasis on reconstructing relevant objects, thus effectively incentivizing the model to learn more object-focused representations without compromising the established masking strategy. Our evaluations show that our pre-trained models learn better latent representations than the vanilla MAE, demonstrated by improved linear probing and k-NN classification results on several benchmarks while at the same time making ViTs more robust against varying backgrounds.

- **Summary**: Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OUDA) for person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is the task of continuously adapting a model trained on a well-annotated source domain dataset to a target domain observed as a data stream. In OUDA, person Re-ID models face two main challenges: catastrophic forgetting and domain shift. In this work, we propose a new Source-guided Similarity Preservation (S2P) framework to alleviate these two problems. Our framework is based on the extraction of a support set composed of source images that maximizes the similarity with the target data. This support set is used to identify feature similarities that must be preserved during the learning process. S2P can incorporate multiple existing UDA methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments show that S2P outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-to-real and synthetic-to-real challenging OUDA benchmarks.

- **Summary**: Accurate segmentation of multiple organs in Computed Tomography (CT) images plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis systems. Various supervised-learning approaches have been proposed recently. However, these methods heavily depend on a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which is expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we present a label-efficient learning approach using a pre-trained diffusion model for multi-organ segmentation tasks in CT images. First, a denoising diffusion model was trained using unlabeled CT data, generating additional two-dimensional (2D) CT images. Then the pre-trained denoising diffusion network was transferred to the downstream multi-organ segmentation task, effectively creating a semi-supervised learning model that requires only a small amount of labeled data. Furthermore, linear classification and fine-tuning decoder strategies were employed to enhance the network's segmentation performance. Our generative model at 256x256 resolution achieves impressive performance in terms of Fr\'echet inception distance, spatial Fr\'echet inception distance, and F1-score, with values of 11.32, 46.93, and 73.1\%, respectively. These results affirm the diffusion model's ability to generate diverse and realistic 2D CT images. Additionally, our method achieves competitive multi-organ segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on the FLARE 2022 dataset, particularly in limited labeled data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only 1\% and 10\% labeled data, our method achieves Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 71.56\% and 78.51\% after fine-tuning, respectively. The method achieves a DSC score of 51.81\% using just four labeled CT scans. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in overcoming the limitations of supervised learning heavily reliant on large-scale labeled data.

- **Summary**: Extremely large image generators offer significant transformative potential across diverse sectors. It allows users to design specific prompts to generate realistic images through some black-box APIs. However, some studies reveal that image generators are notably susceptible to attacks and generate Not Suitable For Work (NSFW) contents by manually designed toxin texts, especially imperceptible to human observers. We urgently need a multitude of universal and transferable prompts to improve the safety of image generators, especially black-box-released APIs. Nevertheless, they are constrained by labor-intensive design processes and heavily reliant on the quality of the given instructions. To achieve this, we introduce a black-box stealthy prompt attack (BSPA) that adopts a retriever to simulate attacks from API users. It can effectively harness filter scores to tune the retrieval space of sensitive words for matching the input prompts, thereby crafting stealthy prompts tailored for image generators. Significantly, this approach is model-agnostic and requires no internal access to the model's features, ensuring its applicability to a wide range of image generators. Building on BSPA, we have constructed an automated prompt tool and a comprehensive prompt attack dataset (NSFWeval). Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSPA effectively explores the security vulnerabilities in a variety of state-of-the-art available black-box models, including Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2/3. Furthermore, we develop a resilient text filter and offer targeted recommendations to ensure the security of image generators against prompt attacks in the future.

- **Summary**: Transfer learning methods endeavor to leverage relevant knowledge from existing source pre-trained models or datasets to solve downstream target tasks. With the increase in the scale and quantity of available pre-trained models nowadays, it becomes critical to assess in advance whether they are suitable for a specific target task. Model transferability estimation is an emerging and growing area of interest, aiming to propose a metric to quantify this suitability without training them individually, which is computationally prohibitive. Despite extensive recent advances already devoted to this area, they have custom terminological definitions and experimental settings. In this survey, we present the first review of existing advances in this area and categorize them into two separate realms: source-free model transferability estimation and source-dependent model transferability estimation. Each category is systematically defined, accompanied by a comprehensive taxonomy. Besides, we address challenges and outline future research directions, intending to provide a comprehensive guide to aid researchers and practitioners.

- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenging task of estimating font impressions from real font images. We use a font dataset with annotation about font impressions and a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for this task. However, impressions attached to individual fonts are often missing and noisy because of the subjective characteristic of font impression annotation. To realize stable impression estimation even with such a dataset, we propose an exemplar-based impression estimation approach, which relies on a strategy of ensembling impressions of exemplar fonts that are similar to the input image. In addition, we train CNN with synthetic font images that mimic scanned word images so that CNN estimates impressions of font images in the wild. We evaluate the basic performance of the proposed estimation method quantitatively and qualitatively. Then, we conduct a correlation analysis between book genres and font impressions on real book cover images; it is important to note that this analysis is only possible with our impression estimation method. The analysis reveals various trends in the correlation between them - this fact supports a hypothesis that book cover designers carefully choose a font for a book cover considering the impression given by the font.

- **Summary**: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to align the labelled source distribution with the unlabelled target distribution to obtain domain-invariant predictive models. Since cross-modality medical data exhibit significant intra and inter-domain shifts and most are unlabelled, UDA is more important while challenging in medical image analysis. This paper proposes a simple yet potent contrastive learning framework for UDA to narrow the inter-domain gap between labelled source and unlabelled target distribution. Our method is validated on cerebral vessel datasets. Experimental results show that our approach can learn latent features from labelled 3DRA modality data and improve vessel segmentation performance in unlabelled MRA modality data.

- **Summary**: The automated segmentation of cerebral aneurysms is pivotal for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Confronted with significant domain shifts and class imbalance in 3D Rotational Angiography (3DRA) data from various medical institutions, the task becomes challenging. These shifts include differences in image appearance, intensity distribution, resolution, and aneurysm size, all of which complicate the segmentation process. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain generalization strategy that employs gradient surgery exponential moving average (GS-EMA) optimization technique coupled with boundary-aware contrastive learning (BACL). Our approach is distinct in its ability to adapt to new, unseen domains by learning domain-invariant features, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of aneurysm segmentation across diverse clinical datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach can extract more domain-invariant features, minimizing over-segmentation and capturing more complete aneurysm structures.

- **Summary**: In autonomous driving, cooperative perception makes use of multi-view cameras from both vehicles and infrastructure, providing a global vantage point with rich semantic context of road conditions beyond a single vehicle viewpoint. Currently, two major challenges persist in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection: $1)$ inherent pose errors when fusing multi-view images, caused by time asynchrony across cameras; $2)$ information loss in transmission process resulted from limited communication bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose a novel camera-based 3D detection framework for VIC3D task, Enhanced Multi-scale Image Feature Fusion (EMIFF). To fully exploit holistic perspectives from both vehicles and infrastructure, we propose Multi-scale Cross Attention (MCA) and Camera-aware Channel Masking (CCM) modules to enhance infrastructure and vehicle features at scale, spatial, and channel levels to correct the pose error introduced by camera asynchrony. We also introduce a Feature Compression (FC) module with channel and spatial compression blocks for transmission efficiency. Experiments show that EMIFF achieves SOTA on DAIR-V2X-C datasets, significantly outperforming previous early-fusion and late-fusion methods with comparable transmission costs.

- **Summary**: Miniaturized autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining popularity due to their small size, enabling new tasks such as indoor navigation or people monitoring. Nonetheless, their size and simple electronics pose severe challenges in implementing advanced onboard intelligence. This work proposes a new automatic optimization pipeline for visual pose estimation tasks using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The pipeline leverages two different Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms to pursue a vast complexity-driven exploration in the DNNs' architectural space. The obtained networks are then deployed on an off-the-shelf nano-drone equipped with a parallel ultra-low power System-on-Chip leveraging a set of novel software kernels for the efficient fused execution of critical DNN layer sequences. Our results improve the state-of-the-art reducing inference latency by up to 3.22x at iso-error.

- **Summary**: Text-to-image retrieval plays a crucial role across various applications, including digital libraries, e-commerce platforms, and multimedia databases, by enabling the search for images using text queries. Despite the advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which offer leading-edge performance, their applicability in large-scale, varied, and ambiguous retrieval scenarios is constrained by significant computational demands and the generation of injective embeddings. This paper introduces the Text2Pic Swift framework, tailored for efficient and robust retrieval of images corresponding to extensive textual descriptions in sizable datasets. The framework employs a two-tier approach: the initial Entity-based Ranking (ER) stage addresses the ambiguity inherent in lengthy text queries through a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets strategy, effectively narrowing down potential candidates for subsequent analysis. Following this, the Summary-based Re-ranking (SR) stage further refines these selections based on concise query summaries. Additionally, we present a novel Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of ambiguous queries and to facilitate both stages of the retrieval process, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency via vector-based similarity assessments. Our evaluation, conducted on the AToMiC dataset, demonstrates that Text2Pic Swift outperforms current MLLMs by achieving up to an 11.06% increase in Recall@1000, alongside reductions in training and retrieval durations by 68.75% and 99.79%, respectively.

- **Summary**: This paper focuses on semi-supervised crowd counting, where only a small portion of the training data are labeled. We formulate the pixel-wise density value to regress as a probability distribution, instead of a single deterministic value. On this basis, we propose a semi-supervised crowd-counting model. Firstly, we design a pixel-wise distribution matching loss to measure the differences in the pixel-wise density distributions between the prediction and the ground truth; Secondly, we enhance the transformer decoder by using density tokens to specialize the forwards of decoders w.r.t. different density intervals; Thirdly, we design the interleaving consistency self-supervised learning mechanism to learn from unlabeled data efficiently. Extensive experiments on four datasets are performed to show that our method clearly outperforms the competitors by a large margin under various labeled ratio settings. Code will be released at https://github.com/LoraLinH/Semi-supervised-Counting-via-Pixel-by-pixel-Density-Distribution-Modelling.

- **Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to object hallucinations, an issue in which their generated text contains non-existent objects, greatly limiting their reliability and practicality. Current approaches often rely on the model's token likelihoods or other internal information, instruction tuning on additional datasets, or incorporating complex external tools. We first perform empirical analysis on sentence-level LVLM hallucination, finding that CLIP similarity to the image acts as a stronger and more robust indicator of hallucination compared to token likelihoods. Motivated by this, we introduce our CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD) approach, a straightforward but effective training-free approach to reduce object hallucination at decoding time. CGD uses CLIP to guide the model's decoding process by enhancing visual grounding of generated text with the image. Experiments demonstrate that CGD effectively mitigates object hallucination across multiple LVLM families while preserving the utility of text generation.

- **Summary**: The adoption of tablets with touchscreens and styluses is increasing, and a key feature is converting handwriting to text, enabling search, indexing, and AI assistance. Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) are now the go-to solution for image understanding, thanks to both their state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks and the simplicity of a unified approach to training, fine-tuning, and inference. While VLMs obtain high performance on image-based tasks, they perform poorly on handwriting recognition when applied naively, i.e., by rendering handwriting as an image and performing optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper, we study online handwriting recognition with VLMs, going beyond naive OCR. We propose a novel tokenized representation of digital ink (online handwriting) that includes both a time-ordered sequence of strokes as text, and as image. We show that this representation yields results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art online handwriting recognizers. Wide applicability is shown through results with two different VLM families, on multiple public datasets. Our approach can be applied to off-the-shelf VLMs, does not require any changes in their architecture, and can be used in both fine-tuning and parameter-efficient tuning. We perform a detailed ablation study to identify the key elements of the proposed representation.

- **Summary**: The roto-translation group SE2 has been of active interest in image analysis due to methods that lift the image data to multi-orientation representations defined on this Lie group. This has led to impactful applications of crossing-preserving flows for image de-noising, geodesic tracking, and roto-translation equivariant deep learning. In this paper, we develop a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE2. We make several theoretical contributions (generalizable to matrix Lie groups) such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. We develop a Sinkhorn like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group convolutions. We report valuable advancements in the experiments on 1) image barycenters, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE2. We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE2 and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image. This yields sharper and more meaningful interpolations compared to their counterparts on $\mathbb{R}^2$

- **Summary**: Current hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) benchmark datasets suffer from low resolution, simple background, and small size of the detection data. These factors also limit the performance of the well-known low-rank representation (LRR) models in terms of robustness on the separation of background and target features and the reliance on manual parameter selection. To this end, we build a new set of HAD benchmark datasets for improving the robustness of the HAD algorithm in complex scenarios, AIR-HAD for short. Accordingly, we propose a generalized and interpretable HAD network by deeply unfolding a dictionary-learnable LLR model, named LRR-Net$^+$, which is capable of spectrally decoupling the background structure and object properties in a more generalized fashion and eliminating the bias introduced by vital interference targets concurrently. In addition, LRR-Net$^+$ integrates the solution process of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimizer with the deep network, guiding its search process and imparting a level of interpretability to parameter optimization. Additionally, the integration of physical models with DL techniques eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning. The manually tuned parameters are seamlessly transformed into trainable parameters for deep neural networks, facilitating a more efficient and automated optimization process. Extensive experiments conducted on the AIR-HAD dataset show the superiority of our LRR-Net$^+$ in terms of detection performance and generalization ability, compared to top-performing rivals. Furthermore, the compilable codes and our AIR-HAD benchmark datasets in this paper will be made available freely and openly at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/danfeng-hong}.

- **Summary**: Automated machine learning (AutoML) is a collection of techniques designed to automate the machine learning development process. While traditional AutoML approaches have been successfully applied in several critical steps of model development (e.g. hyperparameter optimization), there lacks a AutoML system that automates the entire end-to-end model production workflow. To fill this blank, we present AutoMMLab, a general-purpose LLM-empowered AutoML system that follows user's language instructions to automate the whole model production workflow for computer vision tasks. The proposed AutoMMLab system effectively employs LLMs as the bridge to connect AutoML and OpenMMLab community, empowering non-expert individuals to easily build task-specific models via a user-friendly language interface. Specifically, we propose RU-LLaMA to understand users' request and schedule the whole pipeline, and propose a novel LLM-based hyperparameter optimizer called HPO-LLaMA to effectively search for the optimal hyperparameters. Experiments show that our AutoMMLab system is versatile and covers a wide range of mainstream tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation and keypoint estimation. We further develop a new benchmark, called LAMP, for studying key components in the end-to-end prompt-based model training pipeline. Code, model, and data will be released.

- **Summary**: Image denoising is probably the oldest and still one of the most active research topic in image processing. Many methodological concepts have been introduced in the past decades and have improved performances significantly in recent years, especially with the emergence of convolutional neural networks and supervised deep learning. In this paper, we propose a survey of guided tour of supervised and unsupervised learning methods for image denoising, classifying the main principles elaborated during this evolution, with a particular concern given to recent developments in supervised learning. It is conceived as a tutorial organizing in a comprehensive framework current approaches. We give insights on the rationales and limitations of the most performant methods in the literature, and we highlight the common features between many of them. Finally, we focus on on the normalization equivariance properties that is surprisingly not guaranteed with most of supervised methods. It is of paramount importance that intensity shifting or scaling applied to the input image results in a corresponding change in the denoiser output.

- **Summary**: Outlier detection is an essential capability in safety-critical applications of supervised visual recognition. Most of the existing methods deliver best results by encouraging standard closed-set models to produce low-confidence predictions in negative training data. However, that approach conflates prediction uncertainty with recognition of the negative class. We therefore reconsider direct prediction of K+1 logits that correspond to K groundtruth classes and one outlier class. This setup allows us to formulate a novel anomaly score as an ensemble of in-distribution uncertainty and the posterior of the outlier class which we term negative objectness. Now outliers can be independently detected due to i) high prediction uncertainty or ii) similarity with negative data. We embed our method into a dense prediction architecture with mask-level recognition over K+2 classes. The training procedure encourages the novel K+2-th class to learn negative objectness at pasted negative instances. Our models outperform the current state-of-the art on standard benchmarks for image-wide and pixel-level outlier detection with and without training on real negative data.

- **Summary**: We introduce Genie, the first generative interactive environment trained in an unsupervised manner from unlabelled Internet videos. The model can be prompted to generate an endless variety of action-controllable virtual worlds described through text, synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches. At 11B parameters, Genie can be considered a foundation world model. It is comprised of a spatiotemporal video tokenizer, an autoregressive dynamics model, and a simple and scalable latent action model. Genie enables users to act in the generated environments on a frame-by-frame basis despite training without any ground-truth action labels or other domain-specific requirements typically found in the world model literature. Further the resulting learned latent action space facilitates training agents to imitate behaviors from unseen videos, opening the path for training generalist agents of the future.

- **Summary**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning stands as the standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language and vision models on downstream tasks. Specifically, the efficiency of low-rank adaptation has facilitated the creation and sharing of hundreds of custom LoRA modules, each trained on distinct data from various downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the composability of LoRA modules, examining if combining these pre-trained modules enhances generalization to unseen downstream tasks. Our investigation involves evaluating two approaches: (a) uniform composition, involving averaging upstream LoRA modules with equal weights, and (b) learned composition, where we learn the weights for each upstream module and perform weighted averaging. Our experimental results on both vision and language models reveal that in few-shot settings, where only a limited number of samples are available for the downstream task, both uniform and learned composition methods result in better transfer accuracy; outperforming full fine-tuning and training a LoRA from scratch. Moreover, in full-shot settings, learned composition performs comparably to regular LoRA training with significantly fewer number of trainable parameters. Our research unveils the potential of uniform composition for enhancing transferability in low-shot settings, without introducing additional learnable parameters.

- **Summary**: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models (DMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating high-quality images based on simple text descriptions. However, as is common with many Deep Learning (DL) models, DMs are subject to a lack of robustness. While there are attempts to evaluate the robustness of T2I DMs as a binary or worst-case problem, they cannot answer how robust in general the model is whenever an adversarial example (AE) can be found. In this study, we first introduce a probabilistic notion of T2I DMs' robustness; and then establish an efficient framework, ProTIP, to evaluate it with statistical guarantees. The main challenges stem from: i) the high computational cost of the generation process; and ii) determining if a perturbed input is an AE involves comparing two output distributions, which is fundamentally harder compared to other DL tasks like classification where an AE is identified upon misprediction of labels. To tackle the challenges, we employ sequential analysis with efficacy and futility early stopping rules in the statistical testing for identifying AEs, and adaptive concentration inequalities to dynamically determine the "just-right" number of stochastic perturbations whenever the verification target is met. Empirical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ProTIP over common T2I DMs. Finally, we demonstrate an application of ProTIP to rank commonly used defence methods.

- **Summary**: Developing robust and interpretable vision systems is a crucial step towards trustworthy artificial intelligence. In this regard, a promising paradigm considers embedding task-required invariant structures, e.g., geometric invariance, in the fundamental image representation. However, such invariant representations typically exhibit limited discriminability, limiting their applications in larger-scale trustworthy vision tasks. For this open problem, we conduct a systematic investigation of hierarchical invariance, exploring this topic from theoretical, practical, and application perspectives. At the theoretical level, we show how to construct over-complete invariants with a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-like hierarchical architecture yet in a fully interpretable manner. The general blueprint, specific definitions, invariant properties, and numerical implementations are provided. At the practical level, we discuss how to customize this theoretical framework into a given task. With the over-completeness, discriminative features w.r.t. the task can be adaptively formed in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-like manner. We demonstrate the above arguments with accuracy, invariance, and efficiency results on texture, digit, and parasite classification experiments. Furthermore, at the application level, our representations are explored in real-world forensics tasks on adversarial perturbations and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Such applications reveal that the proposed strategy not only realizes the theoretically promised invariance, but also exhibits competitive discriminability even in the era of deep learning. For robust and interpretable vision tasks at larger scales, hierarchical invariant representation can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional CNN and invariants.

- **Summary**: The task of multimedia geolocation is becoming an increasingly essential component of the digital forensics toolkit to effectively combat human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and other illegal acts. Typically, metadata-based geolocation information is stripped when multimedia content is shared via instant messaging and social media. The intricacy of geolocating, geotagging, or finding geographical clues in this content is often overly burdensome for investigators. Recent research has shown that contemporary advancements in artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision and deep learning, show significant promise towards expediting the multimedia geolocation task. This systematic literature review thoroughly examines the state-of-the-art leveraging computer vision techniques for multimedia geolocation and assesses their potential to expedite human trafficking investigation. This includes a comprehensive overview of the application of computer vision-based approaches to multimedia geolocation, identifies their applicability in combating human trafficking, and highlights the potential implications of enhanced multimedia geolocation for prosecuting human trafficking. 123 articles inform this systematic literature review. The findings suggest numerous potential paths for future impactful research on the subject.

- **Summary**: We present CLIPPER+, an algorithm for finding maximal cliques in unweighted graphs for outlier-robust global registration. The registration problem can be formulated as a graph and solved by finding its maximum clique. This formulation leads to extreme robustness to outliers; however, finding the maximum clique is an NP-hard problem, and therefore approximation is required in practice for large-size problems. The performance of an approximation algorithm is evaluated by its computational complexity (the lower the runtime, the better) and solution accuracy (how close the solution is to the maximum clique). Accordingly, the main contribution of CLIPPER+ is outperforming the state-of-the-art in accuracy while maintaining a relatively low runtime. CLIPPER+ builds on prior work (CLIPPER [1] and PMC [2]) and prunes the graph by removing vertices that have a small core number and cannot be a part of the maximum clique. This will result in a smaller graph, on which the maximum clique can be estimated considerably faster. We evaluate the performance of CLIPPER+ on standard graph benchmarks, as well as synthetic and real-world point cloud registration problems. These evaluations demonstrate that CLIPPER+ has the highest accuracy and can register point clouds in scenarios where over $99\%$ of associations are outliers. Our code and evaluation benchmarks are released at https://github.com/ariarobotics/clipperp.

- **Summary**: Precise situational awareness is required for the safe decision-making of assisted and automated driving (AAD) functions. Panoptic segmentation is a promising perception technique to identify and categorise objects, impending hazards, and driveable space at a pixel level. While segmentation quality is generally associated with the quality of the camera data, a comprehensive understanding and modelling of this relationship are paramount for AAD system designers. Motivated by such a need, this work proposes a unifying pipeline to assess the robustness of panoptic segmentation models for AAD, correlating it with traditional image quality. The first step of the proposed pipeline involves generating degraded camera data that reflects real-world noise factors. To this end, 19 noise factors have been identified and implemented with 3 severity levels. Of these factors, this work proposes novel models for unfavourable light and snow. After applying the degradation models, three state-of-the-art CNN- and vision transformers (ViT)-based panoptic segmentation networks are used to analyse their robustness. The variations of the segmentation performance are then correlated to 8 selected image quality metrics. This research reveals that: 1) certain specific noise factors produce the highest impact on panoptic segmentation, i.e. droplets on lens and Gaussian noise; 2) the ViT-based panoptic segmentation backbones show better robustness to the considered noise factors; 3) some image quality metrics (i.e. LPIPS and CW-SSIM) correlate strongly with panoptic segmentation performance and therefore they can be used as predictive metrics for network performance.

- **Summary**: Foveated vision, a trait shared by many animals, including humans, has not been fully utilized in machine learning applications, despite its significant contributions to biological visual function. This study investigates whether retinotopic mapping, a critical component of foveated vision, can enhance image categorization and localization performance when integrated into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Retinotopic mapping was integrated into the inputs of standard off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were then retrained on the ImageNet task. As expected, the logarithmic-polar mapping improved the network's ability to handle arbitrary image zooms and rotations, particularly for isolated objects. Surprisingly, the retinotopically mapped network achieved comparable performance in classification. Furthermore, the network demonstrated improved classification localization when the foveated center of the transform was shifted. This replicates a crucial ability of the human visual system that is absent in typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These findings suggest that retinotopic mapping may be fundamental to significant preattentive visual processes.

- **Summary**: Robots need to explore their surroundings to adapt to and tackle tasks in unknown environments. Prior work has proposed building scene graphs of the environment but typically assumes that the environment is static, omitting regions that require active interactions. This severely limits their ability to handle more complex tasks in household and office environments: before setting up a table, robots must explore drawers and cabinets to locate all utensils and condiments. In this work, we introduce the novel task of interactive scene exploration, wherein robots autonomously explore environments and produce an action-conditioned scene graph (ACSG) that captures the structure of the underlying environment. The ACSG accounts for both low-level information, such as geometry and semantics, and high-level information, such as the action-conditioned relationships between different entities in the scene. To this end, we present the Robotic Exploration (RoboEXP) system, which incorporates the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) and an explicit memory design to enhance our system's capabilities. The robot reasons about what and how to explore an object, accumulating new information through the interaction process and incrementally constructing the ACSG. We apply our system across various real-world settings in a zero-shot manner, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploring and modeling environments it has never seen before. Leveraging the constructed ACSG, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our RoboEXP system in facilitating a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involving rigid, articulated objects, nested objects like Matryoshka dolls, and deformable objects like cloth.

- **Summary**: Recent text-to-image diffusion models are able to learn and synthesize images containing novel, personalized concepts (e.g., their own pets or specific items) with just a few examples for training. This paper tackles two interconnected issues within this realm of personalizing text-to-image diffusion models. First, current personalization techniques fail to reliably extend to multiple concepts -- we hypothesize this to be due to the mismatch between complex scenes and simple text descriptions in the pre-training dataset (e.g., LAION). Second, given an image containing multiple personalized concepts, there lacks a holistic metric that evaluates performance on not just the degree of resemblance of personalized concepts, but also whether all concepts are present in the image and whether the image accurately reflects the overall text description. To address these issues, we introduce Gen4Gen, a semi-automated dataset creation pipeline utilizing generative models to combine personalized concepts into complex compositions along with text-descriptions. Using this, we create a dataset called MyCanvas, that can be used to benchmark the task of multi-concept personalization. In addition, we design a comprehensive metric comprising two scores (CP-CLIP and TI-CLIP) for better quantifying the performance of multi-concept, personalized text-to-image diffusion methods. We provide a simple baseline built on top of Custom Diffusion with empirical prompting strategies for future researchers to evaluate on MyCanvas. We show that by improving data quality and prompting strategies, we can significantly increase multi-concept personalized image generation quality, without requiring any modifications to model architecture or training algorithms.

- **Summary**: Steering the behavior of a strong model pre-trained on internet-scale data can be difficult due to the scarcity of competent supervisors. Recent studies reveal that, despite supervisory noises, a strong student model may surpass its weak teacher when fine-tuned on specific objectives. Yet, the effectiveness of such weak-to-strong generalization remains limited, especially in the presence of large capability gaps. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by harnessing a diverse set of specialized teachers, instead of a single generalist one, that collectively supervises the strong student. Our approach resembles the classical hierarchical mixture of experts, with two components tailored for co-supervision: (i) we progressively alternate student training and teacher assignment, leveraging the growth of the strong student to identify plausible supervisions; (ii) we conservatively enforce teacher-student and local-global consistency, leveraging their dependencies to reject potential annotation noises. We validate the proposed method through visual recognition tasks on the OpenAI weak-to-strong benchmark and additional multi-domain datasets.

- **Summary**: Grokking, or delayed generalization, is a phenomenon where generalization in a deep neural network (DNN) occurs long after achieving near zero training error. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific controlled settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or transformers trained on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is actually much more widespread and materializes in a wide range of practical settings, such as training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10 or a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new concept of delayed robustness, whereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes robust, long after interpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical explanation for the emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness based on a new measure of the local complexity of a DNN's input-output mapping. Our local complexity measures the density of the so-called 'linear regions' (aka, spline partition regions) that tile the DNN input space, and serves as a utile progress measure for training. We provide the first evidence that for classification problems, the linear regions undergo a phase transition during training whereafter they migrate away from the training samples (making the DNN mapping smoother there) and towards the decision boundary (making the DNN mapping less smooth there). Grokking occurs post phase transition as a robust partition of the input space emerges thanks to the linearization of the DNN mapping around the training points.

- **Summary**: Conditional human motion generation is an important topic with many applications in virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. While prior works have focused on generating motion guided by text, music, or scenes, these typically result in isolated motions confined to short durations. Instead, we address the generation of long, continuous sequences guided by a series of varying textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce FlowMDM, the first diffusion-based model that generates seamless Human Motion Compositions (HMC) without any postprocessing or redundant denoising steps. For this, we introduce the Blended Positional Encodings, a technique that leverages both absolute and relative positional encodings in the denoising chain. More specifically, global motion coherence is recovered at the absolute stage, whereas smooth and realistic transitions are built at the relative stage. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy, realism, and smoothness on the Babel and HumanML3D datasets. FlowMDM excels when trained with only a single description per motion sequence thanks to its Pose-Centric Cross-ATtention, which makes it robust against varying text descriptions at inference time. Finally, to address the limitations of existing HMC metrics, we propose two new metrics: the Peak Jerk and the Area Under the Jerk, to detect abrupt transitions.

- **Summary**: Recently, there has been great progress in the ability of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to classify dermatological conditions from clinical photographs. However, little is known about the robustness of these algorithms in real-world settings where several factors can lead to a loss of generalizability. Understanding and overcoming these limitations will permit the development of generalizable AI that can aid in the diagnosis of skin conditions across a variety of clinical settings. In this retrospective study, we demonstrate that differences in skin condition distribution, rather than in demographics or image capture mode are the main source of errors when an AI algorithm is evaluated on data from a previously unseen source. We demonstrate a series of steps to close this generalization gap, requiring progressively more information about the new source, ranging from the condition distribution to training data enriched for data less frequently seen during training. Our results also suggest comparable performance from end-to-end fine tuning versus fine tuning solely the classification layer on top of a frozen embedding model. Our approach can inform the adaptation of AI algorithms to new settings, based on the information and resources available.

- **Summary**: The rapid evolution of automated vehicles (AVs) has the potential to provide safer, more efficient, and comfortable travel options. However, these systems face challenges regarding reliability in complex driving scenarios. Recent explainable AV architectures neglect crucial information related to inherent uncertainties while providing explanations for actions. To overcome such challenges, our study builds upon the "object-induced" model approach that prioritizes the role of objects in scenes for decision-making and integrates uncertainty assessment into the decision-making process using an evidential deep learning paradigm with a Beta prior. Additionally, we explore several advanced training strategies guided by uncertainty, including uncertainty-guided data reweighting and augmentation. Leveraging the BDD-OIA dataset, our findings underscore that the model, through these enhancements, not only offers a clearer comprehension of AV decisions and their underlying reasoning but also surpasses existing baselines across a broad range of scenarios.

- **Summary**: Table structure recognition (TSR) aims to convert tabular images into a machine-readable format. Although hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-transformer architecture is widely used in existing approaches, linear projection transformer has outperformed the hybrid architecture in numerous vision tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing research has demonstrated that a direct replacement of CNN backbone with linear projection leads to a marked performance drop. In this work, we resolve the issue by proposing a self-supervised pre-training (SSP) method for TSR transformers. We discover that the performance gap between the linear projection transformer and the hybrid CNN-transformer can be mitigated by SSP of the visual encoder in the TSR model. We conducted reproducible ablation studies and open-sourced our code at https://github.com/poloclub/unitable to enhance transparency, inspire innovations, and facilitate fair comparisons in our domain as tables are a promising modality for representation learning.

- **Summary**: This paper explores the challenge of procedure planning in instructional videos, which involves creating goal-directed plans based on visual start and goal observations from videos. Previous research has tackled this problem with gradually weaker training supervision, from heavy intermediate visual observations or language instructions to task class supervision. However, with the advent of large language models, even given only the task name, these models can produce a detailed plan. In this study, we propose a much weaker setting without task name as supervision, which is not currently solvable by existing large language models since they require good prompts with sufficient information. Specifically, we hypothesize that previous intermediate supervisions can serve as context information, and we use captions of visual start and goal observations as a much cheaper form of supervision. This approach greatly reduces the labeling cost since the captions can be easily obtained by large pre-trained vision-language foundation models. Technically, we apply BLIP to generate captions as supervision to train the context feature with contrastive learning loss. Afterward, the context feature is fed into the generator to aid in plan generation. Our experiments on two datasets with varying scales demonstrate that our model can achieve comparable performance on multiple metrics, which validates our hypothesis.

- **Summary**: Due to the lack of depth cues in images, multi-frame inputs are important for the success of vision-based perception, prediction, and planning in autonomous driving. Observations from different angles enable the recovery of 3D object states from 2D image inputs if we can identify the same instance in different input frames. However, the dynamic nature of autonomous driving scenes leads to significant changes in the appearance and shape of each instance captured by the camera at different time steps. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning algorithm, Cohere3D, to learn coherent instance representations in a long-term input sequence robust to the change in distance and perspective. The learned representation aids in instance-level correspondence across multiple input frames in downstream tasks. In the pretraining stage, the raw point clouds from LiDAR sensors are utilized to construct the long-term temporal correspondence for each instance, which serves as guidance for the extraction of instance-level representation from the vision-based bird's eye-view (BEV) feature map. Cohere3D encourages a consistent representation for the same instance at different frames but distinguishes between representations of different instances. We evaluate our algorithm by finetuning the pretrained model on various downstream perception, prediction, and planning tasks. Results show a notable improvement in both data efficiency and task performance.

- **Summary**: Today, state-of-the-art deep neural networks that process event-camera data first convert a temporal window of events into dense, grid-like input representations. As such, they exhibit poor generalizability when deployed at higher inference frequencies (i.e., smaller temporal windows) than the ones they were trained on. We address this challenge by introducing state-space models (SSMs) with learnable timescale parameters to event-based vision. This design adapts to varying frequencies without the need to retrain the network at different frequencies. Additionally, we investigate two strategies to counteract aliasing effects when deploying the model at higher frequencies. We comprehensively evaluate our approach against existing methods based on RNN and Transformer architectures across various benchmarks, including Gen1 and 1 Mpx event camera datasets. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based models train 33% faster and also exhibit minimal performance degradation when tested at higher frequencies than the training input. Traditional RNN and Transformer models exhibit performance drops of more than 20 mAP, with SSMs having a drop of 3.31 mAP, highlighting the effectiveness of SSMs in event-based vision tasks.

- **Summary**: Achieving resiliency against adversarial attacks is necessary prior to deploying neural network classifiers in domains where misclassification incurs substantial costs, e.g., self-driving cars or medical imaging. Recent work has demonstrated that robustness can be transferred from an adversarially trained teacher to a student model using knowledge distillation. However, current methods perform distillation using a single adversarial and vanilla teacher and consider homogeneous architectures (i.e., residual networks) that are susceptible to misclassify examples from similar adversarial subspaces. In this work, we develop a defense framework against adversarial attacks by distilling adversarial robustness using heterogeneous teachers (DARHT). In DARHT, the student model explicitly represents teacher logits in a student-teacher feature map and leverages multiple teachers that exhibit low adversarial example transferability (i.e., exhibit high performance on dissimilar adversarial examples). Experiments on classification tasks in both white-box and black-box scenarios demonstrate that DARHT achieves state-of-the-art clean and robust accuracies when compared to competing adversarial training and distillation methods in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Comparisons with homogeneous and heterogeneous teacher sets suggest that leveraging teachers with low adversarial example transferability increases student model robustness.

- **Summary**: Shape modeling is a challenging task with many potential applications in computer vision and medical imaging. There are many shape modeling methods in the literature, each with its advantages and applications. However, many shape modeling methods have difficulties handling shapes that have missing pieces or outliers. In this regard, this paper introduces shape denoising, a fundamental problem in shape modeling that lies at the core of many computer vision and medical imaging applications and has not received enough attention in the literature. The paper introduces six types of noise that can be used to perturb shapes as well as an objective measure for the noise level and for comparing methods on their shape denoising capabilities. Finally, the paper evaluates seven methods capable of accomplishing this task, of which six are based on deep learning, including some generative models.

- **Summary**: Often, applications of self-supervised learning to 3D medical data opt to use 3D variants of successful 2D network architectures. Although promising approaches, they are significantly more computationally demanding to train, and thus reduce the widespread applicability of these methods away from those with modest computational resources. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve standard 2D SSL algorithms by modelling the inherent 3D nature of these datasets implicitly. We propose two variants that build upon a strong baseline model and show that both of these variants often outperform the baseline in a variety of downstream tasks. Importantly, in contrast to previous works in both 2D and 3D approaches for 3D medical data, both of our proposals introduce negligible additional overhead over the baseline, improving the democratisation of these approaches for medical applications.

- **Summary**: We investigate both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based methods for recovering a complex-valued signal from multiple sets of measurements, referred to as looks, affected by speckle (multiplicative) noise. Our theoretical contributions include establishing the first existing theoretical upper bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep image prior hypothesis. Our theoretical results capture the dependence of MSE upon the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we introduce the concept of bagged Deep Image Priors (Bagged-DIP) and integrate them with projected gradient descent. Furthermore, we show how employing Newton-Schulz algorithm for calculating matrix inverses within the iterations of PGD reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm. We will show that this method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

- **Summary**: Recent years have witnessed great progress in image restoration thanks to the advancements in modern deep neural networks e.g. Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer. However, existing restoration backbones are usually limited due to the inherent local reductive bias or quadratic computational complexity. Recently, Selective Structured State Space Model e.g., Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependencies modeling with linear complexity, but it is still under-explored in low-level computer vision. In this work, we introduce a simple but strong benchmark model, named MambaIR, for image restoration. In detail, we propose the Residual State Space Block as the core component, which employs convolution and channel attention to enhance the capabilities of the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of local patch recurrence prior as well as channel interaction to produce restoration-specific feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms Transformer-based baseline SwinIR by up to 0.36dB, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

- **Summary**: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved success in computer vision tasks, it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Such attacks could mislead the victim model to make attacker-chosen prediction with a specific trigger pattern. Until now, the trigger injection of existing attacks is mainly limited to spatial domain. Recent works take advantage of perceptual properties of planting specific patterns in the frequency domain, which only reflect indistinguishable pixel-wise perturbations in pixel domain. However, in the black-box setup, the inaccessibility of training process often renders more complex trigger designs. Existing frequency attacks simply handcraft the magnitude of spectrum, introducing anomaly frequency disparities between clean and poisoned data and taking risks of being removed by image processing operations (such as lossy compression and filtering). In this paper, we propose a robust low-frequency black-box backdoor attack (LFBA), which minimally perturbs low-frequency components of frequency spectrum and maintains the perceptual similarity in spatial space simultaneously. The key insight of our attack restrict the search for the optimal trigger to low-frequency region that can achieve high attack effectiveness, robustness against image transformation defenses and stealthiness in dual space. We utilize simulated annealing (SA), a form of evolutionary algorithm, to optimize the properties of frequency trigger including the number of manipulated frequency bands and the perturbation of each frequency component, without relying on the knowledge from the victim classifier. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and robustness of LFBA against image processing operations and the state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, as well as its inherent stealthiness in both spatial and frequency space, making it resilient against frequency inspection.
